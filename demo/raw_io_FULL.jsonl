I got a 695. Not super close but close enough that after the test I know now what I really need to work on and of course I found out each area I got questions wrong from the printout. However, the second attempt study plan to get a 2nd voucher is crazy! It requires finishing 100% of CertMaster Perform, all 5 modules in CertMaster Practice, 5 quizzes, 1 practice exam of 90% or higher, and 2 Dion exams with 90% or higher. I also have to submit screenshots of all practice exams. Once everything is done and submitted then I can get approval. \n\nI feel like this is way overboard. The sheer amount of time it would consume is insane when I didn't completely bomb my first attempt. Has anyone experienced this? I haven't had this professor before for any other classes and my 1st attempt was with a different professor (took test 2 days before term ended) and this new term it was assigned to a different professor. \n\nAny advice?", "raw_response_text": "Here is the JSON object:\n\n{\n\"contains_painpoint\": \"y\",\n\"confidence\": 0.8,\n\"pain_points\": [\n{\n\"root_cause_summary\": \"Excessive requirements for the second attempt study plan\",\n\"pain_point_snippet\": \"It requires finishing 100% of CertMaster Perform, all 5 modules in CertMaster Practice, 5 quizzes, 1 practice exam of 90% or higher, and 2 Dion exams with 90% or higher.\"\n}\n]\n}\n\nNote: I labeled the post as containing a pain point because the student expresses frustration and feels that the requirements for the second attempt study plan are excessive.
