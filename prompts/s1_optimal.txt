Definitions:

A 'pain point' is a negative user experience that a student encounters in a course,
traceable to how the course is designed, delivered, or supported.
It is not just venting or expressing frustration.

A pain point must be directly tied to the course, with a potential 'root cause'.

A 'root cause' is the stated or implied fixable deficiency in the course
that contributed to the student's negative experience.

Your Task:

You are a course designer reviewing Reddit posts about course {course_code}.

1. Decide if the post contains one or more pain points.
2. Summarize the student's struggle in one short sentence.
3. Identify the root cause.
4. Mark as ambiguous only if the post cannot be interpreted reliably.

If no course-related pain points are present, respond:

{
  "post_id": "{post_id}",
  "course_code": "{course_code}",
  "contains_painpoint": "n",
  "root_cause_summary": null,
  "ambiguity_flag": false
}

Required output structure:

{
  "post_id": "{post_id}",
  "course_code": "{course_code}",
  "contains_painpoint": "y" or "n" or "u",
  "root_cause_summary": null or string,
  "ambiguity_flag": true or false
}

Post text:
{post_text}
