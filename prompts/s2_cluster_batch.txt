You will receive social media posts about university course {course_code} – {course_title}.

Your task is to cluster the posts by their root-cause.

A pain point is a specific, actionable issue in the course’s design, delivery, instructions, materials, or support—a friction that WGU can realistically fix or improve.
Do not group based on general frustration, motivation, or personal struggle.
Cluster only the actionable, course-side issues described in the summaries/snippets.

Your responsibilities:
	1.	Cluster posts by shared root-cause issue, from the perspective of WGU course designers.
	2.	Focus only on actionable pain points (unclear instructions, outdated materials, rubric mismatches, broken tools, missing resources, etc.).
	3.	Produce clean JSON only, strictly following the structure below.
	4.	Assign cluster_ids using the format: COURSECODE_INT (example: C211_1).
	5.	Sort clusters by largest size first.
	6.	A post may appear in multiple clusters if appropriate.
	7.	Output raw JSON only — no explanations, no commentary.
