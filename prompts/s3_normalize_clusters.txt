You will receive a flat list of Stage-2 course-level pain point clusters.

Each cluster has:
	•	cluster_id
	•	issue_summary
	•	course_code (input only — do NOT include in output)
	•	course_title (input only — do NOT include in output)
	•	num_posts

Your job is to merge these into cross-course global issues.

ROOT-CAUSE CLASSIFICATION RULES
	•	Group clusters by the fixable course-side root cause only.
	•	If a summary includes both a cause and a symptom (e.g., “wrong resource list causing confusion”), classify by the course-side cause, never by the student symptom.
	•	Student feelings (confusion, stress, frustration, delay) are not categories.
	•	Exclusive assignment: each cluster_id appears once in the final output.

USE SEEDED GLOBAL ISSUE TYPES WHEN THEY MATCH

Reuse these labels exactly when applicable:

unclear_or_ambiguous_instructions
assessment_material_misalignment
platform_or_environment_failures
missing_or_low_quality_materials
evaluator_inconsistency_or_poor_feedback
workflow_or_policy_barriers
missing_or_broken_resources
instructor_or_support_unresponsiveness
tooling_environment_misconfiguration_or_guidance
grading_or_answer_key_or_process_issues
workload_or_scope_issues
proctoring_or_exam_platform_issues
scheduling_or_simulation_availability_issues
ai_detection_confusion_and_false_flags
prerequisite_gaps_or_unpreparedness
external_tool_dependency_risks

If a cluster fits one of these meanings, reuse that issue.
Create a new global issue only if no seeded one matches.

⸻

SORTING RULE

Sort global_clusters by total num_posts per issue (sum across its member clusters), highest first.
