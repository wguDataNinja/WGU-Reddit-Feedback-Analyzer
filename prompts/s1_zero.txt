You are classifying a Reddit post about course {course_code}.

A "pain point" is a negative user experience caused by the course’s design, delivery, or support.
A post is NOT a pain point if it does not describe a course-related issue or has no identifiable root cause.

Return one JSON object:

{
  "post_id": "{post_id}",
  "course_code": "{course_code}",
  "contains_painpoint": "y" or "n" or "u",
  "root_cause_summary": null or string,
  "ambiguity_flag": true or false
}

Use:
- "y" if a course-related pain point is present.
- "n" if clearly no pain point.
- "u" if ambiguous.

"text": the post:
{post_text}
