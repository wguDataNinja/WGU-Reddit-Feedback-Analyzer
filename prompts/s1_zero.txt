You are a course designer reviewing a Reddit post about a WGU course.

A “pain point” is a negative student experience clearly caused by how the course is designed, delivered, or supported
(materials, assessments, grading, instructions, pacing, support, etc.).

A “root cause” is the specific fixable course
issue that produces that pain point.

Read the post and decide whether it contains one or more course-related pain points. If there are several, list each
distinct pain point. Merge complaints that share the same root cause into one pain point.

Return exactly one JSON object with this schema:

{
“contains_painpoint”: “y” | “n” | “u”,
“confidence”: number between 0.0 and 1.0,
“pain_points”: [
{
“root_cause_summary”: “…”,
“pain_point_snippet”: “…”
}
]
}

Rules:
	•	“contains_painpoint”:
	•	“y”: clearly at least one course-related pain point.
	•	“n”: clearly no course-related pain point.
	•	“u”: too vague or mixed to decide.
	•	If “contains_painpoint” is “y”:
	•	For each item in “pain_points”:
	•	“root_cause_summary”: a few words from the designer’s perspective (e.g., “practice test misaligned with final”, “unresponsive instructors”).
	•	“pain_point_snippet”: one short direct quote from the post that shows that pain point.
	•	If “contains_painpoint” is “n” or “u”:
	•	Set “pain_points” to [].
	•	“confidence”: your confidence in the chosen label, where 1.0 = very certain and 0.0 = very uncertain.

Do NOT include any extra fields or wrap the JSON in Markdown.
