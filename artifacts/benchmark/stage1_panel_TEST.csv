Use APA formatting for each paper, especially for the references page and in-text citation.

They helped a lot and though I did fail a second time, the report showed that I improved in a handful of places. My second OA went horrible however and the moment I sat down I felt things were going to go badly.

My protector was extremely nitpicking, much more than the others I’ve had in my other classes and my first attempt. She spent the first fifteen minutes complaining to me about the random kleenex box on the desk that I couldn’t touch if I reached for it (and other things 🙄) I know it’s their job but how can anyone cheat with a kleenex box? I would really like to know. After that, it went downhill. I was flustered with her constant bickering of random things and she interrupted me a few times during the test. I was out of focus majority of the time, but that was probably more my fault than hers.

Anyways, my question right now is what happens moving forward? I feel i’m never going to get through this course. I wish they gave us an option, assign me some paper I’ll ace that and write it in a day. But what the hell can I do? I’m ready to give up, I’m exhausted with it. I’ve never studied so much, not even when I was in school. I also have a gripe that wether pass or fail of the OA, you aren’t allowed to see what you got right and wrong. I understand for cheating purposes but I’d like to at least know if I got certain questions correct. Telling me I did good on the 32% of one subject but failed at another 32% doesn’t help me one bit. Did i fail that percent completely? Did i miss by one? 

The study plan that my instructor assigned me for the second fail is literally the same as the first with a few things added. Maybe it’s me but I can’t learn that way, I need to learn what I did good on and what I did wrong, making me do 10 modules of the same thing makes me not want to do it.

They helped a lot and though I did fail a second time, the report showed that I improved in a handful of places. My second OA went horrible however and the moment I sat down I felt things were going to go badly.

My protector was extremely nitpicking, much more than the others I’ve had in my other classes and my first attempt.

Anyways, my question right now is what happens moving forward? I feel i’m never going to get through this course.

Ok so I’ve been in IT for a long time but not in the cybersecurity field. I’ve primarily worked and managed for the Help Desk (currently a HD manager). 

The test:

67 questions with 5 PBQs (no drag and drops just select the best options)

Took an hour and some change. Went back and did a quick review, made at least 1 change to my answer and then submitted because I was like I’m probably gonna fail.  

Honestly I don’t remember much of it. I practically brain dumped when I walked out because I was overwhelmed and in disbelief that I passed.

I did the following to prep:

Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning Prep (watched at 1.5x speed)

CertMaster Learn for CySA+ (started doing the Practice questions first by Lessons. Reviewed whatever I got wrong the retook it and moved on to the next. Took the Final Assessment and scored 69% then first time. Reviewed whatever I got wrong then retook it 6 days later and scored a 90%. Did the PBQs until it got I got 100% on all of them. Finally, I did the Learning Plan to complete the whole course)

Pocket Prep CompTIA CySA+ (I did the Level Up Quiz portion primarily)

Jason Dion’s Complete Course/Practice Exams (2x speed - just to get through his content but still able to understand. I took each of his test twice and typically scored around mid 60’s the first time and then around low 90’s second time around)

Wiley Test Bank (Did the quizzes by domain first then did the final assessments twice. Same thing as Dion’s exams)

Total Seminar CySA+ Practice Exams on LinkedIn Learning (Same as above)

CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide (started it last week and only got to the end Chapter 6)

All of this took me pretty much 3 months because I work full time and I’m somewhat of a procrastinator. I tried to study as much as I can while at work because once I’m home, home life takes over and prior to today the last 5 months have been shitty. I lost my cousin to his battle with mental illness and my mom was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.

Good luck to whoever is going to take this course/exam. You got this!","D483 (CySA+) Passed

Holy crap I just passed this exam. I was completely shocked that I passed. 

Ok so I’ve been in IT for a long time but not in the cybersecurity field. I’ve primarily worked and managed for the Help Desk (currently a HD manager). 

The test:

67 questions with 5 PBQs (no drag and drops just select the best options)

Took an hour and some change. Went back and did a quick review, made at least 1 change to my answer and then submitted because I was like I’m probably gonna fail.  

Honestly I don’t remember much of it. I practically brain dumped when I walked out because I was overwhelmed and in disbelief that I passed.

I did the following to prep:

Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning Prep (watched at 1.5x speed)

CertMaster Learn for CySA+ (started doing the Practice questions first by Lessons. Reviewed whatever I got wrong the retook it and moved on to the next. Took the Final Assessment and scored 69% then first time. Reviewed whatever I got wrong then retook it 6 days later and scored a 90%. Did the PBQs until it got I got 100% on all of them. Finally, I did the Learning Plan to complete the whole course)

Pocket Prep CompTIA CySA+ (I did the Level Up Quiz portion primarily)

Jason Dion’s Complete Course/Practice Exams (2x speed - just to get through his content but still able to understand. I took each of his test twice and typically scored around mid 60’s the first time and then around low 90’s second time around)

Wiley Test Bank (Did the quizzes by domain first then did the final assessments twice. Same thing as Dion’s exams)

Total Seminar CySA+ Practice Exams on LinkedIn Learning (Same as above)

Use APA formatting for each paper, especially for the references page and in-text citation.

I wrote each paper in the format of a response after a number

You can also view examples at the very bottom of the page under “WEB LINKS”

Use APA formatting for each paper, especially for the references page and in-text citation.

I wrote each paper in the format of a response after a number
Example:
1. Blah blah blah
2. Blah blah blah

Use the requirements as an outline/template but erase the actual questions and just leave the numbers, otherwise it may be flagged for having a high percentage of “unoriginal work”.

They helped a lot and though I did fail a second time, the report showed that I improved in a handful of places. My second OA went horrible however and the moment I sat down I felt things were going to go badly.

My protector was extremely nitpicking, much more than the others I’ve had in my other classes and my first attempt. She spent the first fifteen minutes complaining to me about the random kleenex box on the desk that I couldn’t touch if I reached for it (and other things 🙄) I know it’s their job but how can anyone cheat with a kleenex box? I would really like to know. After that, it went downhill. I was flustered with her constant bickering of random things and she interrupted me a few times during the test. I was out of focus majority of the time, but that was probably more my fault than hers.

Anyways, my question right now is what happens moving forward? I feel i’m never going to get through this course. I wish they gave us an option, assign me some paper I’ll ace that and write it in a day. But what the hell can I do? I’m ready to give up, I’m exhausted with it. I’ve never studied so much, not even when I was in school. I also have a gripe that wether pass or fail of the OA, you aren’t allowed to see what you got right and wrong. I understand for cheating purposes but I’d like to at least know if I got certain questions correct. Telling me I did good on the 32% of one subject but failed at another 32% doesn’t help me one bit. Did i fail that percent completely? Did i miss by one? 

The study plan that my instructor assigned me for the second fail is literally the same as the first with a few things added. Maybe it’s me but I can’t learn that way, I need to learn what I did good on and what I did wrong, making me do 10 modules of the same thing makes me not want to do it.
