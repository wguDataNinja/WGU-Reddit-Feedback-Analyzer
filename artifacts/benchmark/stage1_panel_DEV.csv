I had my first meeting with my assigned mentor last week. It went well. Things seemed good. 

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th.

Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

I had my first meeting with my assigned mentor last week. It went well. Things seemed good. 

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

I have images, I can add things to my cart and checkout, but it just doesn't actually work because no data is being passed. The price field of the vacations is blank, customer information is blank…and the only errors being thrown is in the console for the main.ts and numbers are being passed as NaN. It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page. The only thing I can get to show is the order tracking number at the checkout purchase page, which required me to disable saving cart, cartItems, and customer (all three, I checked) to their repositories, so I'm pretty sure that's also not actually working and I've well and truly messed up somewhere. None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

Could this be just a mapping issue and I should redo all of my entities?

It's six pages, and my answers are to be 2-3 sentences, written in my own words, and to include what lesson, chapter, and page number where I found my answers. I have ADHD and I missed passing this OA by ""one or two"" questions, and this busy work (6 pg. Worksheet) super frustrates and overwhelms me. I'm coming to the conclustion that I'm likely not meant for this course, and I'm about to toss in the towel. I'm coming up on the end of the term, and I struggle spending another $5K (cost of living expenses to be enrolled full-time), when I feel like this last term was a complete f-ing waste of time and resources. I'm open to comments, suggestions, recommendations, or whatever you want to throw at me at this point.

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

Step 1. Take PA- See how smart or dumb you are.

Step 2. Look at your sections where you are dumb.

Step 3. Use this to study because they're very similar to the actual exam:

Step 4. Pass the OA



To be clear, I did not read any of the book, study any of the notes, watch any videos or try very hard. I personally do not think this class was very hard.



One last tip for you peeps. The OA will sometimes ask a question then later give you the answer in another question. Remember you have long time, me thinks 1.5-2 hours. I passed in 29 minutes.

Secondly, when you created the main.py code, did you have to call each of the three .py files using some sort of mlflow code?

I’ve been reading various posts about how to optimize the program but had a question on pre-assessment tests. 

I had my first meeting with my assigned mentor last week. It went well. Things seemed good. 

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Thanks","Question on Pre-Assessment

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Keep in mind that I received my BS from WGU as well, so I'm quite familiar with proctoring.  

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.  Like nearly all of us, I am in a full-time+ career and have a family--four college kids and two in elementary.  I literally don't have time for this  nonsense.","ProctorUgh

I realize that I messed up the positional awareness technique—that's on me. But do we have to do what we said in Task 1?

It all fits on one page just fine. So, should I just add another secondary nav element? Or follow the comments from the evaluator? 

I'm a little butthurt because I did the project in HTML and was pretty proud of it, but if I have to add that side menu bar because I talked about it in Task 1, I might have to start from scratch.

I have been stuck doing this class for almost two weeks now. I should've finished this class by now, but it keeps getting kicked back. 

In my latest attempt, I failed Task 2 - A4. The reason being, ""The prototype includes primary navigational elements.  The **secondary navigational** elements as described in Task 1 ""*another menu on the screen's left side*"" was not observed. A **positional awareness technique** (i.e., breadcrumbs, highlighting the current tab, etc.) was not observed.""

My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

I know a good amount of Python to where I can read it easy, but writing it from nothing especially when i cannot remember the formula for a hypotenuse. 

Or for instance,   
  
>!user\_input = int(input())!<



>!hours = int(user\_input // 3600)!<

>!minutes = int(user\_input % 3600) // 60!<

>!seconds = int(user\_input % 60)!<



>!print(f'Hours: {hours}')!<

>!print(f'Minutes: {minutes}')!<

>!print(f'Seconds: {seconds}')!<

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.

At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.

I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Keep in mind that I received my BS from WGU as well, so I'm quite familiar with proctoring.  

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.

I took my first OA last night with ProctorU.  I have never been more frustrated.  

Keep in mind that I received my BS from WGU as well, so I'm quite familiar with proctoring.  

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.

After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

I have images, I can add things to my cart and checkout, but it just doesn't actually work because no data is being passed. The price field of the vacations is blank, customer information is blank…and the only errors being thrown is in the console for the main.ts and numbers are being passed as NaN. It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page. The only thing I can get to show is the order tracking number at the checkout purchase page, which required me to disable saving cart, cartItems, and customer (all three, I checked) to their repositories, so I'm pretty sure that's also not actually working and I've well and truly messed up somewhere. None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

Could this be just a mapping issue and I should redo all of my entities? That was my first thought, but they all look accurate to the examples in material and other students that have had mapping issues. Or did I actually manage to break something important and need to just start over?

To be clear, I did not read any of the book, study any of the notes, watch any videos or try very hard. I personally do not think this class was very hard.



One last tip for you peeps. The OA will sometimes ask a question then later give you the answer in another question. Remember you have long time, me thinks 1.5-2 hours. I passed in 29 minutes.

Secondly, when you created the main.py code, did you have to call each of the three .py files using some sort of mlflow code? (Dr. Sewell's webinar suggested we do an mlflow run for each .py file we were calling as part of the run) I was just using subprocess.run, but I understand that may be incorrect.

Whatever I'm doing right now feels very wrong as I'm getting some kind of run_uuid error.

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Keep in mind that I received my BS from WGU as well, so I'm quite familiar with proctoring.  

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

I have images, I can add things to my cart and checkout, but it just doesn't actually work because no data is being passed. The price field of the vacations is blank, customer information is blank…and the only errors being thrown is in the console for the main.ts and numbers are being passed as NaN. It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page. The only thing I can get to show is the order tracking number at the checkout purchase page, which required me to disable saving cart, cartItems, and customer (all three, I checked) to their repositories, so I'm pretty sure that's also not actually working and I've well and truly messed up somewhere. None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

Each sentence was laden with corporate buzzwords, strung together in what felt like a tangled web of confusion. The actual information hidden within this linguistic chaos was akin to buried treasure in a minefield.

I embarked on this treacherous journey armed with determination and a dogged will to conquer this bureaucratic beast. But the path was riddled with frustration. The sheer volume of impenetrable terminology threatened to sink my spirits. It was a war of attrition against words that seemed to speak a language of their own, a coded dialect reserved for the initiated few.

And then came the day of reckoning, the exam itself. A Kafkaesque ordeal awaited me in the form of proctoring requirements that defied the laws of physics.

Studying for the ITIL v4 certification was like navigating a dense jungle of jargon, a thicket of words that seemed designed to obfuscate rather than illuminate. Each sentence was laden with corporate buzzwords, strung together in what felt like a tangled web of confusion. The actual information hidden within this linguistic chaos was akin to buried treasure in a minefield.

I embarked on this treacherous journey armed with determination and a dogged will to conquer this bureaucratic beast. But the path was riddled with frustration. The sheer volume of impenetrable terminology threatened to sink my spirits. It was a war of attrition against words that seemed to speak a language of their own, a coded dialect reserved for the initiated few.

And then came the day of reckoning, the exam itself. A Kafkaesque ordeal awaited me in the form of proctoring requirements that defied the laws of physics. The proctors, guardians of the digital realm, demanded the impossible. **They wanted eyes on my front door and hallway simultaneously, a logistical riddle wrapped in absurdity.**

Let me start by saying I have \~10 years of help desk experience, and many of those years, I was the one-stop shop for all things IT at those companies; looking back, I should have been called sys admin, but I didn't know any better.

Anyway, I took the pretest before I had access to the class, and I passed. So, the day the class opened, I studied what I didn't remember, took another pretest, and scored exemplary; later that evening, I passed the OA!

I mostly used a study and a Quizlet that I found searching Reddit and Discord. The OA was actually more difficult than I anticipated but nothing too major. I will link everything. Onto A+ software portion!!

I’ve been reading various posts about how to optimize the program but had a question on pre-assessment tests. 

I had my first meeting with my assigned mentor last week. It went well. Things seemed good. 

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Thanks","Question on Pre-Assessment

I start the WGU MBA program March 1st. I’ve been reading various posts about how to optimize the program but had a question on pre-assessment tests. 

I had my first meeting with my assigned mentor last week. It went well. Things seemed good. 

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment?

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.

No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.

My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.

My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page.

I took the PA several times for practice. The OA I took has many similarities to it (I don't know if the OA varies from person to person.) 

There were two long, difficult problems in chapter 28 - one was about a soccer roster, the other about credit card debt. There wasn't anything approaching those on the OA. The trickiest things I recall were the two questions about file operations, and that's just because I couldn't recall the precise syntax needed for them.

Hi, I'm currently studying for D335. I have completed 10 days of 100 days of coding per the recommendation from my C.I. Currently working on the practice labs and the pre-assessment.

Could someone tell me if the OA is the same as the PA, where you can check your output against the expected output? Also, if that is the case, does the expected output tell you if you are missing a whitespace, etc?

 Or can you only submit an output and not check?

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.

At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.

I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.

I know this question is subjective & varies from person to person, but I was just curious if anyone else has taken these courses & how long it took *them* to complete (and if they had any potential tips for any course!).



The only beast that I'm a bit scared of is the Web dev courses. I know nothing about the subject & heard c777 is a PITA!

And it basically does that for every page.
