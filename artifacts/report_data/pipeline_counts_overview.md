These counts describe how many posts flow through each stage of the pipeline for every course and college. They are useful for understanding data coverage and the kinds of issues that appear in the corpus, but they should not be used to rank courses by difficulty or overall quality.
The underlying dataset is a filtered, complaint-heavy subset of Reddit and does not represent all student experiences.
