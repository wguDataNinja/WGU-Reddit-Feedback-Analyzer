# F.1 Data scope and filtering

This section establishes the analysis scope and the catalog-based filtering rule used for college-level comparisons. College ownership is taken only from the course catalog. Post-level college fields are not used for ownership.

## Interpretation guardrails

Filtering to single-college courses reduces attribution ambiguity in college comparisons. It does not remove participation bias (for example, different colleges may post on Reddit at different rates). All results are interpreted as patterns within this frozen Reddit snapshot.
