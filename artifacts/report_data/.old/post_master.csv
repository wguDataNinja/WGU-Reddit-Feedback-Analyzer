So can anyone confirm that the D334 OA has the whiteboard on the right side of the screen that I can use to make my info dump at the beginning of the test and use it for reference during the test?

I am practicing at work, dumping it all into notepad and checking for errors.  I have 5 classes left and 3 months to go, so I have plenty of time, not trying to rush it.  Working on memorizing and dumping this cheat sheet I found in some other posts.

But like I said, can anyone who has taken the OA recently confirm that the whiteboard is available?  It is during the PA.

I ran through the lab. The instructions were very well drafted and I followed them. I have my screenshots.

Question #1: There's a FW policy that allows incoming traffic on this particular port. Am I to delete this FW rule and inject the one the instructions tell me to? See screenshot:  
The first line is my input. But the two other lines were already there.

https://preview.redd.it/y7ppdz7sfgve1.jpg?width=1588&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad6bdbfcfb944e026d09011e427644199349d4f1

Question #2 When the instructions tell you to open task manager and right click on the offending EXE. Select ""Search Online"" and ""open file location"". Am I supposed to do anything with these? Like is there other steps I must take to ""remediate"" because I completed all the steps and the threat is gone but the EXE is still eating up 99% CPU usage. When I search the web, MS says Defender removes the threat. I re-ran the scan and it is not reporting, yet the offending EXE is still there. There is a sub-process I identified and it doesn't show in Add/Remove Programs. Am I expected to uninstall this subprocess? There's also Registry Keys associated with the main EXE and sub-process. I COULD delete them. but am I expected to delete and note it in my paper under the remediation section? I have uninstalled the offending application but it keeps coming back.

Question #3 ""additional notes and observations"" for both Investigate and remediate, what exactly am I supposed to be putting in here? I guess I could put the above additional sub-process in the investigate portion. But for the remediation? I guess if I do actually perform the removal of the EXE and sub-process that would go here? Or am I missing the whole point?

Any assistance is greatly appreciated.

1jabnim,35m63,WGUIT,Passed AWS CCP(D282),"Title. Despised studying and subsequently taking this test. Wasn’t terribly difficult but I found myself annoyed with studying for it.

I studied for a little under 2 weeks for it, maybe 11 days to be exact at 4 hours a day.

I used https://wgu.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-exams-c/learn/quiz/4555462 (Neal Davis CCP practice test) to see where I was at. Very informative and the questions are on par with how the test questions are written.

I used https://youtu.be/JsmhEgIV1mQ?si=HY5PTicBOz-T6QKu as my primary (and only) repository of information. He does an alright job of explaining the services but I would highly recommend using a different resource. I made this mistake and walked into the Neal Davis test failing most if not all of the first 4 (of 6). 

Before sitting for the exam I was averaging between 65-74 on the Neal Davis test. I ran through each test at least twice over the 11 day time period. As of right now I don’t know my exact score.

The morning of the test I went through 2 30-40 flash card quizlets. I just googled aws CCP quizlets and used the first 2 that popped up.

I just completed my second course, D619, Global Health, and it took me 7 days, including two evaluations. 

This course included 1 paper. Mine was 9 pages, or 12 including the reference list and cover page. 
I had to resubmit after initial evaluation due to incorrect in-text citations. If your source has more than 2 authors, you must put the first last name, followed by “et al.”
– Example: (Souza et al., 2024)

Tips -

 You will NEED to use the attachment at the bottom of the page for your chosen scenario. I almost missed these and I was very confused about how to start. You are NOT making up an organization. You are writing the advocacy statement as a specific organization and the file at the bottom of the page, under “SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS” (past the rubric) will give you the essential information needed to answer many of the questions. 

You can also view examples at the very bottom of the page under “WEB LINKS”

Use APA formatting for each paper, especially for the references page and in-text citation.

I wrote each paper in the format of a response after a number
Example:
1. Blah blah blah
2. Blah blah blah

Use the requirements as an outline/template but erase the actual questions and just leave the numbers, otherwise it may be flagged for having a high percentage of “unoriginal work”.

Read questions carefully, but if you’re wanting to accelerate, just go for it. If it’s wrong, you’ll have the chance to correct it.",1737401933,7,1.0,,text,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_Accelerators/comments/1i5yw8t/mph_global_health_d619/,/r/WGU_Accelerators/comments/1i5yw8t/mph_global_health_d619/,['D619'],D619,1,-0.4767,0,0,0.0,,,"Required supporting document(s) for the assignment are hard to find (located below the rubric/supporting materials), which caused confusion about how to start the assignment.","[You will NEED to use the attachment at the bottom of the page for your chosen scenario.

\*\* Note: This is what I find on my test version, I heard there are multiple versions of the test. \*\*

**Best Material:**  
**- Book provided by WGU. - Get familiar with those diagrams**  
**- Review Questions provided by CI is helpful if you can't answer them, study it till you knows it**

My study method was to follow the study guide provided by the instructor to a T.  I followed the WGU coursework, after which I did the flashcards provided on quizlet in the way it recommended on the study guide.  After completing all 7 sections of the coursework and going through all the flash cards (over 1000 flash cards!) I took the PA.  I would slightly recommend doing the PA first even though it said not to in the study guide.

I passed the PA ON THE LINE.  One more question wrong would've not passed it, so I decided I needed to study more.  I went through the areas I was weakest on and reread them in the book.  I found PDF copies of the book and uploaded them to ChatGPT and had it aid me in studying making sure I locked down understanding of all the concepts.

1ftiqcp,35m63,WGUIT,I can't Sleep....,"I have had a pretty rough time of getting thru all my classes. My first term I did well then the steam roller got slower and slower and with quite a bit of other things going on in my life chugged to nearly a halt. After several terms of very little progress I was finally looking toward the end. As of about 2 weeks ago I had to finish up my Capstone and had one lingering class left. C777.

Got my capstone in and was left with C777. I only had about 8 days of study before my term ended. Last day of my term was Sep30th. So I crammed and crammed the last week and several days ago scheduled my OA at 11:40pm Sept 30th. I know I was cutting it close but wanted time to study all day and then take the exam.

At 11:40pm on the dot after the timer ran down I was given access to take the test button. I pressed it and.....GOT an ERROR!!! The button disappeared and was unable to get into the Queue for the exam. I started to panic and IMMEDIATELY opened up a text chat. Long story short I had to wait roughly an hour before they could get me into the exam.

So even though I had my test scheduled to start before the term ended at 11:40pm eastern time It didn't actually start till closer to 1am Oct1st. Worst part about it with the end of the month and term switch over I no longer have access to the course or degree page and have no way to even see if I passed the OA or not!!!

I'm on pins and needles and can't sleep not knowing if I passed the last class or failed, and I am concerned if since my test didn't actually start though no fault of my own at 1am OCT 1st if my transcripts will show an incomplete and I will be rolled into a new term or if they will correct the issue.

Not sure what to do at this point, I'm wired right now not knowing if I'm finished FINALLY and who I'm going to have to get ahold of to see how it all affects my terms. I've emailed my mentor and assessment services but it will be hours and hours before I hear anything back at all. I'm so frustrated right now and can't sleep.  

EDIT passed now will have to see how they handle the dates

I realize that I messed up the positional awareness technique—that's on me. But do we have to do what we said in Task 1?

It all fits on one page just fine. So, should I just add another secondary nav element? Or follow the comments from the evaluator? 

I'm a little butthurt because I did the project in HTML and was pretty proud of it, but if I have to add that side menu bar because I talked about it in Task 1, I might have to start from scratch.

Step 1. Take PA- See how smart or dumb you are.

Step 2. Look at your sections where you are dumb.

Step 3. Use this to study because they're very similar to the actual exam:

[D337 - Internet Of Things and Infrastructure Flashcards | Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/885143305/d337-internet-of-things-and-infrastructure-flash-cards/)

Step 4. Pass the OA



To be clear, I did not read any of the book, study any of the notes, watch any videos or try very hard. I personally do not think this class was very hard.



One last tip for you peeps. The OA will sometimes ask a question then later give you the answer in another question. Remember you have long time, me thinks 1.5-2 hours. I passed in 29 minutes.

18ddidg,35m63,WGUIT,Passed Business of IT – Applications - D336 - ITIL v4 Foundation (GONE WRONG)," 

Studying for the ITIL v4 certification was like navigating a dense jungle of jargon, a thicket of words that seemed designed to obfuscate rather than illuminate. Each sentence was laden with corporate buzzwords, strung together in what felt like a tangled web of confusion. The actual information hidden within this linguistic chaos was akin to buried treasure in a minefield.

I embarked on this treacherous journey armed with determination and a dogged will to conquer this bureaucratic beast. But the path was riddled with frustration. The sheer volume of impenetrable terminology threatened to sink my spirits. It was a war of attrition against words that seemed to speak a language of their own, a coded dialect reserved for the initiated few.

And then came the day of reckoning, the exam itself. A Kafkaesque ordeal awaited me in the form of proctoring requirements that defied the laws of physics. The proctors, guardians of the digital realm, demanded the impossible. **They wanted eyes on my front door and hallway simultaneously, a logistical riddle wrapped in absurdity.**

I found myself embroiled in a surreal battle with the proctors, defending the impossibility of complying with their outrageous demands. How does one keep an eye on two different spaces separated by walls? The laws of physics scoffed at this request, yet the proctors seemed steadfast in their folly.

It was a chaotic scene, a clash between the bureaucratic whimsy of the digital overseers and the practical realities of existence. They threatened to cancel my test, hanging the sword of Damocles over my head for failing to achieve the unachievable.

In the end, amidst this whirlwind of nonsensical obstacles, I emerged victorious. I navigated the maze of words, survived the absurdity of proctoring, and emerged on the other side with the coveted ITIL v4 certification in hand. But the scars of this gonzo adventure remain—a testament to the surreal circus that was my journey through the world of ITIL v4

13t1ar6,13mzkb,WGUTeachersCollege,D904 will be the DEATH of me…and my career.,"I posted here a while ago looking for some advice for my D094 class (Educational Psychology and Development of Children Adolescents) and I first want to say thank you to everyone who commented with advice and tips. They helped a lot and though I did fail a second time, the report showed that I improved in a handful of places. My second OA went horrible however and the moment I sat down I felt things were going to go badly.

My protector was extremely nitpicking, much more than the others I’ve had in my other classes and my first attempt. She spent the first fifteen minutes complaining to me about the random kleenex box on the desk that I couldn’t touch if I reached for it (and other things 🙄) I know it’s their job but how can anyone cheat with a kleenex box? I would really like to know. After that, it went downhill. I was flustered with her constant bickering of random things and she interrupted me a few times during the test. I was out of focus majority of the time, but that was probably more my fault than hers.

Anyways, my question right now is what happens moving forward? I feel i’m never going to get through this course. I wish they gave us an option, assign me some paper I’ll ace that and write it in a day. But what the hell can I do? I’m ready to give up, I’m exhausted with it. I’ve never studied so much, not even when I was in school. I also have a gripe that wether pass or fail of the OA, you aren’t allowed to see what you got right and wrong. I understand for cheating purposes but I’d like to at least know if I got certain questions correct. Telling me I did good on the 32% of one subject but failed at another 32% doesn’t help me one bit. Did i fail that percent completely? Did i miss by one? 

The study plan that my instructor assigned me for the second fail is literally the same as the first with a few things added. Maybe it’s me but I can’t learn that way, I need to learn what I did good on and what I did wrong, making me do 10 modules of the same thing makes me not want to do it.

I appreciate the kind words and everything from everyone but I would really like to know if I have any other options, cause I’m about to throw in the towel.",1685173698,4,0.84,,text,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUTeachersCollege/comments/13t1ar6/d904_will_be_the_death_of_meand_my_career/,/r/WGUTeachersCollege/comments/13t1ar6/d904_will_be_the_death_of_meand_my_career/,['D904'],D904,1,-0.9809,0,0,0.0,,2025-04-24 06:48:24,"Proctor behavior (nitpicking and interruptions) during the OA created a distracting, stressful testing environment that likely affected performance and is a fixable evaluator/proctor conduct issue.",My protector was extremely nitpicking...

1ggb2xi,bqpnvv,WGU_Accelerators,D333 - Help with Ethics in Tech practice exam questions clarification,"Hi, I was hoping that someone could help me clarify the first couple of questions from the practice exam. I am a bit confused, I think I understand the answers but not 100% sure.

In the first question, the scenario is about a company trying to poach a manager from a competitor. They want to offer her a VP position as long as she can bring a list of the competitor's clients. The manager has a non-compete contract with the competitor company. The correct answer is ""unethical and illegal""

The second question scenario is about an analyst working at a company and he was approved to find a part time job at another company. The second company is asking the analyst about some project he worked (but not require / mandatory that he answer, unlike question 1). The analyst is under an NDA so he cannot disclose anything. The correct answer here is ""unethical and legal"".

For Q1: would it be unethical and illegal because the company is coercing the manager to reveal confidential information in order to get the job she wanted (VP)? It's unethical because they know she has a noncompete and are asking for confidential info

For Q2: It's unethical because they ask about confidential info (thus putting the analyst in an bad position) but legal because they don't force him or threaten to fire him if he does not give up the answers?",1730369749,3,1.0,,text,2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_Accelerators/comments/1ggb2xi/d333_help_with_ethics_in_tech_practice_exam/,/r/WGU_Accelerators/comments/1ggb2xi/d333_help_with_ethics_in_tech_practice_exam/,['D333'],D333,1,-0.9911000000000001,0,0,0.0,,2025-04-24 06:48:32,,,0,,,,,,,Ethics in Technology,School of Business; School of Technology,Ethics in Technology

Even an instructor thought it was weird how I passed the more advanced stuff with flying colors but got almost no competency with simple “select” queries that’s just bs

Wtf that’s an empty space, I’ve never seen an error like this. I spent 10 mins looking at my answer and couldn’t figure out what was wrong. Then after I confirmed I had it right the whole time. Instructors are no help here either, now I have to waste time “studying” my weak points

1gjet2a,gsr7a,WGU_CompSci, From SQL Whiz to Humble Student: My Epic Journey Through WGU’s D427 Course,"Hey fellow data nerds and WGU warriors! 🎮🐍

Picture this: There I was, a hotshot data engineer at a AAA gaming company, slinging SQL and Python like a boss. ETL pipelines? Pfft, I eat those for breakfast. PostgreSQL? My middle name. So when I started this WGU database course, I thought I’d breeze through it faster than a speedrunner on Red Bull.

Boy, was I in for a plot twist! 😅


Act I: The Overconfident Hero
	•	Studied for a day (because, you know, I’m awesome)
	•	Crushed the PA with an 88% (cue victory dance)
	•	Thought to myself, “I’ve got this in the bag!”
Act II: The Fall
	•	Took the OA the next day
	•	Scored a measly 76% (cue sad trombone)
	•	Ego: shattered. Confidence: crushed.

Act III: The Epic Comeback
	•	Entered full grind mode (like trying to hit 100% completion on a tough RPG)
	•	Met with the instructor (shoutout to the real MVP!)
	•	Discovered the secret weapon: instructor’s personal Quizlet study guide
	•	Spent two days leveling up my vocab skills
	•	Unlocked a new skill tree: Completed a MySQL course on Udemy, focusing on syntax
	•	Battled my final boss: Mastering primary and foreign keys
	•	Grinded the practice OA like it was a raid boss - 7 more times until I felt 1000% ready

The Boss Battle:
Armed with my newfound knowledge, a slightly bruised ego, and more practice runs than a speedrunner, I faced the OA again. And guess what? I didn’t just pass - I CRUSHED IT! 🎉🎉🎉 Exemplary performance in every category, baby! It’s like I found all the cheat codes and used them at once!
Moral of the story:
	1.	Don’t get cocky, kid. Even if you’re a pro, there’s always more to learn.
	2.	Failure is just a checkpoint. Respawn and try again!
	3.	Use all the resources at your disposal. That Quizlet guide and Udemy course were like finding rare legendary items.
	4.	Practice, practice, practice! Those 7 extra OA runs were my training montage.
	5.	Sometimes, you need to zoom in on your weak spots. For me, it was those pesky primary and foreign keys.
To all my fellow WGU night owls out there: Keep pushing, keep grinding, and remember – every boss can be beaten with the right strategy, a lot of perseverance, and enough practice runs to make your fingers sore!
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have some databases to conquer and some primary keys to forge.

1fgqxpt,gsr7a,WGU_CompSci,C952 - Structured Vocabulary List with Definitions,"The course notes provide a very long list of vocabulary terms to know for the OA. In the interest of saving time, I used an AI Model (Claude) to organize this list into a hierarchical structure and generate the definitions. These definitions will not directly match those used in the textbook, but it should be sufficient for a broad understanding.

I will try to generate a more thoroughly defined list to expand on this one, but this one seems ideal for studying the high volume of terms.

Added new application properties file.

Added config package and copied RestDataConfig into config package folder. The name is correct. “import edu.wgu.d288\_backend.entities.\*” to “import com.example.demo.entities.\*”

I have my original project on the IDE of my actual desktop so I can review my old code but I am retyping it to make sure it's correct.

I also added code from the javabits video into restdataconfig but I don't know what her other fixes were. The import name is correct.

EDIT: Panopto is now back up!

""I have an error on my new and old version of the project: ""ERROR: Failed to retrieve application beans snapshot:: application=\*"""" This error also occurred in my advanced java project so I ignore it now. I would try not to fix the template code as I have wasted time on this before.

The main issue was resolved by copying the professors country example. Fixing my enum name. And ensuring each file matches the typescript ts files which is a PITA and should definitely be fixed.

In case it's been a while since you've taken the course or you need a quick refresher on what part H is all about:

H.  Add validation for between or at the maximum and minimum fields. The validation must include the following:

* Display error messages for low inventory when adding and updating parts if the inventory is less than the minimum number of parts.
* **Display error messages for low inventory when adding and updating products lowers the part inventory below the minimum.**
* Display error messages when adding and updating parts if the inventory is greater than the maximum.

I am stuck on this part because nowhere before this section did the course say we need to have the products and parts associated. Ultimately, I really have one question:

1aiom4o,gsr7a,WGU_CompSci,D288 Question: Fields Not Populating,"I made an appointment with a CI, but it won't be for several days and I'm not super sure it's going to be…helpful. So! Basic gist is, I've got most of my app working; the customers table is populated, the order tracking number is showing, aaaand…almost nothing else. I have images, I can add things to my cart and checkout, but it just doesn't actually work because no data is being passed. The price field of the vacations is blank, customer information is blank…and the only errors being thrown is in the console for the main.ts and numbers are being passed as NaN. It's hard to describe, I haven't found anyone asking a question about this so far, just the order tracking number issues.

Example, /customers: The customers table is populated correctly with all fields filled (John Doe + 5 tests). The page has six blank boxes with no info in them. My console is throwing several errors relating to the main.ts and core.mjs. There are no errors in IntelliJ.

And it basically does that for every page. The only thing I can get to show is the order tracking number at the checkout purchase page, which required me to disable saving cart, cartItems, and customer (all three, I checked) to their repositories, so I'm pretty sure that's also not actually working and I've well and truly messed up somewhere. None of the other tables populate at any point, but it's not throwing any other errors, so I don't know where in my code I need to be looking. Nothing stands out to me.

Could this be just a mapping issue and I should redo all of my entities? That was my first thought, but they all look accurate to the examples in material and other students that have had mapping issues. Or did I actually manage to break something important and need to just start over? If anybody has an idea of where this problem might have started, I would be so very grateful for being pointed in the right direction!",1707055509,2,1.0,D288 Back-End Programming,text,3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1aiom4o/d288_question_fields_not_populating/,/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1aiom4o/d288_question_fields_not_populating/,['D288'],D288,1,-0.5953,0,0,0.0,,2025-04-24 06:49:23,,,0,,,,,,,Back-End Programming,School of Technology,Back-End Programming

19fctbx,gsr7a,WGU_CompSci,Do NOT take the online exam for Linux D281,"I’ve seen quite a few other complaints in here but chose to take the online exam anyways out of convenience. The experience was terrible from start to finish. My test was scheduled for 6pm. I checked in 30 minutes early as they suggested. I wasn’t paired with a proctor until 6:45ish. After connecting with the proctor he immediately asked me to close the software and reopen it bc there were some technical difficulties. I asked “are you sure? Will I have to wait again” he assured me I would reconnect with him as soon as I re-joined. So I did what he asked. Once I reopened the software, it said I was next in line to be greeted by a proctor. About 20 minutes go by with nothing then all of a sudden it put me to the back of the queue. I didn’t end up taking my test until about 8:30pm. 2 and a half hours after my scheduled appointment. The 2nd proctor was also very rude and had an attitude the moment I was paired with her.

1jhn092,2oek38,WGU_MBA,C215 OA Difficulty,"Hi. I’ve passed the PA 2 times. Both were probably by about 2-3 questions. It appears you only need to get a 68% on the exam or higher from what I have read and seen. So about 22 questions can be wrong and you still pass. 

Has anyone taken this recently and how was it? I’ve seen a lot about the application of the questions as opposed to definitions. I am taking tomorrow.

1e93oh1,2oek38,WGU_MBA,ProctorUgh,"I took my first OA last night with ProctorU.  I have never been more frustrated.  

Keep in mind that I received my BS from WGU as well, so I'm quite familiar with proctoring.  

Why did I have to take pics of my ID and all of my surroundings just to have to redo it live?  One may never know, but that's not what is frustrating.

I had already unplugged, covered, and moved my second monitor behind my first monitor.  Phone was upstairs.  Clear bottle of water on my desk. Calculator and clean whiteboard present along with whiteboard pen and eraser.  

First, the proctor became angrier and angrier that I would not show them where my phone was.  We  were speaking, but thinking there was a language barrier, I typed it in the chat.  She would NOT accept my phone was on another floor.  I just finally told her I didn't own one and to move on.  

Then, she wanted me to unplug my laptop and remove it from my desk.  We had a full 6 minute conversation as to why that wasn't possible, both verbally and in chat.  At one point she told me to disconnect my monitor and just use my laptop.  My monitors are 24 inch television screens.  No way my tired, old eyes were going to focus on a small laptop screen at 10pm.  When she found out my keyboard, not needed for the C213 exam, was in my ergonomical desk drawer, she lost her shit.  

All of this before my scheduled 9:30 pm exam even started, and we were half an hour in so far. I finally opened up a desk drawer, took out a pen and post-it, and wrote down her name.  I held it to the  camera and asked her if it was spelled correctly, because I was going to leave a bad survey and make a complaint.  I was finally able to begin my exam nearly 40 minutes after the scheduled time, and it took two of the three allotted hours.  

Good news is that I began my MBA program on July 1st, and I am five classes down and working on six.  Bad news is that I'm afraid I'm going to have to fill my water bottle with other clear liquids if ProctorU doesn't get their shit together.  Like nearly all of us, I am in a full-time+ career and have a family--four college kids and two in elementary.  I literally don't have time for this  nonsense.

1bdg29w,2oek38,WGU_MBA,Just passed C214 OA,"FWIW, I used the following method to pass C214 OA with exemplary rating.  I probably could have saved a week if I knew exactly how to approach the preparation from day 1 but oh well.  Let me just say that by far this was the most stressful and tough OA yet in the program. I absolutely hated how some calculation problems have you jumping through a few steps to arrive at the answer.

Note that I did not read the e-text at all as most everyone said it didn't help at all and only wasted time. For the webinar videos off panopto, make sure you watch each at least 3 times.  take notes on concepts and calculation method for different types of problems each time  you watch the video.  Follow along and practice using the BA II Plus calculator so you're familiar with the order of key presses - this is especially important for IRR/NPV problems.  On the 2nd watch and on I play at 1.25x speed to save a bit of time (1.5x was too fast).

1. Ray's bootcamp video helped me the most but I didn't know/watch it until a couple days before the OA.  You can find it under C214 course right side > course tips pop-up > course resources > C214 - Ray's 58 MINUTE Calculation Video

1az03au,2oek38,WGU_MBA,Question on Pre-Assessment ,"I start the WGU MBA program March 1st. I’ve been reading various posts about how to optimize the program but had a question on pre-assessment tests. 

I had my first meeting with my assigned mentor last week. It went well. Things seemed good. 

Then I emailed him a question about taking a pre-assessment before I even started a class (as it looked like I could do that with C202). 

He stated that I should not take a pre-assessment until I have gone through ALL the course material as it undermines the value of the program. 

So my question to the Reddit community:

When do you take a pre-assessment? 
What is the effect of failing it? Taking it at the start of the class? Taking it before a class even starts?

It seems a bit hard to accelerate if you don’t take the pre-assessment until you have gone through all the course material but maybe I’m just misunderstanding. 

Also, if I disregard my mentors direction and take the pre-assement within the first few days of starting a course, will that have any negative consequences or issues with my mentor?

One thing that has always annoyed me about WGU is that a person can do so well on the Pre-Assessment and fail horribly on the Objective Assessment. I went through 1000 questions on Quizlet and still failed. Then both the student mentor and the course mentor reached out and informed me that as punishment for not passing on the first try, I have to read the entire book, re-take the PA, and pass all the chapter quizzes with at least an 80%. Both in my undergrad and now in this grad program, many WGU students and course mentors have the worst 'Bedside manners' in dealing with students. What is so hard with reaching out and saying something like, 'Hey we noticed you didn't pass the OA, how can we help? What were your sticking points?....' This is especially true when they know full well this is one of the most difficult courses for students with no accounting background.

1g7mef1,650w59,WGU_MSDA,D600 GitLab question,"So I've written the entire linear regression in Jupyter Notebook for task 1-- no problem, pretty easy project. I set up the pipeline and cloned the project on GitLab as instructed. Then I uploaded my Jupyter file and I've hit a snag.

The rubric says for parts C2 through D4 you have to commit with a message and push changes to GitLab for EACH part. How does this work if I've written the entire thing in Jupyter (which the course instructor says is the right way to do it in the ""course tips"") and imported the whole file?

My problem here is that in GitLab, you can show a rendered view of the Jupyter file that looks clean and nice. But when you go to edit the file (in the edit feature or the web IDE), the code is (I think) a complicated json with a few thousand lines. Basically, I can't edit, commit, message, or push individual bits of code because the file is so long and incomprehensible in any space where it's possible to edit.

Any ideas or thoughts? Am I thinking about this wrong? How do I push individual parts of a large project when I can't read the code when I go to edit? Because as far as I can tell, the edit feature is where make comments and commit the changes.

I've taken two or three other classes already that needed me to use Git before and I always end up spending a lot of time just trying to get it usable, in which case I usually google for hours and find workarounds or things way beyond what the Gitlab How-To page says. 

I spent all yesterday and this evening just trying to figure it out. I've redone the same steps over and over, I know maybe my VS code is connected to some other repository somehow, I also keep getting the same error no matter what that I can't commit to 'main' branch, even though I properly did the pipeline and cloned. I know i'm not trying to commit to the 'main' branch, but my own. Also when I look at my Student Repo it says 'forked from an inaccessible project', does that mean anything? 

Honestly, if someone can just tell me if what I did sounds right or wrong i'd appreciate it. I know I could email my course instructor who will probably send me the link to the Gitlab how-to or reccomend help desk, but I know sometimes people here run into the same issues.

I don't want to say it was easy because it didn't feel easy, but I will say it was identical to the practice tests I took on Udemy. Honestly, I did not expect to pass. I struggled with some of the questions and I was thinking ""just tell me already that I failed"". I almost cried when I saw PASS on the screen.

I used a little of everything. YouTube, Udemy, AWS Skill Builder course. I can't tell you which was the best. I'm just relieved I'm done with it. My semester ends this month and I finished all my credits, so now, I can do my favorite thing: absolutely nothing! XD

Problem #2 Evaluation: Once the site was hosted I submitted again and the way my file structure was the evaluation team sent back again because the file path for css wasn’t exactly the same as the hosted version. Which was indeed my fault, although the site looked exactly the same between the hosted site and source code.

Problem #3: After fixing and quadruple checking as well as having CI look it over it was just sent back again for revision because the evaluators are trying to grade a previous submission!

18id5yn,39m4n,wgu_devs,"D282 - Passed, my take","Hey all, took the exam last night, finished it in exactly 21 minutes and today got the score report, I scored 806. Although, CCP has a lot of new terms, in quite honesty the exam is very straightforward compared to the practice exams, no tricky words. You just need to pay attention to what’s being asked and choose the right answer accordingly, on very few questions I had a doubt if the answer could be one or the other. It did take me 4 weeks as I messed up the scheduling twice, and had to cancel the appointment. So, just a heads up, you can only reschedule twice, after that you need to cancel and wait for the refund, which can take 7-10 days. I was waiting for the refund until I told assessment services to just mark my first attempt as no show and give me the second attempt with the approval of my instructor who promptly approved. Otherwise, in 2-3 weeks it’s doable to get this done, English is not my first language and I’m not the best learner, so I really need to spend extra time to get myself to study too lol

In my opinion, use the AWS Skills Builder Cloud Foundation videos, they supplement the material with the examples of a cafe, which make you understand a lot better how the services work, it really did stick with me. 
I Initially used Neal Davis’s videos and spent a week on it, but very few concepts sticked with me so I instead relied on AWS Skills Builder and skipped the last  5-6 sections of Neal’s course.
I used Stephane Marek’s practice exams, I was scoring 40% maximum 60%. I was paranoid so I also supplemented my study with Jon Bonso’s practice exams. I was scoring between 70%-75%, got 81% only on the 4th practice exam after 2-3 attempts.
I have about 4 years and half of experience in IT, and I also hold the AZ-104 certificate, some of the knowledge was transferrable but mostly, lots of new terms and features to get to know.

186ysa1,39m4n,wgu_devs,I passed D335! (Introduction to Programming in Python),"I had some past exposure to Python but no real programming experience to speak of. I did the zyBooks course without the optional chapters on classes, recursion, etc. If I'd had time, I would have done those chapters, as I'm sure they would have been informative. I DID do the optional lab chapters. I strongly, strongly recommend the two practice test chapters. 

I took the PA several times for practice. The OA I took has many similarities to it (I don't know if the OA varies from person to person.) 

There were two long, difficult problems in chapter 28 - one was about a soccer roster, the other about credit card debt. There wasn't anything approaching those on the OA. The trickiest things I recall were the two questions about file operations, and that's just because I couldn't recall the precise syntax needed for them. 

I didn't use any outside resources for the course. I completed it in 2-3 weeks. I've already used what I learned at work, too.

I am looking for some help with my project for Software One in C#. I have the GUI mostly completed, and can populate some fake data, but I'm having a wild problem. I can only call methods from my Inventory class in my main form. When I try in any of the other forms (add, modify) for both parts and products, the Inventory class throws an error (CS1061). Has anybody else run into this?

&#x200B;

Link to (spaghetti) code: [Said wild Inventory Class + Repo](https://github.com/Duncan-Lester/GUIInventTry4/blob/master/GUIInventTry4/Inventory.cs). This project is really becoming a road block for me.

Things I've checked:

* Inventory and AddPartForm/AddProductForm share the same namespace
* The addProduct() method is public static void
* my BindingList <junk> declarations are in Inventory, and then bound to the DataGridView in Main\_Form
* My Visual Studio app is updated (reinstalled).

would appreciate any sage advice from my elders, tearing my hair out over my Inventory that slightly exists? and can only be called sometimes.

It's an EOQ problem specifically for goat cheese. The daily demand for it is 22 so 22\*365=8030. The cost per order says it's $2 per order. The holding cost is .5% of the price per pound I believe, which is $7.10.

So EOQ = sqrt \[ 2(8030)(2)   /   .005(7.1) \] = sqrt \[ 32120 / .04 \] = sqrt \[ 803000 \] = 896.10.

896.1 is nowhere close to any of the option listed so I random guessed.

1izbrz5,3g1kl,wguaccounting,D101 - Help with equivalent units,"This equivalent unit module is seriously messing with my head. I've tried to understand it with the help of chatGPT, but it made me more confused.

Can someone help explain this problem to me?

I'm mainly confused on the beginning work-in-process section. My understanding is beginning work-in-process is some leftover work from previous period. So, if we have 8,000 units, direct materials is 0% done so we still need to complete 8,000 units. Similarly, conversion cost is 80% done (6400 units), so we still need to complete 20% (1600 units). What exactly do the direct materials cost ($1600) and conversion cost ($2400) represent? Is it the cost of completing the remaining 8000 and 1600 units respectively, or was it the cost of the 0 and 6400 equivalent units? ChatGPT says it's the cost of what was already completed, so $2400 was the cost of completing 6400 units, so the remaining 1600 units would be multiplied by $1.45 to get 2320. It says $1.45 x 6400 is wrong for the cost transferred out. This kinda makes more sense because why are we using current period conversion cost per unit to multiply by the units already completed?

I got Tasks 2 and 3 of D601 submitted Tuesday afternoon (3pm and 5pm respectively). The evaluators took the entire 72 hours, minus 40 minutes, to get evaluations done on both of them. Task 2 passed, great, mini celebration. Holding my breath for Task 3 to come back without any issues.

Task 3 came back needing revisions but the evaluator gave no usable feedback and locked the PA submission down until I meet with a professor. It's EOD Friday (at least for me, I'm on EDT) with 5 days left to go. I emailed my assigned professor and CC'd the instructor group, but I'm so frustrated with this. We can say it's my fault for getting two assignments submitted with 8 days left to go in the term. Sure. I'll own that.

But I'm also a staff member at Florida State, which just had a deadly shooting a week ago Thursday. I've been working a marathon to install, activate, and configure every individual help request from every instructor necessary across a campus of 40 or 50,000 students get their final exams switched over to our third-party proctoring system so students can take their exams off campus because many of them don't feel safe returning. My sister's wedding is tomorrow. I'm mentally, emotionally, and physically drained and I can't even wrap my mind around celebrating tomorrow. It's always a disappointment to have a PA returned needing revisions. That's one thing. But to give me no feedback at all and then just say ""speak to your professor"" is an insult and incredibly deflating.

The only reason why this test is so hard is because there is just a lot of information to remember and to me all of it is new.

1kb7dja,2se63,WGU,Sat on D427 for over a year and FINALLY PASSED,"I got cold feet time and time again before taking this exam. There was just so much material, and I honestly didn't know where to start studying. My CI was great - she continuously followed up via email to check in and make sure I was using her study materials (I didn't use them, but probably should've to avoid all this delay). I just used the practice questions on Zybooks until I felt comfortable with the material, then finally told myself, ""might as well take the exam to see what's on it, if I fail - at least I'll know what to cover next time."" But I passed!!!

Moral of the story: please don't doubt yourself. I probably could've been done with this course months ago if I had just gotten over the fear of failure.

1kdhnm6,39m4n,wgu_devs,Passed D427 - Data Management Applications - My First Attempt! Please Read To Save Yourself!,"Guys, I did the OA for the new version of D427. I can tell you that OA accurately resembled the PA (Seriously). I thought I was doing the PA. Before I go into what I was asked and what you should study. Let me start off by telling you that was the most stupid exam I ever did in my life and WGU is my 3rd school so I’ve done a lot of exams. 

Firstly, one question asked me to create a view called MyMovie. I created the view, correct syntax, but when I ran it, there was a Zybooks error that said MyMovie didn’t exist even though the question explicitly asked me to create the view and call it “MyMovie”… I was confused and irritated. Didn’t know what to do but the previous question asked me to alter a view called “MyMovies”. Therefore, my mind randomly said why don’t you just add an s to MyMovie even though they didn’t ask for “MyMovies”, they explicitly asked you for “MyMovie”. I added an s and the error went away. That made no sense at all! The question asked me to create a view called “MyMovie” NOT “MyMovies”. 

Secondly, a question asked me to delete all movies released before the year 2000. I wrote code, it ran without errors but Zybooks has this button where you can run the code against test cases and it provides feedback.. the feedback said “FAIL: 5 movies still exist that were released before 2020”. When I say that I was so dumbfounded, the question asked me to delete movies released before 2000, not 2020.. so the question asked for 2000 but the test case tested the code against 2020 instead. LOL. Since I realized this, I changed 2000(even though that’s what the question asked) to 2020 and it finally worked and passed the test case. That was confusing. 

There were some other errors on the exam. 3-4 questions in total that I can’t remember. I wrote them down for the instructor but the proctor made me clear my whiteboard and I told her there was errors on the exam. I am so ready to report this shit so they can get it fixed because I almost failed and it wasn’t my fault. It seems the new version of the course is filled with errors!!! 

Anyway, WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO PASS: 

For writing SQL code:

1. How to create a table(know datatypes), how to insert into a table, how to delete a row from a table. 
2. How to alter a table, column. 
3. How to drop a view, how create a view, how to alter an already existing view. 
4. How to do JOINS. My question asked me to create a RIGHT JOIN. Doesn’t seem I got it correct because Zybooks said my syntax was wrong. (It was not, there’s literally a reference sheet in the exam that shows you how to write the syntax). 
5. How to use MAX(), SUM(). 
6. How to use order by, group by. 

For multiple choice: 
1. Know how to identify attributes, know cardinality, know how joins work. 

To conclude, I’ve read all the horrors about this course on here. Therefore, I was scared to take the OA. Very scared. Finally gave it a shot and passed. If you can pass the PA, do Practice Test 1,2,3 on your own. Then you will pass. Don’t overthink it, but Zybooks may set you up to fail.

1ke2mfm,35m63,WGUIT,Just had the worst testing experience D427 OA,"Title. This pertains to the new version of D427 that was implemented on 5/1/2025. I had previously read that some people noticed some pretty bad errors such as the screen freezing and you're unable to put anymore inputs in.

Well I had the same experience. I got to question 21 of 25 using the WGU browser ( I can't say it by name) and I could not submit any queries or go back to the previous question or go to the next question. I alerted the proctor and told him to look at what's going on. He took control of my mouse and noticed the same errors. He then opened Chrome (I didn't ask him to) and re-opened the test using Chrome. I was able to get through the test up to question 24 before the test froze again. Again, I alerted the instructor. He took control and noted the same thing, again. Instead of attempting to resolve the issue or reach out to someone, he asked me to wait patiently. 10 minutes go by, I ask for an update. He, again, tells me to wait, Another 20 minutes go by, I demand an update because we're pushing hour 2 of my allotted exam time. He ask me to wait. I start clicking a bunch of buttons in the settings portion of the zybooks test, causing him to ask me if the test works again. I replied with no. He attempts to open up a different webpage on chrome and have me input all the answers a third time, to which I stop him and demand that the issue be resolved or that I needed to speak to a supervisor. His only reply was take it up with WGU.

I go back and forth a few more times with him because I'm hot. Eventually he just tells me to close the browser and figure it out. Miraculously, I was able to reschedule the test but i'll probably end up rescheduling it again. I'm still in the midst of drafting up a scathing email to my instructor and mentor.

**With that being said, I highly encourage anyone that is taking this class to wait a little bit for them to fix all of the bugs inside of it. They already had a ton of complaints by the second day the course was live because people kept encountering errors when they were attempting to schedule the test.**",1746304835,7,0.9,,text,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUIT/comments/1ke2mfm/just_had_the_worst_testing_experience_d427_oa/,/r/WGUIT/comments/1ke2mfm/just_had_the_worst_testing_experience_d427_oa/,['D427'],D427,1,-0.6609,0,0,0.0,,2025-05-05 07:44:49,"Platform/system malfunction: the D427 assessment (WGU/zyBooks browser) repeatedly froze and prevented submitting answers or navigating between questions, blocking progress and consuming allotted exam time.",I got to question 21 of 25 using the WGU browser ... and I could not submit any queries or go back to the previous question or go to the next question. ...

I know this, because the (correct) marked answer is the one I selected and a CI confirmed it with me in live time with a call.

I can’t help but imagine that the actual test has the same issue. I also noticed that the coding side of the exam is nuts too. Correct solutions marked wrong with zero explanation as to how it doesn’t work and the CI are essentially worthless because they do not give any answers or insights beyond, “ huh, that’s weird, you should’ve been marked correct for that one…” That is a quote from another call where we stepped through the pre-assessment so they could see what I was seeing.

Has anyone else seen issues with this course or the assessments? I’m taken aback that my +5 years of professional Python isn’t enough to get through this stupid course, but this is ZyBooks and Meazure Learning we’re talking about.

1kogwbc,2se63,WGU,D102 - Thanks Tony Bell,"4 days of watching Tony Bell videos and following along in his PDF workbook, half a day of taking the lesson/module/unit tests, and here I am. I actually find doing journal entries very fun. There are a couple of things here and there that don't make perfect sense, but I feel like I really have this on lock. I know Managerial Accounting will NOT come as easy to me, though. But I have now completed 6 classes in 16 days (some of those, no work was attempted), so I'm feeling the fire! I know I will probably slow down soon though. (I also really wanted Exemplary, and I know I probably only missed it by a question or two on each! Ugh!)

1kxvduo,2se63,WGU,"Can't get any instructors to approve me for a retake of the C777 OA, so looks like I'm failing it. (vent)","As the title said, I failed the C777 OA earlier this month by 3-4 questions. The instructor sent me a whole check list of things to do, I did all of them and finished last week. I posted previously about the ""to-do"" list because it was a generic, canned email with generic ""you did poorly in all the parts, this is how to get better"" when I was exemplary in more than one part of the OA. It appears to be the same email everyone who fails the OA gets, whether you fail by 1 question, or only get 1 question right.

I emailed the instructor last week, automated response of ""we'll get to your email in the order it was received"", waited until yesterday and emailed the whole instructor team, no response. Given the end of my term is in 3 days, I spoke to my mentor and they said I would probably fail the course but my average is good so I won't suffer any serious consequences for it. I'm just frustrated I spent so much time to go through the academic hazing for failing over 3-4 questions over the past 2 weeks just to sit and wait for the fail to happen.

Even if it is approved for a retake tomorrow or the next day, I doubt I will get a decent appointment time with a a proctor given my work schedule this week. It really makes me question the usefulness of the instructors at WGU and the communication guidelines for time sensitive issues like this. /vent

1kwrpfa,2se63,WGU,Passing C955 Applied Statistics as someone who fears math,"I hate math. I cheated/skipped through most of the math fundamentals in middle school/high school and was left with a poor understanding of any math concepts outside of basic functions and PEMDAS. I was dreading this class and spent double the amount of time on it than I have my other classes. This is how I did it:

-Watch the module videos listed in the supplemental resources section. I DID NOT watch the cohorts - those start on Mod 3. I watched the full list of videos that review each individual module, which are linked inside a PDF listed in the supplemental resources section.

-Within each video, the instructor breaks it down into module sections. When she finished a section, I would then go to the review/questions area of that section within MindEdge, and complete the problems. If I got to a problem I didnt understand, I'd find a problem that was similar in the video and rewatch that piece.

-At the end of the module video, I'd take at least one problem set within mindedge AND the module test. I did this for every module, even though the first two modules are not on the test.

-Took the PA. Repeated steps above (with new practice problem sets) for the areas I was lacking

-Took the OA. Passed higher than I ever expected. Cried a little. Moving on 🤣

Tips:

-I can't remember where I heard it, but there is a video in the course that mentions ""no one is BAD at math. They're only lacking practice"" and that mindset really helped me get over that initial lump of fear and get started in the course

-Take your time. If you need to go back through the video, do it. If you need more practice problems, do them. I have pages and pages of scratch paper with slope equation problems written all over it because I needed that much practice to ""get it"".

-I found the OA to be harder. The questions in the PA were more focused on the beginning of the section material, while the OA was more focused on the deeper/more complex details of the material. Definitely make sure you have a solid understanding of Module 7.

-LEARN YOUR CALCULATOR. It's embarrassing to admit, but I had no clue that you could plug in fractions as-is into a calculator. Get the exact calculator they recommend - $20 at target. This way, you can follow along with the instructor when she goes through the problem on the calculator. There's a whole section (in mod 2 I think) that goes through calculator tips.

-Buy your own whiteboard. No scratch paper on the OA and the whiteboard WGU sends is awful. When taking the OA, make sure you have your whiteboard eraser too, as I had to erase to make space during the test.

1kv3ce0,2se63,WGU,D522 - Notes after passing (from a hater),"Hello WGU students, 

This course almost made me quit, no kidding, I had to carry this course over a semester, I hated this class SO much. Passion cannot tell you how much I hated it. 

  
I follow by the words, go through the udemy here: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/one-week-python/](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/one-week-python/) if you feel like the Zybooks is unhelpful, believe me when I tell you this will get you through most of the coursework.  BUT ENSURE YOU DO THE LABS, I would go to the end of a chapter, expand the python ""test mode"" fullscreen and paste the labs into it. 

  
Go back to the zybooks, and read the chapter on file open methodologies and the module imports, as it's not covered in the Udemy course. 

  
Once done with that DO ALL THE LABS, at least try, reach out to your course instructor to explain the ones that you missed. 

  
Take the PA, as I take the PA i make notes on the items that I need help on, and go back and review those items. 

  
review and take the exam, I skipped a few of the coding questions altogether on the exam and still passed. 

  
if I can do it, you can too, Don't give up and keep climbing.

1kv77vc,3mggr,WGUCyberSecurity,D483 (CySA+) Passed,"Holy crap I just passed this exam. I was completely shocked that I passed. 

Ok so I’ve been in IT for a long time but not in the cybersecurity field. I’ve primarily worked and managed for the Help Desk (currently a HD manager). 

The test:

67 questions with 5 PBQs (no drag and drops just select the best options)

Took an hour and some change. Went back and did a quick review, made at least 1 change to my answer and then submitted because I was like I’m probably gonna fail.  

Honestly I don’t remember much of it. I practically brain dumped when I walked out because I was overwhelmed and in disbelief that I passed.

I did the following to prep:

Mike Chapple LinkedIn Learning Prep (watched at 1.5x speed)

CertMaster Learn for CySA+ (started doing the Practice questions first by Lessons. Reviewed whatever I got wrong the retook it and moved on to the next. Took the Final Assessment and scored 69% then first time. Reviewed whatever I got wrong then retook it 6 days later and scored a 90%. Did the PBQs until it got I got 100% on all of them. Finally, I did the Learning Plan to complete the whole course)

Pocket Prep CompTIA CySA+ (I did the Level Up Quiz portion primarily)

Jason Dion’s Complete Course/Practice Exams (2x speed - just to get through his content but still able to understand. I took each of his test twice and typically scored around mid 60’s the first time and then around low 90’s second time around)

Wiley Test Bank (Did the quizzes by domain first then did the final assessments twice. Same thing as Dion’s exams)

Total Seminar CySA+ Practice Exams on LinkedIn Learning (Same as above)

CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide (started it last week and only got to the end Chapter 6)

All of this took me pretty much 3 months because I work full time and I’m somewhat of a procrastinator. I tried to study as much as I can while at work because once I’m home, home life takes over and prior to today the last 5 months have been shitty. I lost my cousin to his battle with mental illness and my mom was diagnosed with multiple myeloma.

Good luck to whoever is going to take this course/exam. You got this!

1. Read through the unit’s study guide to familiarize with the material.
2. Worked through all quizzes for that unit
3. Info I was unfamiliar with or got wrong, I’d double back and read the corresponding section
4. Took the unit test
5. Repeat until I got through all of the units
6. Took the PA
7. Took the OA (but would have made sense to review the PA and dig into some of the material I felt insecure with)

1li2k4r,2se63,WGU,Business Ethics - C717 (Tips and Tricks) | Passed in 5 hours,"**Difficulty: 4/10**

**Tips:**

\-There are two versions of this class; you need to figure out which version you're taking first and foremost. I looked at other Reddit threads that were linking the wrong videos/templates for my class. 

\-The template for both [versions](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/C717BusinessEthics/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FC717BusinessEthics%2FShared%20Documents%2FC717%20Task%20Resources%2FC717%20v3%20Tasks%20%28EKP1%29&viewid=57eea0b6%2D9002%2D4ade%2Da4c5%2D73d9628ee0d3)[ ](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/C717BusinessEthics/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FC717BusinessEthics%2FShared%20Documents%2FC717%20Task%20Resources&viewid=57eea0b6%2D9002%2D4ade%2Da4c5%2D73d9628ee0d3)is a **MUST**. It makes this so much easier, and it also provides extra tips.

\-Just start writing, do not open that god awful book! If you need to know a definition, Google it

\-Just like any other PA, follow the rubric to the 

Task 1: 3.5 hours Task 2 1.5 hours

**Thoughts:**

Any course with a book will never be read by me, idk what's up with WGU, but the books are always awful. The module-based classes are always a lot better. Task 1 was so bloated, I did not enjoy it at all. How many times do I need to say the same thing a different way? The tips on the template asked me to go into way greater detail than the rubric did, maybe I misunderstood it, but that felt strange. Didn't learn a single thing in this class; it can be summed up by the famous filmmaker Spike Lee's movie title. 'Do The Right Thing'

I recently had an ""ah-ha moment"" and realized that I DO know what I am doing and began submitting ""bug reports"" for the Zybooks labs seeing that the output results have conflicting information to the instructions. 

After submitting several ""bug reports"" to Zybooks they reported back that the labs are 100% created by WGU instructors, the output resulting in errors are 100% controlled by WGU instructors.

I’m so incredibly annoyed rn. 

I hate this class with every fiber of my being. I’ve spent nearly 2 months on it and it just doesn’t get easier. Now I have to do a study plan for a 3rd attempt 😭

The second attempt felt way harder than the first and had a bunch of stuff I don’t remember seeing when studying + incredibly confusing question wording. 
I improved on the topics I wasn’t great with from the first attempt just to fall short with the topic I (thought I) was comfortable with on the second lmao. 

This class sucks so bad and I was so ready to be done with it just to see that stupid little red circle again. I went in so confident just to completely deflate the longer I sat staring at the questions 🥲. 

Just getting through the reading made me want to scoop my eyes out with a spoon and now I’m going to have to re-visit that godforsaken book again. 

Thankfully, I have about 2 more weeks for this 3rd but fml either way. How soul crushing this feels to know that this class is standing in the way of completing my term early and on a less stressed out note.

1lchbko,2se63,WGU,C715 - Tips and Tricks (Passed in 1 day),"**Difficulty: 3/10**

*(I am an accelerator so I am trying to get through non career courses ASAP, these posts are like journal entries, to help people and to reflect*)

This was my first WGU class. I took the PA 9 days before my start date, which helped me come out the gates swinging. I did fail it, but it let me know where my weak spots are.

**Thoughts:**

This being my first class I was still trying to get the hang of the online system. I had a ton of trouble with the E-book, i hated trying to use it *(ebook 0/10 it sucks*). I'm happy my other classes have online modules. This class was fairly logical and straight forward.

**Rant:**

No one prepared me for the ridiculous proctor experience, I waited in the lobby for 45 minutes in order to get a proctor who disconnected after 2 minutes. Waited another 30 mins with support and finally got someone, then I lost connection, which is completely my fault but added to my anger. I took a 2 hour break and came back and knocked the test out. Guardian browser is terrible, but we have to make the best of it, I've learned to immediately refresh the proctor window as soon as it loads if I don't see text appear(which I never do). Guardian browser: (0/10).

**Tips:**

There are some specific terms you'll have to know, not knowing the jargon is the main reason I failed. There's some helpful [quizlet's](https://quizlet.com/224193378/wgu-c715-organizational-behavior-flash-cards/) on this, I recommend going thru the flash cards a few times until you've got it down.

With that in mind, I just took the PA and there was a question that stumped me that I'm hoping someone could help me with? 

The Movie table has the following columns:
ID - integer, primary key
Title - variable-length string
Genre - variable-length string
RatingCode - variable-length string
Year - integer

The YearStats table has the following columns:
Year - integer
TotalGross - bigint unsigned
Releases - integer

Write an SQL query to display both the Title and the TotalGross (if applicable) for all movies. Ensure your result set returns the columns in the order indicated.

The answer I tried was:

SELECT Title, TotalGross
FROM Movie
LEFT JOIN YearStats ON Movie.Year = YearStats.Year

This returned results, but the test runs failed. I also tried just a regular join just in case - but that also failed the test runs.

Duration: 15 days

OA1: This portion is straightforward. I regret the amount of time I spent on these chapters. The book is awful. The way it explains things is so convoluted that I would read through the lesson and not understand a thing. I  suggest you watch these videos from edspira for the first unit, maybe skim the chapter a bit. Try to read the rest of the chapters from there, and then spam the PA. The OA and PA are practically the same. It's all just Excel. Don't overthink the exam.

OA2: Like I said, the book is awful, and the videos embedded aren't very good. I ran most of the chapters through GPT for study guides and used those to study. I suggest doing the practice questions in the class resources for this class. These were a bit harder than the PA. If you know how to do these, then you'll know how to get through the OA. Know your ratios, Net and gross method, annuity due and ordinary annuity, lower cost or market, and how to journal accounts.

First and foremost: USE YOUR CALCULATOR TO IT'S FULLEST POTENTIAL. Seriously though, you can learn to use your calculator to solve about 20% of the questions. Be smart about it. There are plenty of ways to use your calculator in strategic ways to solve some of this.



Second: The Zybooks are terrible. Open them once every 10 days to keep from getting kicked out of the class, but other than that, they're worthless. 



3rd: Get a subscription to CHATGPT. This is your new tutor. 

  
  
This is literally all you have to do: 

* Go to the bottom of the main page for the class
* Click on the [Supplemental Resources](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/GenEdMathDomain/calcdiscrete/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FGenEdMathDomain%2Fcalcdiscrete%2FShared%20Documents%2FStudent%20Facing%20Documents%2FC960%20Supplemental%20Resources&viewid=3990996e%2D29ee%2D427d%2Dbc49%2Da3d9e02d6577)
* Find the [C960 Unit Review Forms](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/GenEdMathDomain/calcdiscrete/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FGenEdMathDomain%2Fcalcdiscrete%2FShared%20Documents%2FStudent%20Facing%20Documents%2FC960%20Supplemental%20Resources&viewid=3990996e%2D29ee%2D427d%2Dbc49%2Da3d9e02d6577)
* Screenshot each question in each section
* Open ChatGPT using the model o4-mini-high (The model that worked best for me doing this type of math. 4o would hallucinate and lose the plot, o3 and o4-mini would take too long to do things and get too ""by the books"" and overcomplicate things)
* Paste it into ChatGPT and tell it NOT to answer the question, but to use it as a baseline to give you 3 sample questions
* Answer those questions
* If you don't know how to solve something, ask the agent to walk you through solving it BUT ""don't overcomplicate it, I'm bad at formulas, I'm bad at math. I have a whiteboard and a TI84+ and couldn't remember a formula to save my life. Just teach me how to work through it in the simplest way possible"" Then give you 3 more sample questions. 

That's literally it. It's that easy. Just keep grinding out sample questions until you can solve them. 

The big problem with this class is the material, every resource guide, every video, EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION is riddled with trash language drawn up by some nerd. ""The binomial coefficient of the factorial frequency of ""x|n¬ΣΦ| divided by 2x3 nPrC"" is the probability of a coconut falling on your head, but if AND ONLY IF the coconut is identical to the rest of the coconuts, because if they're individuals then you need to BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.""  
  
This strategy will teach you how to do this without all that garbage. It's gonna say ""oh the problem looks like this"" to get the answer use ""12 nCr 3"" on the calculator. Maybe one or two other steps. This is how you take this class and make it easy to understand. 

BONUS, YOU STILL LEARN HOW TO DO THE THING, IT'S JUST NOT OVERCOMPLICATED FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON!

Thank you for coming to my TED TALK

  
NOTE: Below is my ChatGPT prompt. Yea, I know, it's probably garbage and could be way better. I'm no prompt engineer. DON'T JUDGE ME IT WORKED **LOL** 

  
""Hello, you're going to help me practice for a math test. I'm going to upload a screenshot with a multiple choice discrete math 2 question. You will examine the question, and give me 3 similar questions using different wording and numbers. Keep in mind, the sample questions will all be multiple choice. There must always be exactly one correct answer, and the answer choices should be mixed up (this means all of the questions can't be the same answer choice ie: all of them are choice A or whatever). I'll answer the questions, and then you will tell me if I was correct or not. After that we will move on. Keep in mind, there are some that I won't do well on. When I ask for you to walk me through a question (which will happen) remember that I DO NOT LIKE FORMULAS OR MAKING THIS COMPLICATED AT ALL. I want to simply be able to work through the problems as simply as possible with the tools that I have available. The tools I have are a white board and a TI84. I'm just trying to work through these, that's all. In the simplest shortcut way possible.

1lw1wmx,2se63,WGU,1 year after starting WGU and my personal thoughts.,"Ok, so it's been a year since I started WGU and I'm halfway in the Software Engineering Bachelors to Masters bridge program.

I find that a lot of the work is helpful towards pushing myself into a new career path but my biggest criticism are the Zybooks and how Testing is handled.

  
I'm not going to beat a dead horse over the proctoring software but I will state that I'm not a big fan of the Zybooks and I don't find their resources to be too helpful or to prepare you for testing.

  
When I started last year about every single class had recorded cohorts especially since I work nights and have an inconsistent schedule to make it to a CI's cohort, but now those resources are mostly gone. Mainly because a lot of the courses have been updated as of 5/1/2025

Course Chatter is gone, a lot of the new courses have their course resources empty, and a lot of time even after reading the Zybooks 2 or 3 times I'm still playing the guessing game, and since Janurary, Every class I took that has an OA I've failed at least once or twice, it's infuriating with the lack of preparedness and the wording on the OA's can be tricky, non-standardized terms and sometimes confusing. Especially if the test has an Operator precedence question, which can be different jumping from statistics, algebra, Python, Java, and now SQL. and a good example of this, I am in the Approaching competency bracket of D426 after. 

What I think there needs to be more of, Supplemental pretests, more transparency on study materials, because for 3 CU's, Data structures & Algorithms, Data management Foundations, and other classes are very definition heavy, meanwhile the the actual coded exam versions feel easier despite carrying 4 CUs, and bring back recorded cohorts, I don't think it's fair I'm watching stuff from C176 and having to guess what is relevant on the new version of the test and what isn't.

  
Hope ya'll are enjoying the new courses and find them insightful, but I kinda wish they updated the new courses with new cohorts right out of the gate and more materials.

1lwn63i,byzzv1,WGU_Psychology,D582--Introduction to Statistics for Research,"OA quick reference rev sheet

(everything above the line was provided by: u/mulberrybby, everything after I used Chat for. please rev it thoroughly since i'm rushing and can't)

If there’s two cortical values. EX: -2.56 and 3.01

if that last number is in between = fail to reject. If it’s above it or below it you’ll reject hypothesis. Ex: 3.00 would fail. 3.02 = reject. Trick to remember: “we reject outsiders”

The same will happen if the question mentions T-test and there’s a significance level. If it’s below the tail you’re going to fail and if it’s above the tail you’ll reject. It’s the same principle, outsiders are rejected it’s just that visually the test looks different.

For a question that mentions difference of means, it’s gonna be opposite than what we just said. Remember that by difference of means. So if that p-level (whatever the last number is), is above you’ll fail to reject and if it’s below you’ll reject.

Chi test = \^difference of means. Above-fail to reject, below-reject.

If the question mentions f-stats, if that last number is below = 1 and if it’s above = 2.

And then it’ll be opposite for anova sig.

not the cortical values

(Put this on whiteboard before OA. 

Go through PA and figure out the tricks to it too. It genuinely doesn’t involve a lot of thinking, just figuring out why the correct answers are the correct answers and then remembering that and using it for the OA. It aligns really well with. Then for those charts questions? Where they’re like “this is the data we have, what chart should we use” finding ways to remember what to use helps as well. I asked ChatGPT for phrases to remember. A lot of the OA is memorizing the right things.)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(I followed that advice and used chat to examine everything more in-depth.)

🧠 Core Mnemonic #1: “Reject the Outsiders”

This applies to cortical values and T-tests with critical values:

If the test value is beyond the cutoffs (e.g., -2.56 or 3.01), you reject the null.

If it falls between, you fail to reject.

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Outsiders get rejected, insiders stay protected.”

🔹 Think of the distribution curve: values far in the tails are extreme (outsiders) → reject.

Example:

Critical region: -2.56 to 3.01

Result: 3.00 → within range → Fail to reject

Result: 3.02 → outside range → Reject

🧠 Core Mnemonic #2: “P is Low, Null Must Go”

This applies to p-values in tests like chi-square or t-tests without cortical values.

If p < alpha (like 0.05) → Reject the null.

If p > alpha → Fail to reject.

Mnemonic:

🔹 “P is low, null must go.”

🔹 “P is high, let it lie.”

🔄 Chi-Square & Difference of Means = Opposite Logic

Chi and mean difference tests often flip the intuitive logic. So remember this:

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Chi and Mean are Mean—they flip the scene!”

Above alpha → Fail to reject

Below alpha → Reject

Trigger phrase: “Chi tests and Mean tests? Flip your guess.”

📊 F-Stats vs ANOVA Significance

F-Stat results:

🔹 F < 1 → Fail to reject

🔹 F > 2 → Reject

ANOVA Sig (p-value):

🔹 Flip the rule

🔹 Low p-value (sig < .05) = Reject

Mnemonic:

🔹 “F above 2, we’re through (reject). F below 1, we’re done (fail).”

🔹 “ANOVA is the flip script—low sig means reject quick!”

📈 Chart Type Matching Mnemonics

Here’s a quick cheat sheet for chart types based on the type of data or finding:

🔹 Bar Chart = Categories

Use when: You compare discrete categories (e.g., gender, majors, regions).

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Bars are for boxes.” (Think of discrete boxes/categories)

Example: Compare number of students by major.

🔹 Histogram = Distribution

Use when: You show the distribution of a continuous variable.

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Histos hug the axis.” (Think of continuous bins on x-axis)

Example: Distribution of test scores.

🔹 Line Chart = Trends Over Time

Use when: Showing change over time or continuous data.

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Lines show time.”

Example: Sales over 12 months.

🔹 Pie Chart = Proportions

Use when: Showing parts of a whole

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Pie divides the pie.”

Example: Market share percentages.

🔹 Scatterplot = Correlation

Use when: Displaying relationship between two continuous variables

Mnemonic:

🔹 “Scatters show connection.”

Example: Hours studied vs. exam score.

The school even admitted that I encountered a ""FORBIDDEN"" error and shouldn't have been able to move forward with the test, and I still failed by literally a few questions, and they won't erase the attempt. I was getting pop-ups that were distracting the hell out of me for the whole exam. 

This course is ridiculous to begin with because even database admins will tell you that you don't need to memorize the ins and outs of why SQL does this and that to be in cybersecurity. I already work for a well-known security company and I don't need this degree. So I'm thinking of either transferring out or dropping it altogether.

I already have Sec+, Net+ and A+. I work in security and have experience in SOC as it is. So would I be better off transferring to a Masters program online or do employers actually care about Bachelors?

Also, who is the highest person I can escalate the terrible experience to? The ""assessment review"" team was an absolute joke and told me 1) we know that the exam was messed up 2) but we won't do anything about it.

I am not looking for notes or study buddies. I am just looking for tips on how I can grasp this freaking class. I fluctuate on everything even though I go in feeling confident. I got Exemplary on every section on the Pre A.

 I usually read through the text book and jot notes down (mostly the vocabulary terms), and then I watch the cohorts. This class surprisingly doesn't have very many cohort videos for each section which is frustrating and the layout is pretty confusing. My course instructor isn't very good at helping me so I'm feeling very unmotivated and lost on what I should do to pass. 

I am more of a hands on learner and not a visual learner and need steps broken down in simple terms if that makes sense.

1mgn55l,2se63,WGU,D351 Version 3,"I'll take back everything I'm saying here if I am incorrect. 

WGU's D351 Version 3 is still wrong. This course has gone through three different versions and I'm finding so many inconsistency's still. There's not many people on Reddit who have posted about version three so here's my take: 

The pre assessment appears to only go up to chapter 5 if you were to take that and glance at what you got wrong, the highest the study recommends are section 5 for the pre assessment.

I got a few questions regarding forecasting wrong that say study section 2.1 ... Chapter two has nothing to do with forecasting.

The forecasting topic doesn't start until chapter 3?

I only completed chapters 1 & 2 on Zybooks. Then I watched Caleb Curry's 8-hour YouTube video at 2x speed. After finishing the video, I took the preassessment and failed by 1\~ question.  After that, I created my own study guide using the Zybooks term list, the red text study guide, and my failed preassessment, but even with all that, there were still eight or so questions on the OA that those didn't cover. 

I didn't study a lot of SQL queries so I did miss a lot of those, if I did it over again I would study those some more before taking the OA. 

I put my study sheet on YouTube, but the quality isn't excellent, the subtitles and pronunciation are off sometimes because it's AI-generated, but it's good to listen to while driving or working.

1mrtjku,gsr7a,WGU_CompSci,C960 passed with 17 days to spare,"I failed twice before and this was my third attempt. So glad to finally have this off my plate.

I struggled the most with the long pseudo code problems. The timer was my biggest enemy the first two attempts. This time, I made a list of not the chapters I understood the best….but instead the types of problems I could solve the quickest. I went through the test and tackled the “quick” problems first and did the Euclidean/ RSA, pseudocode problems last. 
Your TI-84 and TI-84 CE can be programmed to solve certain  GCD, and Euclidean problems. A google search and you can find one to download that works for you. 

Instead of running out the timer, I had 30 minutes left to review answers.

1mwnj5c,2se63,WGU,PASSED D324,"Hey everyone, as the title says, I passed this monster of an exam with a 733 after about 3.5 days of studying 

My resources used were:
CBT Nuggets (free with 7 day trial)
Sybex book and practice exams (provided by WGU)
Pocket Prep app ($20)

Overall the exam was no where near as bad as the practice exams from Certmaster, Kaplan, or Dion. I scored a 58% on the Certmaster practice test and a 68% on the first Dion practice test.

I think that using CBT nuggets to lay a foundation and then going through the book and practice questions from the mentioned resources helped me get this done as fast as I did. 

I have been working in IT for 4ish years now so some of the concepts I was at least familiar with (roughly 30% of the content)

1ner75n,2se63,WGU,D413 Passed in 2 weeks,"Hey everyone,

I just passed **D413 (Telecommunications & Wireless Communications),** and I wanted to give back. It took me about 2 weeks to pass. I *hate reading* and passed this course out of pure spite, so if you’re struggling, you can do it too.

Before I go further: **shout-out to the Golden 3 redditors** whose posts guided me:

* [D413 passed but it was close](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1k2m9bq/d413_passed_but_it_was_close/)
* [D413 Telecomm and Wireless Communications](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/17x5o90/d413_telecomm_and_wireless_communications/)
* [D413 passed hardly, here’s why (and comments are GOATED)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1b1kxgf/d413_passed_hardly_heres_why_telecomm_and/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These three are the reason I didn’t completely drown. This post is just me pulling **all their advice + extra resources** into one place so you don’t waste time searching.

#  What to Focus On (The Real Test Hitters)

* **Multiplexing** → know type (analog/digital/optical) + real-world service.
* **Cables** → Cat1–Cat8 (speed, MHz, distance), coax (RG-6, RG-58, RG-8), fiber (SMF vs MMF, 850/1310/1550 nm, connectors).
* **Wireless** → 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax, speeds, bands, CSMA/CD vs CSMA/CA.
* **Error Detection** → Parity < Checksum < CRC.
* **OSI Layers** → what each does + which devices live there.
* **Devices** → Router, switch, firewall, bridge, hub, gateway, CSU/DSU.
* **Modems & Access Tech** → ISDN (BRI/PRI), DSL flavors, DOCSIS, T1/T3, SONET.

#  Study Resources

**Summaries**

* [GitHub AstroMined Network Fundamentals Study Guide](https://github.com/AstroMined/network-fundamentals/blob/main/Study_Guide.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com) (every chapter, faster than the book)

**Quizlets**

* [CDMA](https://youtu.be/BkThmLtjQpE?si=eNQx6xGMw8oF9jT5)

#  Final Advice

* The **PA ≠ OA**. The OA is way harder, same topics but more detailed. If you barely pass PA, keep drilling/When you take the PA, you **shouldn’t be red in anything**. If you are, it means you didn’t review it enough. Run weak areas through **ChatGPT, YouTube, Quizlets** until you feel good about it 
* Don’t try to read the whole book unless that’s your style. Use the **GitHub summaries + Quizlets + videos** for faster prep.
* Focus narrow, memorize deep. This exam is “know fewer things, but in detail.”
* Use **elimination** — 2 answers are trash, 1 is bait, 1 is correct.
* You don’t need perfect, just competence.

1ni5x75,3mggr,WGUCyberSecurity,D427 - Question about ZyBooks Labs (Syntax Error),"Not sure if this has been asked here before but does anyone else encounter a syntax error when running your code in the zybooks labs for this class?

Whenever I try to run my code in the lab it gives me the following error statement: ""ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 9: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'to ReleaseYear' at line 2""

Not really sure what to do about this as I've gone back and double checked my code at least 10 times at this point and everything seems right. I even put it into ChatGPT and it told me it's correct. I'm not sure if it's my computer that's causing this error, as I do most of my schoolwork from a company laptop (Don't own a personal laptop) and it has a lot of security controls pre-installed on it. I suspect it could be interfering with the zybooks interface as I've noticed it does this with some other online services.

And this really wouldn't be a big problem except for whenever I submit the labs for grading it straight up gives me a 0/10 grade. Anyone else ever experienced this? Any tips?

1nks1up,gsr7a,WGU_CompSci,"D288: Failed assessment because of console error, cannot recreate","Hello all! Long time lurker and near the end of my journey! 

I'm in D288, the assessment basically consists of attaching a backend to an existing front end that happens to be a website selling vacations with excursions.   
  
You have the option of building the application in a lab environment or on your personal machine. I chose the lab environment (this is all relevant to my issue). 

I'm stumped in terms of what to do in this situation (I've already emailed the CS team, but they have not gotten back to me).   


I got the following image as feedback from the assessment team: 

https://preview.redd.it/qo81kdwcb1qf1.png?width=1433&format=png&auto=webp&s=175011051d6c9a50cbad8472fdabb28f7624ae9f



My research of this error implies there is likely a dependency that would be used by the lab environment that the assessor isn't using. 

When I attempt to recreate this issue in any way possible... I do not get the error (see screen shot below. 

https://preview.redd.it/zq1s6ybqb1qf1.png?width=2007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4becd97f5c5cb12b7091802c35f58b68b5789269



  
I don't know what to do in a situation like this, because I feel like I'm getting a bit of a run around from WGU. How can I possibly escalate this and get it resolved? Is there something I'm missing? 

Either there is something I missed in the documentation of the class... or I need to find a way to speak to someone who actually can look at this more deeply, one professor has already told me they can't do anything because they have no control of assessment services, but I wonder if maybe he didn't understand what I was communicating fully and I need to bring it up to someone else or be more clear. 

I'm more or less getting the impression I'm SOL and I'm rather confused by that.

1nu2s20,2se63,WGU,Tips + AI Prompt + Websites used to pass D422 - Algorithms and Cryptography,"I saw a few posts on here from people saying they struggled with D422. It wasn't too challenging for me, but the zyBooks content is formatted in a way that isn't conducive to learning AT ALL. You just get shown a bunch of lengthy formulas along with one or two practice problems for each concept and then sent on your way. If you struggled badly with this course I understand why. You need to **join WGU Connect** **and watch the demonstration videos** **for content you don't understand**. Personally I used the demo videos to understand the worst case complexity/worst case runtime stuff and the RSA Algorithm. For everything else I used the zyBooks and asked AI to extrapolate on concepts I didn't fully grasp. Here are a few tips + resources to help you pass

**Tips:**

**1.** Get a large whiteboard + a **WGU approved** scientific calculator with modulo built in for this exam. I bought a12x16 whiteboard and a regular scientific calculator, but a calculator like the **TI-30XS  Multiview** would have saved me from second guessing myself a few times. 

**2.** Look at the practice exam and see which problems/concepts occur more frequently and matter more towards your score. If you're struggling with a certain topic, and there are only one or two questions on that topic on the practice exam, then **it's possible you can ignore a concept entirely and still pass as long as you get everything else correct...** 

**3.** Use the prompt below to generate practice questions + these websites to check the accuracy of your answers. Take out individual sections, change the amount of questions requested, do whatever helps you learn.  

**Practice Question Prompt:**

formatted as $(x)\_y$. One problem must be binary, one must be hexadecimal, and one 

must be a random four digit number for x paired with a random 1 digit number for y.



\#Number Conversion



Give me two problems where I have to convert a number from hexadecimal to binary, 

and then binary to hexadecimal. The number given in the problem must be formatted as

$(x)\_y$. The hexadecimal number must a random three to four digit number. The binary number

must be one byte, with leading zeroes omitted.



\#Base (b) Expansion



Give me three problems where I have to find the base (b) expansion of a given number (x).

The question should be formatted as ""find the base (b) expansion of (x). Variable b should

be a random one digit number ranging from 3-9, and variable x should be a random 

two digit number ranging from from 50-99.





\#Minimum Digits to Represent Base Expansion

Give me two problems where I have to find the minimum amount of digits required to represent

the base expansion of a number.



\#Fast Exponentiation

Give me two fast exponentiation problems. The first problem should ask for the fast exponential form of a given two digit number,

(x), in the form of x = 2\^j with x being a two digit number. The second problem should ask for the value of a given two digit number, 

(x) along with an exponent,(y), in the form of x\^y = b\^2j



\#Worst Case Complexity/Runtime

Give me four problems like this:

**Paste one of the zyBooks practice problems on the concept here. I removed the one I used to stay compliant with subreddit/WGU rules**



Where I have to determine the worst case runtime or worst case complexity of a function. You can include answers like



O(log)n)) / O(log2)n)), O(n), O(n\^2), O(n\^3),O(n log(n)) 





\#Function Outputs



Give me three problems like this: Given the pseudocode fragment:

**Paste some of the ZyBooks practice problems on the concept here. I removed the ones I used to stay compliant with subreddit/WGU rules**

What is the final value/output of a given variable?

Where I have to determine the output of a function
