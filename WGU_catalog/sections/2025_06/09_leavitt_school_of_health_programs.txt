Leavitt School of Health
Leavitt School of Health Tenets:
• Each student is unique. We align our systems and resources using Learner-Centered Faculty (LCF) tools to
support each personal journey toward graduation and success in their chosen healthcare career.
• Access matters. The lack of diversity in ethnicity and gender in the healthcare workforce contributes to the
continued disparities in health outcomes. We create access for diverse populations through onramps and visible
career pathways to change the composition of the healthcare workforce and improve health outcomes.
• Equity is an opportunity equalizer. We eliminate barriers and allocate resources to provide equity in access and
education for our learners, so they demonstrate equity in the care and services they provide as graduates. We
focus on improving fairness and eliminating bias in teaching and learning.
• Data matters. Our insights come from examining (and improving) processes at the program level and every level
of the college using the lens of our learner populations as our guide. Disparities in learner outcomes signal needed
changes in student support and data informs our ability to adjust in agile ways.
• Our learning products power the healthcare workforce. We continually evaluate the learning needs of the
healthcare industry and diversify our portfolio to include in-demand health professions degrees, microcredentials
and other learning products that position students for career success and provide needed talent to employers.
• Value and affordability are of equal importance. High quality, accredited health professions education requires
validation of competencies for patient and system engagement through supervised field experiences. We ensure
that learners are well prepared for the complexities of practice and carefully evaluate costs, so students have an
affordable, relevant education while ensuring quality and college sustainability.
• Partnerships accelerate our impact. We accelerate our reach and impact through mutually beneficial
partnerships. These relationships include donors, employers, educational institutions and healthcare industry
organizations and associations.
