Teachers College Tenets:
• WGU’s Teachers College radically improves the way people learn and lead across the K-20+ spectrum—i.e., the
K- 12, higher-education, and workforce-education sectors.
• The surest path toward helping our students become next-generation educators is to ensure they experience high-
quality, next-generation education.
• We know our students and are committed to supporting each one as they work to learn well, finish strong, and
launch effectively into the next phase of their learning or working journey.
• School districts, colleges, universities, and industry employers are our customers too. Developing programming
and services that meet their strategic needs matters.
• We are a beacon of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) impact in both expanding access and improving
attainment.
• We own and champion larger-WGU strategic goals around student outcomes and financial sustainability.
• Our people are our college. How we recruit, hire, develop, evaluate, and culturally integrate our team is the most
tangible evidence of our values and expectations around DEI, learning quality, and student care.
Steps to Become a Licensed Teacher
https://www.wgu.edu/online-teaching-degrees/becoming-licensed-teacher-accredited.html
WGU offers teacher certification programs including bachelor’s and master’s degree programs. Below is the standard
process for earning an initial teaching license through the WGU Teachers College.
1a. Earn a bachelor's degree
The online bachelor's teaching degree programs in the Teachers College at WGU include coursework and assessments,
a preclinical experience that includes observation hours and teaching lessons, and Student Teaching (explained in step
5).
1b. Complete a master’s degree (if you already have a bachelor’s degree)
If you already possess a bachelor’s degree in a non-teaching field, WGU’s Master of Arts in Teaching programs are the
choice for you. These teacher-prep programs qualify you to become licensed in the field of your choice (such as
elementary education, secondary mathematics, science, etc.), training you to become a highly qualified teacher. These
programs include supervised practice teaching (see step 5: Student Teaching) in an actual classroom setting.
2. Pass a background check
WGU requires all candidates for a teacher-certification program to provide the university with verification of a cleared
background check prior to entering the classroom for preclinical experiences and Student Teaching. Previously
completed background checks may not satisfy WGU background check requirements. In some states, more than one
background check may be required. In addition, most states require that applicants for teacher certification complete a
background check for the Department of Education prior to submitting all application paperwork. This is a necessary
precaution designed to prevent those who may pose a danger to the students in the classroom. You must be at least 18
years of age before you may begin the application process or participate in preclinical experiences and Student
Teaching.
3. Pass basic skills, content, and pedagogy exams
Each state has specific testing requirements that must be met or completed in addition to completing a teaching degree
program at WGU. WGU requires students to complete and pass:
• Basic Skills Exam: Pass the Basic Skills Exam required by your state for certification, or a designated Basic Skills
Exam if your state does not require one.
• Content Exam: You must pass the designated Content Exam(s) required by your state in order to graduate from
your program.
• WGU Program Exam: WGU also requires you to pass a specific Praxis exam to graduate from your program (with
© Western Governors University May 22, 2025 164
the exception of Elementary programs), often in addition to any certification exam required by your state.
• Pedagogy Exam: Finally, some states require the completion of a Pedagogy Exam, which assesses your
knowledge of teaching methods.
4. Complete preclinical experiences
In preparation for your formal Student Teaching (described in step 5 below), you will complete preclinical experiences
designed to introduce you to the classroom through a series of activities, including observations and lesson planning.
Working under the guidance of a WGU Placement Specialist, you will be asked to make arrangements with a local school
to complete these activities.
5. Complete a term of in-classroom Student Teaching
Student Teaching is a critical component of any teaching degree program. This in-classroom experience is invaluable in
helping to integrate the academic knowledge and teaching skills you’ve developed to this point into a practical application
that will prepare you to tackle the challenges of your own classroom effectively and with confidence.
Student Teaching at WGU covers the competencies required for in-classroom proficiency. Student Teaching is a full-
time, supervised, in-classroom experience of a minimum of 12–20 weeks. During Student Teaching, you will be hosted
by an experienced teacher. You will undergo a series of at least six observations by a Clinical Supervisor and also
receive evaluations from your Mentor Teacher to evaluate your performance based on accepted professional standards.
As you approach your Student Teaching, a WGU Placement Specialist will work with you to set up your placement. The
process of scheduling your placement may take up to six months. You may be required to assist in the process of setting
up your placement. In some cases, you may be required to commute up to two hours (or in rare cases longer than this).
Note that students are not permitted to work during their Student Teaching experience. You must be at least 18 years of
age before you may begin the application process or participate in preclinical experiences or Student Teaching.
Student Teaching may not be waived and prior experience may not be used to satisfy this requirement as you must
demonstrate competency in the classroom in order to complete your WGU degree program.

Initial Licensure Programs - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Clinical-Experiences-Handbook/tkb-p/fieldplacement
Advanced Programs - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Clinical-Experiences-Handbook/tkb-p/advancedprograms
6. Meet any additional state certification requirements
Some states have additional requirements for certification, such as coursework not included in your WGU program, CPR
certification, or workshops.

Bachelor of Arts, Educational Studies in Secondary Earth Science Education
The Bachelor of Arts, Educational Studies in Science Education (Secondary Earth Science) includes content
knowledge related to secondary Earth Science teaching. This program consists of online courses which take the
learner from general education through methods of instruction, Earth Science content, assessment, and classroom
management, to secondary education courses for interacting with secondary-level students. It does not include
supervised clinical experiences in a real classroom and does not meet the requirements for initial teacher licensure.
This program is for individuals who, for various reasons, want academic knowledge that relates to teaching but who
cannot or do not want to participate in clinical experiences to be eligible to teach as a result of completing the
program. This is a non-licensure program and will not, in any state, lead to an institutional recommendation for
licensure.

Master of Arts in Teaching, Elementary Education
The Master of Arts in Teaching Elementary Education (MATELED) is a competency-based degree program that
prepares students with the competencies at the graduate level needed to apply for licensure as an elementary
educator. This program consists of online courses which take the learner from educational professional core
coursework, continuing through methods of elementary instruction and assessment, including inclusive practices for
students with mild to moderate exceptionalities. Candidates develop and refine their teaching skills through a series of
sequential experiences beginning with video-based observations and simulations of classroom instruction to prepare
candidates for authentic, collaborative, clinical teaching experiences in elementary settings. Clinical experiences
include teaching in face-to-face environments and culminate with supervised student teaching in a real classroom.
With the successful completion of degree requirements for graduation, including required assessments in the major
area of teaching, the student can receive institutional recommendation for licensure in elementary education.

The Master of Arts in Teaching, Special Education (MATSPED) is a competency-based program that enables teacher
candidates to earn a Master of Arts degree with a concentration in Special Education, Mild to Moderate disabilities
which leads to an initial licensure in Special Education (K-12) teaching certificate. The program will be completed
online except for preclinical experiences, classroom clinical components, and student teaching. This program will
involve an intensive, fast-paced education in fundamental issues, methodology, knowledge, and skills for special
education teachers. The Master of Arts in Special Education, Mild to Moderate Exceptionalities program is specifically
designed for the preparation of prospective teachers to work with students with mild to moderate disabilities in a
variety of educational settings, including inclusion K-12 classrooms and resource classrooms. This program consists
of online courses which take the learner educational professional core coursework and continues with specialized
courses for special education content and methods of instruction, assessment, and behavioral interventions.
Candidates develop and refine their teaching skills through a series of sequential experiences beginning with video-
based observations and simulations of classroom instruction to prepare candidates for authentic, collaborative, clinical
teaching experiences in P-12 special education settings. Multiple clinical experiences include teaching in face-to-face
environments and culminate with supervised student teaching in two authentic classroom placements, one in an
elementary special education setting and another in a secondary special education setting. Both placements support
the academic needs of students seeking a license across all P-12 grades with mild-to-moderate disabilities. With the
successful completion of degree requirements for graduation, including required assessments in the major area of
teaching, the student can receive institutional recommendation for licensure in special education.
