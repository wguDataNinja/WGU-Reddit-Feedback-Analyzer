School of Technology
School of Technology Tenets:
• We believe education is the single greatest catalyst to change lives permanently. By providing affordable, high-
value competency-based education in IT at scale, we provide opportunities to maximize professional and personal
outcomes for as many learners as possible.
• Information Technology opportunities are ubiquitous across industries and are critical to solving global challenges,
both current and future. We leverage strategic partnerships, portfolio research, and skills mapping to identify,
develop, and deliver innovative learning approaches and access pathways that enable students to succeed in
current as well as future technical and career environments.
• Those with the least access to education have the most to gain for themselves, their families, and the world:
equitable attainment for the underserved and underrepresented is a force multiplier in our impact. Through
ongoing innovation in learning analytics, personalized support, focused efforts around diversity, and differentiated
unbiased curriculum, we meet learners where they are and scaffold them to success no matter their background.
• Our learners flourish when they are skilled in not only technological systems but also innovation, integration,
critical thinking, and problem solving. Our curriculum choices ensure that industry-relevant skills are integrated
with complementary skill sets that scaffold students’ ability to make informed choices in business and across
society.
• We are part of a lifelong learning journey for our students and offer flexible learning at multiple points along that
timeline. While certifications help our students get the next job, our degrees grow their careers and change their
lives. We maintain the relevancy of both to ensure student short-term and long-term success.
• Our people are our college, and our collective success enables student success. By focusing on the wellbeing and
growth of each contributor, we maximize our potential and therefore that of our students by achieving together.

Bachelor of Science, Information Technology (BSIT to MSITM)
Students enrolled in the Accelerated Information Technology Bachelor's and Master's Degree program will first
complete the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology portion of the program, and after completing the
necessary bachelors and bridge course work will receive the Bachelor of Science, Information Technology degree.
Students will then progress to the remaining graduate course work, and upon completion will receive the Master of
Science, Information Technology Management degree. The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (IT)
degree program provides a solid foundation in computer information systems and technologies. In addition to the IT
content, the degree program includes a broad collegiate-level education. The program is primarily designed for those
seeking a career or to advance their current career as information technology professionals by developing levels of
expertise required for increased responsibility in the information technology field. The foundation of the Bachelor of
Science program consists of six domains of study: systems and services, networking and security, scripting and
programming, data management, business of IT, and web development. At the end of the program, students develop
a comprehensive portfolio and complete a capstone project. The Master of Science in Information Technology
Management is a competency-based degree program that represents a path for successful IT professionals to launch
their careers and build them to an executive level. The graduate will advance his or her knowledge and skills through
a practical, real-world program based on sound principles of Information Technology revolving around three primary
themes: communication, technical competence and strategic vision: effective communication as essential to
management at all levels, in all areas of human endeavor; and strategic vision that takes individuals and organizations
beyond immediate difficulties and successes to a perception of future challenges and preparations to meet those
challenges.
