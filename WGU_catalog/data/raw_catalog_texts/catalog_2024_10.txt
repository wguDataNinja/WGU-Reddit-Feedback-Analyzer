About Western Governors University
Why are we called Western Governors University? Our name tells the story of our founding—a story that dates back to
1997, when a group of U.S. governors came up with an innovative answer to a question of growing concern: How can we
ensure more of our residents have greater access to a college education that fits their schedule? That meeting of the
Western Governors' Association marked the beginnings of a new national university.
From the beginning, we were designed to be different. The U.S. governors who founded WGU knew that the college
student of the 21st century would be very different from students in the past. For millions of working adults, the dream of
pursuing a college education could only become a reality once the boundaries of time and place could be removed.
Overcoming this challenge was at the heart of the WGU idea.
It was the mid-1990s, and a new technology was quickly emerging: the internet. As more and more Americans were able
to get online, the possibility of an ''anywhere, anytime'' education became a reality. And more than simply delivering
traditional, lecture-based learning via modem and monitor, our founders recognized that technology could be used to
fundamentally change the way college students learn. Harnessing the power of the internet and our innovative new
learning model—competency-based education—WGU revolutionized the way students learn, master concepts, and
progress to a degree.
As a nonprofit, online university founded by governors, WGU is different. But even beyond the unique story of our
founding and the foresight of our founders, WGU is different for a more fundamental reason: We do education differently.
WGU is mission-driven. Created to expand access to higher education through online, competency-based degree
programs, WGU’s mission has remained one of helping hardworking adults meet their educational goals and improve
their career opportunities. Our mission is to change lives for the better by creating pathways to opportunity.
Core Academic Commitments
WGU Core Academic Commitments support our mission to create pathways to opportunity by ensuring students receive
an education with value, integrity, relevancy, transparency, and personalization.
• Value: Advance the value of WGU's competency-based education model and credentials.
• Integrity: Base each credential on a relevant assessment of competence that is psychometrically sound and
assessed with integrity.
• Relevance: Align every competency to skills that can stack to high-value marketable skills, applicable knowledge,
and respected credentials.
• Transparency: Design skills, competencies, and credentials to be surfaced on a sharable learner-owned record.
• Personalization: Personalize pathways, pace, and support to ensure equitable access and attainment of
credentials.
WGU equips students with the skills employers want, backed by credentials employers trust.
Competency-Based Education
Colleges and universities traditionally require attendance in a classroom, conferring degrees based on completion of a
certain set of courses for a given number of credit hours. As an online institution that provides its students the
convenience of studying and completing coursework outside the classroom, WGU provides competency-based courses
to complete its degree and non-degree requirements. Competency-based programs allow students to demonstrate that
they have acquired the competencies (levels of knowledge, skill, or ability) required for a particular degree or certificate.
Students have often acquired many of the skills necessary for a degree through life or work experience. WGU’s system
enables students to utilize previously learned skills in proving their competencies.
A team of faculty have identified the required competencies for each program offered at WGU. Competencies summarize
the critical knowledge and skill levels essential for mastery of a particular field. WGU students demonstrate mastery of
competencies by completing assessments. An assessment may be a test, a project, an essay, or another practical
demonstration of a required skill. Therefore, assessments might look like:
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 7
• Assignments involving problem-solving in science or information technology.
• Computerized math examinations consisting of multiple-choice, matching, and other question types.
• Projects requiring the student to design a lesson plan about American history.
• Reflection essays about case studies.
• Research papers on particular topics within the student’s field.
Each assessment measures knowledge and skill in a given area through appropriate means. Assessments are
developed using a rigorous process that conforms to professional testing standards. This process yields high-quality
exams, reliable results, and supports valid conclusions about each student’s level of competence. Students can be
confident that all their assessments, whether computerized exams or performance tasks, align to and demonstrate
specific competencies in their individual degree programs.
Accreditation
Accreditation provides external, expert evaluation of WGU’s programs and policies, eases the transfer of credits to other
accredited institutions, and legitimizes degree credentials for employers and colleges.
NWCCU
Western Governors University is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities. Accreditation of
an institution of higher education by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities indicates that it meets or
exceeds criteria for the assessment of institutional quality evaluated through a peer review process. An accredited
college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through
appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue to do so
in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation. Accreditation by the Northwest
Commission on Colleges and Universities is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a
guarantee of every course or program offered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides reasonable
assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution. Inquiries regarding an
institution’s accredited status by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities should be directed to the
administrative staff of the institution. Individuals may also contact: Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities;
8060 165th Avenue NE, Suite 100; Redmond, WA 98052; (425) 558-4224; www.nwccu.org.

Washington, DC 20036; (202) 223-0077.
AAQEP
The teacher licensure programs offered through the WGU Teachers College have been awarded full accreditation by the
Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation (AAQEP) through June 30, 2026. Full accreditation
acknowledges that a program prepares effective educators who continue to grow as professionals and that the program
has demonstrated the commitment and capacity to continue to do so.

Health Informatics and Information Management Education (CAHIIM). The College’s accreditation for the baccalaureate
degree in health information management has been reaffirmed through 2030. All inquiries about the program’s

Academic Program Governance
Academic programs are developed and guided by WGU administrators working through several councils comprised of
academicians and industry experts in the various fields of knowledge. Each programmatic area (e.g., undergraduate
nursing, initial licensure for teaching) has a program council which is the faculty governing body for the degree or non-
degree program. Program councils, along with the program coordinator, are responsible for overseeing the development
of the curriculum (including competence descriptions, subdomains, and domains), overseeing all assessments, and
updating the curriculum.
In addition to program councils, an Assessment Council is responsible for working with program leaders, assessment
development vendors, and WGU assessment staff to ensure that WGU’s assessments are appropriate tests of the
competencies identified by the program leaders.
For a listing of members of each Council, see https://www.wgu.edu/about/university-governance.html.
Faculty Composition
WGU employs a disaggregated faculty model across the university. The aggregated roles and tasks performed by
traditional university professors (e.g., meeting with and advising students, course or curriculum design, instruction,
assessment) are distributed among faculty members. Consequently, the jobs of individual WGU faculty members focus
on single aspects of the academic experience, and students are supported by a team of faculty. Within WGU, there are
several faculty roles and associated tasks:
Assessment Faculty – An individual with expertise in assessment theory and practice who is responsible for the design,
development, and continuous improvement of assessments that support a competency-based curriculum in accordance
with industry best practices.
Curriculum Faculty – An individual with expertise in curriculum theory and practice who is responsible for the design,
development, and evaluation of competency-based curricula to provide relevant, robust learning experiences.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 10
Clinical Faculty – Professional experts who provide clinical instruction and evaluation to students in individual or group
settings to support students in meeting the practice requirements for licensure.
Instructors – Subject-matter experts who provide direct instruction to students in individual and/or group settings, and
who are responsible for providing course-specific student support that is effective, engaging, and appropriately
personalized.
Program Mentors – An individual with professional or domain expertise in program competencies who provides academic
guidance and personalized programmatic instruction and support to students.
Evaluators – Subject matter experts responsible for providing robust, personalized feedback on performance
assessments and evaluating student competency.
Faculty Leaders – Individuals with academic or professional expertise who manage teams of faculty and are accountable
for ensuring faculty provide timely, appropriately personalized student instruction or support that develops student
competency and supports student success. Faculty leaders are responsible for collaborating with Program Chairs to
make academic decisions that ensure program quality and strong student outcomes.
Honorary Faculty – An individual who is a recognized expert, nationally or internationally renowned in their field, or a
highly reputed scholar in their field and is thereby, uniquely qualified based on exceptional academic or professional
expertise. Honorary faculty may not necessarily meet stated minimum qualifications for other faculty positions.
Program Chairs – An individual with academic or professional expertise in the program domain who is accountable for
the integrity, excellence, national reputation, and continuous improvement of a portfolio of relevant educational programs
through leadership, innovation, fiscal efficiency, partnerships, and the advancement of the discipline. This administrative
faculty person is accountable for the quality, relevance, and performance of one or more academic programs. Chairs are
responsible for the financial, academic, and reputational health of the program(s) they lead and work closely with faculty
leaders to produce strong student outcomes.
Academic Calendar
The traditional academic calendar with limited enrollment periods, holidays, and other significant dates is not applicable.
In WGU’s continuous-enrollment model, new groups of degree-seeking students start on the first day of every month.
Students can access learning resources, schedule assessments, and complete performance assessments anytime.
WGU’s academic calendar divides a student’s academic year into two, six-month semesters called ''terms.'' The six
months that make up a term are based on when the student begins the program. For example, if a student begins the
program on February 1, the first term will last from February 1 through July 31. The second term would begin August 1.
Learning Resources
WGU students use a variety of learning resources, included in the cost of attendance, to acquire the skills and knowledge
needed to complete assessments. These learning resources come in a variety of forms (e.g., e-textbooks, web-based
tutorials, simulations, online labs).
Student Services
Students enrolling at WGU become part of our community of faculty and staff who are united under one goal: student
success. The Student Services office is available during extended hours to assist students with general questions and
administrative or accessibility issues. The Student Services team helps students resolve issues, listens to student issues
and concerns, and makes recommendations for improving policy and practice based on student feedback. The Student
Services team provides a formal means by which students can express their views, and those views in turn inform the
decisions we make.
The Student Services team assists students with unresolved concerns to find equitable resolutions. Prior to contacting
the Student Services office with a complaint, students should work with their Program Mentor. Mentors have the
expertise to guide students toward goals and direct them to resources to be successful. If, however, students have an
issue or problem that cannot be resolved by their Program Mentor, they are invited to contact the Student Services office.
Student Services can also assist students who wish to request to be assigned to a different Program Mentor.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 11
To contact the Student Services team, please call 877.435.7948 or email studentservices@wgu.edu. Representatives
are available Monday through Friday from 6 AM to 10 PM MT and Saturday from 7 AM to 7 PM MT (closed Sunday).
Financial Services

Student Wellness
WGU offers each student WellConnect™, a free, voluntary, and confidential service which offers counseling and support
services to students. WellConnect™ provides support with a live clinician by phone 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Due
to WGU’s online presence and lack of a physical campus, the WellConnect student assistance program constitutes the
extent of healthcare services available to WGU students.
Commencement
WGU hosts virtual and live commencement weekends over the course of the year, with new cities and events each year.
WGU’s Alumni Relations team provides these opportunities for students, graduates, and families to come together to
celebrate their accomplishments and achievements. Visit www.wgu.edu/commencement for details.
Alumni Engagement
WGU’s Alumni Community of graduates is quickly growing. To help support these graduates, the Alumni Engagement
team is constantly seeking new ways to provide alumni with the tools and resources they need to succeed in the next
phase of their lives. Graduates have free access to these tools and resources on the alumni community website:
www.wgu.edu/alumni.
Connect with other graduates using WGU’s Night Owl Network, a state-of-the-art networking platform developed
specifically for fostering mentorship experiences, or the WGU Alumni LinkedIn Group. These are both closed groups, as
graduates and students must request to be added as a member.
WGU Night Owl Network: www.wgu.edu/alumni/stay-involved.html
WGU Alumni LinkedIn Group: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/51112
WGU is eager to provide leadership opportunities to alumni who are dedicated to representing the university by hosting a
networking event, working with a student or prospective student who could use advice from someone who’s ''been there,''
helping at commencement, facilitating corporate and school district partnerships along with WGU, etc. This dedicated
group of alumni is called WGU’s Ambassadors Club. Please contact the Alumni Engagement team if you are interested
in joining WGU’s Ambassadors Club.
Career and Professional Development
WGU provides career assistance and resources to students and graduates. Career and Professional Development (CPD)
Specialists are available to educate students and graduates on how to develop a career plan, implement job- search
strategies, and assist with the creation of marketing tools such as resumes, cover letters, and professional portfolio
profiles. Additionally, students and graduates have exclusive 24/7 self-service access to professional career resources,
such as resume development and practice interview software, self-assessments, and job banks. For more information,
visit the Career and Professional Development Website: www.wgu.edu/careerservices.

Please Note: WGU does not guarantee employment upon degree completion or provide placement services.
Library
The WGU Library’s mission is to provide access and delivery of information resources independent of time and place.
The fully online digital library serves students, faculty, and staff around the clock, with library resources available to users
24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The library collection includes hundreds of thousands of ebooks, full text journals, and
licensed academic databases. WGU librarians work with vendors to provide seamless access to information resources
and to ensure patron expectations are met when using library resources. Our main search uses EBSCO Discovery
Service, allowing students to search across the majority of WGU subscriptions via a single platform. Students can also
search individual databases and ebook collections, and have access to a variety of subject-specific research guides.
For materials not immediately available in our collection, the WGU Library provides document delivery and hardcopy
book loans through the University of Michigan and Reprints Desk document delivery. Students and faculty can also
suggest titles they feel would be a valuable addition to our existing library collections. The WGU Alumni Library is
available to students upon graduation and includes alumni subscription packages and, dependent on licensing
restrictions, some content from our main library collection.
WGU librarians work with university faculty and administration to integrate library resources and information literacy
instruction directly into WGU coursework. Library staff collaborate with subject matter experts, learning resource
specialists, instructional designers, and other content selectors to ensure WGU collections align with program needs, and
to help create tailored information literacy instruction.
Students have multiple options for working with librarians for reference and research support. They can email, schedule a
phone appointment, or chat live with a librarian. The chat service is available 24/7, including holidays. The library offers
general and college-specific live webinars. Information on library use and policies may be accessed at
https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Requirements/Library-Services/ta-p/48.
Facilities
As an online university, WGU does not have a physical campus for students. Prospective students are informed of the
computer capacity requirements for successful access to all WGU systems and learning resources. WGU has various

Admissions
General Admission Requirements
WGU seeks to admit individuals who have the capacity and determination to complete a rigorous WGU certificate or
degree program. The admission process is designed to help students and the university reach an informed decision
about an applicant’s likelihood of success.
http://www.wgu.edu/admissions.html
Admissions Criteria
For each student who applies, WGU will evaluate previous academic history to include high school or college coursework
and/or work history as required.
Students may also meet admissions requirements by completing the relevant program of study at WGU Academy, a pre-
enrollment alternative pathway to regular enrollment at WGU.
To be considered for enrollment into a bachelor's degree program, applicants must possess a high school diploma or its
equivalent. Depending upon the program of interest, other specific admission requirements may also apply. See the
program-specific admission requirements below.
Applicants seeking admission to WGU must be no less than 14 years of age. Applicants seeking admission to WGU
programs leading to professional licensure must be at least 18 years of age at the time of clinical or field placement
requirements. Furthermore, applicants may not be incarcerated in a state or federal penal institution. Applicants must
also meet all other general and specific degree program admission requirements on the WGU website. For more
information on admissions policies, see https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Admission-
Requirements/ta-p/79.
For convenience, WGU starts new groups of students in most degree programs every month. Currently, WGU programs
do not require a specific score on either the SAT or ACT.
English Language Requirement (TOEFL): WGU students are expected to communicate clearly in writing and during
conversations with WGU faculty and staff. If English is not a student's native language, they must submit proof of a
qualifying score on the Internet-based Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL iBT). WGU requires a qualifying
score of 80 or higher. Please see https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Admission/English-Language-Requirement-TOEFL/ta-p/40.
Steps and Deadlines for Enrollment
1. Apply for admission and pay the application fee. The application fee is $65 and can be paid online using a credit card
or by mailing a check or money order. The application fee must be paid before an application will be fully processed.
WGU does not profit from application fees, as they help offset only a small portion of enrollment and admissions costs.
2. Send in official transcripts. Depending on the program, students may need to have a transfer evaluation or degree
verification. Students with prior college experience should send in their transcripts to help with a transfer evaluation and
admissions decision. Official copies of transcripts must arrive by the 5th of the month prior to the intended start date for
evaluation.
Official transcript copies can be submitted by mail or email (transcriptinfo@wgu.edu):
Western Governors University
ATTN: Transcripts Department
4001 South 700 East, Suite 300
Salt Lake City, UT 84107-2533
3. Complete the financial aid application process. If intending to use federal financial aid to cover tuition expenses,

Tuition and Financial Aid
Tuition and Fees for Degree Programs (Effective September 1, 2024)
WGU charges tuition at a flat rate every term. The more courses a student completes each term, the more affordable
their degree program becomes. For more information, visit https://www.wgu.edu/financial-aid-tuition.html. All prices below
are in U.S. Dollars.
Applicable to All Programs
Resource Fee: $200 Per Term
Application Fee: $65 (One Time)
Note: WGU does not ''profit'' from application fees, as they help offset only a small portion of enrollment and admission
costs. WGU charges a $200 Resource Fee each term. This fee helps cover the use of the online library, e-textbooks, and
many other learning resources. With few exceptions, required textbooks are available as e-textbooks, so students won’t
have to purchase hard copy textbooks.

Tuition Payment and Financial Policies
The Financial Aid Office can be reached by email at financialservices@wgu.edu or by calling 877.435.7948. Hours of
operation are weekdays 7 AM to 7 PM MT (closed on weekends). Please see the student handbook for an overview of
financial aid: https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Financial-Aid-Overview/ta-p/195.
WGU Financial Policy
Western Governors University is dedicated to providing the best possible education and service to our students. A
complete understanding of financial responsibilities is an essential element of a student’s education. The WGU Financial
Services office is committed to assisting all student account needs. However, students have the primary responsibility to
make sure their tuition is paid on time each term.
Payment is Required at the Beginning of Each Term
Tuition for the full term is due by the 1st day of each term. Financial clearance is due for new students on or before the
22nd of the month proceeding the first day of the first term. Acceptance of term registration confirms agreement to pay
tuition in full. For a small enrollment fee, WGU offers a payment plan for those who cannot pay in full by the required
date. To enroll in a payment plan, select the ''View Payment Plans'' link in the Financial Services section on the Student
Support tab of the student portal. Payment or payment plan participation is required by the first day of each new term.
Students in an active bankruptcy, prior collection agency placement for a balance due to WGU, or who have a prior
payment plan default, are not eligible for a WGU payment plan.
Payment Deadlines
Payments received or payment arrangements must be completed on the student portal by:
• New student with first term tuition - On the 22nd day of month prior to term start.
• Renewal term tuition - First day of the term.
Financial Aid
Students have the responsibility to apply for and submit all forms required by the Financial Aid office and be aware of
deadlines for submission. Application for financial aid is not a guarantee of funding. In the event students are approved
for financial aid and are under-funded or students become ineligible for financial aid funds they are responsible for the
financial obligation on their account. Regardless of the status of their financial aid file, it is the responsibility of students to
ensure that tuition and fees are paid by the appropriate deadline.
In accordance with federal guidelines, WGU applies funds to student accounts in the following order, as available:
• Federal Pell grant
• Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)
• State grants
• Scholarships/Tuition Assistance
• Direct subsidized loans
• Teach grant
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 26
• Americorps
• Direct unsubsidized loans
• PLUS loans
• Private loans
Payment Methods
WGU accepts cash, checks, and web checks/EFT at no additional cost to students. Credit/Debit cards (Visa, MasterCard,
Discover, and American Express) are accepted, but a 2.85% card processing fee applies. WGU does not accept post-
dated checks. WGU will not hold any check for deposit past the date of the receipt of the check. WGU is not responsible
for bank fees associated with the deposit of said check. More information about paying by check is available at
https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Tuition-Payment-and-Financial-Policies/ta-p/145.
To protect students' financial records, WGU does not accept payments over the phone, under any circumstance.
Refunds
Once eligibility for a refund is calculated, the Financial Services office processes tuition charges and refunds within 30
days, as applicable. Funds reimbursed to students are reimbursed via the original payment method; i.e., payments
received via credit card are refunded (less non-refundable convenience fee) to the card used for payment, and payments
received via check are refunded via check or direct deposit. To set up your preferred check refund method, please
access the ‘Select Refund Method’ link available on the ‘My Account’ page in the Student portal. In the case of financial
aid recipients, WGU is required to return unearned financial aid to the appropriate grant or loan program based on the
Return of Title IV Financial Aid funds calculation, and as a result of this calculation, students may owe WGU a portion of
tuition and fees not covered.
All funding sources (i.e., internal and external scholarships, waivers, discounts and grants) will be reviewed and may be
subject to a proration calculation. In the case of third-party funds (i.e., employer contributions, government funding,
military payments, etc.), if the payment exceeds tuition and fees, WGU will follow any instructions provided by the original
payer for the appropriate handling of the refund. If no instructions are provided, the refund will be processed to the
original payer. Students are responsible for any portion of the tuition and fees owed, after refunds to all payers.
Note: For Missouri residents, the application fee is refundable if the applicant terminates the admission process by
notifying the Enrollment or Admissions Department within three business days of paying the application fee. The
resource fee is billed at the beginning of each term and is refundable if the student terminates enrollment within three
business days of the start of the term. After three business days, these fees are non-refundable.
Billing and Account Statements
A WGU student account billing notice is generated each time a charge or a charge adjustment is applied to a student
account. Billing notices are delivered to myWGU student email accounts. Students may download account statements
via the student portal by visiting the Student Support tab in the student portal. Select Financial Services on the left and
click ''My Account.'' Scroll to the bottom of the My Account screen to download a term account statement, cumulative
account statement, or course cost breakdown.
Past Due Accounts
Tuition for the full term is due by the first day of each term. Any account not paid in full, awarded financial aid funding or
other third-party guarantor, or on an authorized Payment Plan is past due on the second day of the term. Past due
accounts may be placed on financial hold for non-payment. Failure to complete payment or payment arrangements with
WGU or make payment in full may result in administrative withdrawal.
Automatic Enrollment Confirmation/Not Attending Cancellation for Renewal Term Students
Students' tuition for renewal terms is automatically charged on the first day of the term. Thus, if a student will not be
attending a subsequent term, it is necessary for the student to notify their Program Mentor by telephone or email prior to
enrollment for the term. Once the student has completed term enrollment with the Program Mentor, the student will be
liable for charges incurred.
Final Term Students
Students in their final term may be eligible for part time enrollment if they do not have enough required units remaining to
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 27
be full-time. All Students will have their tuition adjusted by the number of competency units enrolled in a term, not by time
attended within a term. For an estimate of prorated tuition, please refer to the student handbook article -
https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Financial-Services/Tuition-Information-for-Part-Time-Enrollment/ta-p/107
Returned Checks
Payment of tuition or fees with a check that is subsequently returned as unpaid from the bank results in a returned check
fee. A student may not satisfy a returned check obligation with a personal check. After two returned checks, WGU will no
longer accept a personal check for payment on a student's account. All future payments must be made via credit card
(which will incur a 2.85% convenience fee) or money order. Failure to clear a returned check taken in payment for tuition
or fees results in administrative withdrawal from WGU. Once this action is taken, students cannot be reinstated for the
term, but will owe prorated portion of the charges for tuition in addition to other collection costs and charges necessary
for the collection of the returned check. A student may apply for re-enrollment for the following term when all balances
are resolved.
Delinquent Accounts
Failure to meet financial obligations of any kind to the university may result in a financial hold and suspension of future
services including enrollment for subsequent terms. In addition, delinquent accounts may be referred to a collection
agency. Students are responsible for additional late payment charges, interest, attorney's fees, other reasonable costs,
and charges necessary for the collection of any amount not paid when due.
Student Financial Aid Requirements
http://www.wgu.edu/tuition_financial_aid/financial_aid
WGU is approved by the U.S. Department of Education to offer federal student aid in most of our programs. Because of
our more affordable tuition, WGU students are able to graduate without large amounts of student debt to repay. If
students qualify for and accept federal student aid, it will cover most, if not all, direct education expenses. Financial aid
can be used for tuition and fees (including electronic learning materials), textbooks, technology, room and board. A
complete list of allowable expenses is listed in the Cost of Attendance Policy.
To receive consideration for any federal student aid program, students must first file the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) at https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa. When students fill out the FAFSA, they are applying
for aid for a specific year; therefore, they will need to renew the FAFSA application each award year.
Most WGU students qualify for at least one type of federal aid. To be eligible for federal student aid (grants, loans, and
work-study funds), students must meet the following requirements established by the U.S. Department of Education:
• demonstrate financial need (for most programs);
• be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen;
• have a valid Social Security number (with the exception of students from the Republic of the Marshall Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, or the Republic of Palau);
• be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student in an eligible program;
• be enrolled at least half-time to be eligible for Direct Loan Program funds;
• maintain satisfactory academic progress;
• sign the certification statement on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) form stating that you
are not in default on a federal student loan, you do not owe money on a federal student grant, and you will use
federal student aid only for educational purposes; and
• show you’re qualified to obtain a college education by
◦ having a high school diploma or a recognized equivalent such as a General Educational Development
(GED) certificate;
◦ completing a high school education in a homeschool setting approved under state law (or—if state law
does not require a homeschooled student to obtain a completion credential—completing a high school
education in a homeschool setting that qualifies as an exemption from compulsory attendance
requirements under state law); or
◦ enrolling in an eligible career pathway program and meeting one of the ''ability-to-benefit'' alternatives
described at https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements#ability-to-benefit.

Satisfactory Academic Progress
https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Requirements/Satisfactory-Academic-Progress-SAP/ta-p/140
Federal regulations require that all students who receive federal student aid funds maintain satisfactory academic
progress (SAP). It is a measure of student progress toward the completion of a degree and is assessed by qualitative
(grade-based) and quantitative (time-based) measures. WGU evaluates these measures at the end of each completed
payment period or term in the student's academic program and at the time of withdrawal from the university.
The university defines demonstrating a competency (a grade of ''pass'') as a grade equivalent to a ''B'' or better (3.0 on a
4-point scale). WGU does not calculate a GPA. Students receive a mark of ''pass'' or ''not passed'' on their permanent
academic record for any courses for which they enroll in a term, regardless of whether they attempt an assessment. A
course with a grade of ''not passed'' or ''withdrawn'' is considered as a failed course and is counted against SAP.
A quantitative measure is the completion of 66.67% of all competency units attempted. This percentage is determined by
dividing the number of competency units completed by the total number of units for which a student enrolled cumulatively
over the student's academic career at WGU. Completing at least 66.67% of all competencies means the student is on
track to complete the program within the required 150% of the published length of the program measured in competency
units.
Maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress
To maintain good standing for SAP, students must complete at least one course in each term and achieve an overall
minimum cumulative pass rate of 66.67% for all competency units attempted and completed.
The Higher Education Act requires a specific qualitative review at the end of the student's second academic year.
Students enrolled in a program of more than two academic years must have at least a ''C'' or its equivalent, or have an
academic standing consistent with WGU’s graduation requirements. In addition, a student is ineligible when it becomes
mathematically impossible for the student to complete their program within 150% of the length of the program.
Transfer Credits from Other Institutions
Students who are granted transfer credits to WGU that count toward the student's current grade level are included in both
attempted and completed when measuring SAP.
First-Term Critical Actions
New students at WGU who do not complete one of the defined ''first-term critical actions'' within 45 days from the first
term start date will be administratively withdrawn. WGU excludes this term from the SAP calculation. For more
information on first-term critical actions, see the student handbook - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Technical-
Requirements/First-Term-Critical-Actions/ta-p/11989.
Program Change
A change in program of study will not affect a student's SAP standing provided the new program is in the same grade
level as the old program and transfer credit is not added or removed. Students requesting readmission into WGU will
return with the SAP status calculated at the time of withdrawal unless the student requests a program change, or WGU
awards or removes additional transfer credit as aligns with the program transfer credit guidelines. If the Credential Level
of the new program is different from the old program (e.g., Bachelor's degree program into Master's degree program or
vice versa), the student will begin as a first term student with a new SAP history.
For more information on program changes, grade changes, multiple programs, and stacked degree and credential
programs, please refer to the student handbook using the SAP link above.
Financial Aid Warning
Students are required to complete at least one course and achieve a cumulative completion rate of at least 66.67% at the
end of each term.
Students who fail to maintain SAP are placed on warning and may be terminated from federal financial aid eligibility
according to the following criteria:
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 29
• Students who finish their term with a cumulative SAP of less than 66.67% and do not complete at least one course
for the first time are placed on a warning status for the subsequent term but remain eligible for financial aid.
• Students in a warning term who complete at least one course and achieve a cumulative completion rate of at least
66.67% are returned to good academic standing.
Students who are terminated from financial aid eligibility may continue their studies at WGU but are required to self-pay
and make payment arrangements through the Student Accounts office.
In the case of extenuating circumstances, students may appeal their termination status to the Financial Aid Appeal
Committee. Please refer to the student handbook (see SAP link above) for instructions regarding financial aid termination
and appeal, financial aid probation, and financial aid reinstatement.
Student Notification
The university notifies students of the results of any SAP evaluation affecting the eligibility for FSA funds for the entire
payment period.
Scholarship and Grant Recipients
Most scholarships and grants do not allow for a warning term. Failure to meet SAP in any given term can result in
termination of scholarship or grant funds. Please refer to the scholarship or grant materials or contact the scholarship
department at scholarships@wgu.edu for additional information.
Scholarships
Scholarship awards issued by Western Governors University are financial awards provided to students to help them meet
a portion of their tuition costs. Awards are limited to the amount of each scholarship, and depending on the amount, the
scholarship may or may not cover all tuition and fees. Students are responsible for paying any tuition charges not
covered by their scholarship. Unused scholarship monies will not be refunded to students.
Scholarship terms - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Financial-Services/Scholarship-Terms-and-Conditions/ta-p/67
Scholarship list - https://www.wgu.edu/financial-aid-tuition/scholarships.html
Refund and Cancellation Policy
https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Registration-Student-Records/Institutional-Withdrawal-Refund-Policy/ta-p/87
Students who withdraw within three business days from their first term start date are eligible for a full refund including all
tuition and fees paid, minus the student’s application fee.
The following students are eligible for a refund of a prorated portion of tuition:
• Students who have an effective withdrawal date after three business days from their first term start date, but
before the completion of 60% of a term.
• Students who are in any term other than their first term and have an effective withdrawal date before completion of
60% of a term.
Students with a withdrawal date occurring after 60% of the term is completed are not eligible for a refund. The admission
application fee, resource fee, and program specific fees are non-refundable for effective withdrawal occurring after the
first three business days of a student’s first term start date.
Determining Withdrawal Dates
Withdrawal dates are determined in two ways, either through official withdrawal or through administrative withdrawal.
Official withdrawal is a student’s voluntary withdrawal due to inability to continue their studies at WGU regardless of the
cause of such inability. Administrative withdrawal is the involuntary dismissal from WGU due to failure to meet academic
or other requirements.
Official withdrawal: The withdrawal date is the date a student notifies the university of their final decision for withdrawal.
Administrative withdrawal: The withdrawal date is the last date of the student’s academic activity within an enrolled term.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 30
Calculating the Refund
WGU will calculate the refund for students who withdraw pursuant to the policies listed above in this section using the
following formula:
• The number of calendar days from the official term start date to the withdrawal date, divided by the total number of
calendar days in the term.
• WGU calculates the amount of the tuition refund by multiplying tuition billed for the term (less any tuition
discounts) by the percentage of the term the student was not enrolled, and subtracting the amount of tuition
already paid. For example, a student who withdraws halfway (50%) through a term and has paid $2000 of a $3000
total tuition charge would be entitled to a refund of $500 (($3000 * 50%) - $2000 = $500)).
• The resource fee and other program specific fees are non-refundable.
Refunds
Once WGU calculates tuition charges and determines eligibility for a refund, the Bursar office processes refunds within
30 days as applicable. In the case of financial aid recipients, WGU is required to return unearned financial aid to the
appropriate grant or loan program based on the Return of Title IV Financial Aid funds calculation. As a result of this
calculation, students may owe WGU a portion of tuition and fees. Refund methods default to a mailed check. Students
are encouraged to set up their preferred refund method.
All funding sources (i.e., internal and external scholarships, waivers, discounts and grants) will be reviewed and may be
subject to a proration calculation. In the case of third-party funds, i.e., employer contributions, government funding,
military payments, etc., if the payment exceeds tuition and fees, WGU will follow any instructions provided by the original
payer for the appropriate handling of the refund. If no instructions are provided, the refund will be processed to the
original payer. Students are responsible for any portion of the tuition and fees owed, after refunds to all payers.
Tuition Appeal
In the case of exceptional circumstances where students are not entitled to a refund under the policies outlined above,
students may make an appeal for tuition considerations by submitting a formal complaint containing a written explanation
of circumstances that warrant an exception to the published refund policy. Exceptional circumstances might include
incapacitating illness or injury. Supporting documentation to verify exceptional circumstances is required. Disciplinary
action imposed on a student due to violations of the Code of Student Conduct is not considered valid grounds for tuition
appeal. For more information, visit https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Student-Complaint-and-
Grievance-Policy/ta-p/194.

Academic Policies
Credit Transfer Guidelines
https://www.wgu.edu/admissions/transfers.html
WGU does not grant credit for prior training or experience. However, students who enter with significant experience in
their field of study may be able to pass some of the required WGU assessments on an accelerated schedule. Transfer
guidelines are described below in excerpts from the WGU website and Student Handbook.
General Transfer Guidelines
Students that have taken courses or received a degree from a community college or another college or university are
likely already well on their way to a WGU degree. Students can almost always transfer credits when they send accredited
bachelor's or associate degree transcripts.
WGU offers a free transcript service to help students gather and submit transcripts. During the application, students will
be asked if they would like to opt-in to this service, and have their transcripts gathered and sent from participating
institutions.
For applicants that opt out of the free transcript service or if a school does not participate, official transcripts should be
mailed directly from transferring colleges to the WGU Transcripts Department. A student’s copy of their transcript is not
considered official unless it is sealed. Applicants should order official transcripts promptly, as they can take a few weeks
to arrive. Transcripts should be received by the fifth of the month prior to the intended start date.
The process for requesting and sending transcripts from previously attended institutions is described on the WGU
website: https://www.wgu.edu/admissions/transfers/transfer-to-wgu.html.
In order to have WGU complete an official transcript evaluation, applicants must complete the online application form,
pay the application fee, have a WGU issued ID, and WGU must have received official transcripts from the institution(s) at
which the applicant earned the credit or applicants must work with their Enrollment Counselor to mark their previously
attended institutions as not expected/excluded.
In order to ensure that WGU grants all transfer credit that the applicant is due and places the applicant appropriately in
their program, WGU recommends that applicants submit all transcripts from their previously attended institutions. WGU
does not perform unofficial evaluations or accept unofficial transcripts. WGU does not award transfer credit after the
student’s initial term start date, once a student begins studies at WGU.
Applicants may transfer credit up to and not exceeding 75 percent of their program. WGU determines the maximum
amount of credit an applicant may be able to transfer on a programmatic basis.
WGU conducts official transcript evaluations during the month prior to the applicant’s start date. WGU processes
transcripts in the order it receives them. Applicants should contact their Enrollment Counselor if it has been more than 15
business days since WGU received their transcripts and the applicant does not have a completed evaluation.
For more information on transfer policies, see https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Undergraduate-
Transfer-Credit/ta-p/49140.
For specific program transfer guidelines, see https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines.
Transferring from a Community College
WGU maintains relations with many community colleges throughout the United States. Students transferring from a U.S.
community college can expect a comprehensive transfer policy. Information about community college transfers is
available at https://www.wgu.edu/admissions/transfers/transfer-to-wgu.html and https://partners.wgu.edu.
Transferring from WGU
WGU students who may be interested in transferring to another institution, either before or after completing their studies
at WGU, should keep in mind the following points:
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 32
• All institutions reserve the right to determine their own transfer policies, and not all academic work completed at
one institution may transfer to another.
• Students should check the transfer policies at the institution or institutions they are considering by consulting with
the admissions or registrar office at those institution(s).
• Students who transfer should request that the WGU registrar send an official academic transcript of their WGU
transfer credits and academic work to the institution(s) where they are applying for admission.
• The WGU academic transcript will note subject areas (domains) that were successfully completed. WGU transfer
credits and equivalencies for the completed domains will be listed.
For more information, see https://www.wgu.edu/admissions/transfers/wgu-transcript-request.html.
Term Registration and Enrollment
WGU starts a new term on the first day of every month and the duration is six calendar months in length. Students may
only be enrolled in a single term and are considered enrolled and active once term enrollment has been established.
Students register prior to a term by working with their Program Mentor to set a plan of courses to be completed. Students
then accept enrollment for the term on or after the first day of the new term. The term enrollment process is important
because by accepting enrollment, the student is agreeing to pay tuition in full, complete the courses by the end of the
term, and adhere to the Academic Activity Policy.
As part of the term planning process, the student will complete the course planning tool for each course for which they
are planning to register. During term registration, the student and Program Mentor will use the course planning tool
report, as well as information about the student's schedule and needs, to make a Term Plan that includes start and end
dates for each course in the term. The student will select these dates with their Program Mentor to help set a pace that
will ensure the student can complete the enrolled courses by the end of the term. Because starting courses in a timely
fashion is essential to staying on pace, each student should work with their Program Mentor to set a Term Plan and
accept enrollment by the 7th day of each term.
Term enrollment must be completed no later than the 10th day of the start of the term for continuing students and the
20th day of the start of the term for new students. Students who do not complete registration and enrollment for the new
term by these deadlines are administratively withdrawn from the university. First term students must also complete one of
the First Term Critical Actions within 45 days of the start of their first term to avoid administrative withdrawal. Once term
enrollment is established, students are considered enrolled for the term and are responsible for tuition charges. Once
students have enrolled in a term, they are committed to the courses and changes to enrollment will not be processed.

First Term Critical Actions - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Requirements/First-Term-Critical-Actions/ta-p/11989
Working Ahead or Accelerating Courses
Students may accelerate their studies by adding additional courses from their active program to their current terms once
they have successfully completed all term requirements (original term enrollment). Students who choose to add
additional courses to a term should discuss course acceleration in detail with their Program Mentor. Students should
complete the course planning tool for a course before accelerating the course.
Marks of Not Passed
Students are responsible for making sure they complete all courses for which they are enrolled in a term. A mark of Not
Passed becomes part of the permanent academic record and transcript for all enrolled courses that are not attempted,
not completed and not passed. A mark of Not Passed will count against satisfactory academic progress. Refer to the
Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Policy and the Incomplete Course Policy. A student’s academic history will not be
altered due to changes in program or course updates. Any changes or updates to the degree plan due to a program
change or course change does not negate the student’s responsibility to complete all courses in term enrollment.
Courses appearing on the transcript as Not Passed will not be altered should a student decide to pursue a program
change or course update. Some academic changes may result in a permanent unresolved not passed on a student’s
academic history and WGU transcript.

Passing Vendor Assessments/Certifications not Enrolled in Current Term
Students who attempt and pass a course with a vendor assessment(s)/certification(s) without enrolling in that course in
the term shall receive the grade of ‘Requirement Satisfied’ (RS). Students who attempt a course-related vendor
assessment(s)/certification(s), or take any other third-party assessment (e.g. PRAXIS) without course enrollment and/or
referral through WGU’s assessment scheduling procedures will not have the cost of the exam/voucher(s) paid nor
reimbursed by WGU.
Attendance Policy
WGU does not have an institutional attendance policy. Progress is governed by successfully completing assessments
that demonstrate mastery of the required competencies. Students engage in a variety of learning resources to build
competence and prepare for the assessments. In most cases, these learning materials are independent learning
resources such as textbooks, e-learning modules, study guides, simulations, virtual labs, and tutorials.
Communication Plan
WGU programs are designed for students to have timely, intentional interactions with faculty. A personalized
communication and support plan outlines when and how students will interact with faculty and other members of the
Community of Care at WGU. The information below explains the faculty support students will have and how they will
create and modify a personalized communication and support plan to help them stay on track to meet their goals.
WGU is dedicated to student success and wants students to have the faculty support they need when they need it.
Program Mentors and Instructors will provide regular and proactive personalized support based on a student’s needs.
Students and their Program Mentor will collaborate to incorporate individual needs and goals into the academic plan.
Program Mentors help students reach their educational goals by providing support with
• academic planning and pacing,
• coaching through obstacles, and
• instruction that connects program competencies to career goals.
Instructors provide personalized course pacing, planning, and instructional support throughout each course. Students
and Instructors will collaborate to help students
• build course-based competency,
• implement course-specific success strategies, and
• progress through each course according to the personalized academic plan.
A critical component to success at WGU is the personalized communication and support plan. Students and their
Program Mentor will use the student’s goals, activities, learning, and academic progress to build a plan for faculty
interaction that supports timely engagement and progress.
Working toward a degree is exciting, but for most students, it's also a journey that will take a year or more. Students are
more likely to achieve a big, long-term goal when they identify regular, periodic milestones along the way. WGU students
are most successful when they make steady progress throughout each term, and the communication and support plan
will help students stay on track. By collaborating with faculty members, students maximize their ability to succeed in
multiple ways:
• They will always know the most efficient and effective path forward, so they don't waste time trying to figure out
what to do next.
• They will build a solid network of expert partners who can help them navigate any challenges that come up.
• They will get their money's worth by taking full advantage of all the support and resources their tuition pays for.
At the start of each term, students will work with their Program Mentor to create a personalized communication and
support plan. When they create their plan with their Program Mentor, they will identify when and how they will interact
with their Program Mentor, Instructors, and other members of the Community of Care as needed. The frequency, timing,
and format of interactions in any term will depend on the student’s goals, progress, and individual needs. Throughout the
term, students and their Program Mentor will review the communication and support plan to make sure it is still helping
them progress toward their goals and engage regularly in their studies. As students learn what works well for them and
what support they need, they will modify the plan as needed. The communication and support plan is personalized to the
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 34
student, so it won't be the same as another student's plan. The best plan is the one that helps students make consistent
progress, demonstrate regular academic activity, and meet their academic goals.
More information on the Communication Plan is available in the student handbook - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Information-
Resources/Communication-Plan/ta-p/99.
Academic Progress
Western Governors University helps students achieve their dreams for a degree and career success by providing a
personalized, flexible, and affordable education based upon real-world competencies. WGU takes an active interest in
students' progress through their academic programs and requires students to make measurable advancement toward
completion of their degree program each term. With this in mind, the university has established the following policies:
On-Time Progress (OTP): Students completing within the term, a minimum of 12 competency units (CUs) at the
undergraduate level, and 8 competency units at the graduate level, are considered to be making on-time progress toward
graduation.
Lack of Progress: WGU will administratively withdraw a student from the university at the end of any period consisting of
two consecutive terms where zero CUs were completed. WGU does not include terms during which a student is not
actively enrolled in a course(s) in its calculation of consecutive terms. Completing CUs in a term or graduating from a
program resets the measure of consecutive terms.
Academic Progress Appeals: If a student desires to be considered for continued enrollment after completing zero
cumulative CUs within two consecutive terms, the student must submit an appeal. Appeals must be received within the
appeal window (see link below). Students who fail to appeal within the designated time frame or whose appeal is denied
may be eligible to return via the standard readmission process. WGU does not guarantee continued enrollment or
readmission. A student with one term of zero CUs is not required to submit an appeal to remain enrolled as students are
not at risk for administrative withdrawal under this policy until they have reached two consecutive zero CU terms.
Academic Progress and Appeals - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Academic-Progress/ta-p/52
Withdrawal from WGU - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-Student-Policy-Handbook/Withdrawal-from-WGU/ta-p/84
Readmission Following Withdrawal - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Admission/Readmission-Following-Withdrawal/ta-p/143
Academic Activity Policy
In addition to the requirements of the Academic Progress policy, students are expected to demonstrate consistent
engagement with their studies throughout each academic term. Activities demonstrating academic engagement include:
• Discussion of course content with an Instructor
• Live academic conversation with a Program Mentor
• Completing course planning tools
• Activating a course by clicking the Start Course button
• Completing pre-assessments
• Completing objective assessments
• Submitting a performance assessment task for evaluation
• Attending a faculty-led live event, such as a webinar
• Use of course learning resources
• Viewing recorded faculty-led live events
• Viewing a course-related academic video
Students who are not academically engaged for a period of 14 days may be required to meet with their Program Mentor
to develop a plan for the immediate resumption of their studies, to include reengagement with course learning resources
and/or meeting with an Instructor. Students who demonstrate 28 days of inactivity will be subject to administrative
withdrawal. An academically inactive student will be notified prior to withdrawal.
First-Term Critical Actions
First-Term Critical Actions are academic activities that are highly correlated with student success in the first term (and
each successive term). *New students accordingly, are required to engage in at least one of the following academic
activities in at least one registered course during the first 45 days of their first term:
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 35
• Completion of a Preassessment
• Completion of an Objective Assessment
• Submission of a Performance Assessment Task
Note: If a performance assessment task is returned without an evaluation (as expressed in a comment accompanying the
returned task), the submission does not count as a Critical Action. If an evaluation is completed, the submission will
count as a Critical Action whether the submission passes or is returned for revision. If a task is subject to an Academic
Authenticity evaluation, a case-by-case determination may occur on whether the submission will count.
*Readmission students or Continuing Graduates are not considered new students and this policy does not apply.
Students who do not complete at least one of the requirements listed above will be administratively withdrawn after the
45th day and will receive a prorated tuition refund in accordance with WGU’s Refund Policy. Any activity that occurs
before the first day of the term or after the 45th day cannot be considered a Critical Action. Students administratively
withdrawn under this policy will receive the transcript notation of ''Dropped'' on all registered courses.
Students will receive multiple email notifications if they are approaching the Critical Action deadline. Appeal information is
available at https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Academic-Requirements/First-Term-Critical-Actions/ta-p/11989.
WGU Grading System
WGU Transcripts include the following possible marks:
• Pass: Certifies successful completion of a course of study. A student has demonstrated required competencies by
passing the final assessment with a grade equivalent of B or better or 3.00 grade points on a 4.00 scale.
• Not Passed: Indicates the student did not complete the required assessment(s) to demonstrate competency
before the end of the term.
• Requirement Satisfied: Recognizes that a student has satisfied the requirements of a course of study through
alternate coursework that may not be directly transferred.
• Transfer: Signifies that the student has completed equivalent coursework or holds certifications or licenses that
comply with WGU transfer credit policies.
• Withdrawn: Represents that the student was withdrawn from WGU or a course before term completion.
• Dropped: Verifies that the course was dropped from term registration and is not included in attempted units.
• Incomplete: Indicates an arrangement between WGU and the student to complete the course before an agreed
upon, later date. The student has not completed the entirety of the coursework and/or the final assessment has
been deferred.
• In Progress: Indicates a course was not completed within the term because the course, by design, requires a fixed
period of time, more than one term to be completed, and/or is not intended to be bound by the term structure of
WGU.
The university does not calculate a grade point average (GPA), but its grading scheme means students receive between
a 3.0 and 4.0 on a 4.0-scale.
WGU enters grades on transcripts upon completion of a course of study. A course of study In Progress will not appear on
the transcript until the end of a Term. Students receive a grade of Pass, Not Passed, In Progress, Dropped or Withdrawn
on their permanent academic record and transcript for any course(s) of study for which they enroll in a Term, regardless
of whether they attempt an assessment. WGU will not replace an earned Pass or Not Passed with a grade of Withdrawn.
WGU counts grades of Not Passed and Withdrawn as units not completed and, as such, these grades count against
satisfactory academic progress.
Degree Plan
The degree plan, accessed via the my.wgu.edu student portal, serves as a student's blueprint of program requirements
(often called the standard path) and associated learning resources. The degree plan outlines a student's course and non-
course requirements in their program and allows students and Program Mentors to work together in planning the path to
graduation. The degree plan displays the course details (including course name, course code, complete or not yet
complete status, number of competency units, and the assessment type) and start and end dates for registered courses.
The student degree plan lists the courses of study, including assessments, required to complete an academic program.
Students access learning resources and make requests to schedule Objective Assessments or begin Performance
Assessments inside the online version of a course of study.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 36
The standard path through a student's degree plan may be adjusted by the student and Program Mentor to meet the
student's individual needs during term enrollment. Some programs allow substantial reordering of the standard path, but
others do not allow any modification.
WGU starts a new term on the first day of every month. Each term is six calendar months in duration. Students may not
be enrolled in multiple terms simultaneously. A student may not enroll in a new term until at least six months after the
start of their most recent enrolled term. A student who graduates, changes programs, or withdraws from WGU will not be
able to start a new term until at least six months after the start date of their most recent enrolled term.
Once term enrollment is complete courses shall not be removed except with the approval of the Office of the Registrar.
Students may add courses to the term in accordance with the Accelerated Courses policy (https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-
Student-Policy-Handbook/Accelerated-Courses/ta-p/18850).
By registering for a course, the student agrees to work on and complete the course within the term. Students should be
prepared to engage in and pass all courses for which they enroll. A course that is not passed by the end of the term will
be listed as ''Not Passed'' on the academic transcript. This includes courses for which the student did not attempt the
assessment by the end of the term.
Term enrollment should take place within the first ten days of the start of a new term. Students must be enrolled at least
full time (12 competency units for undergraduate students and 8 for graduate students). Students who do not complete
full-time registration and enrollment for the new term by the 25th of the first month of their term are administratively
withdrawn from WGU.

assessments, visit https://www.wgu.edu/admissions/student-experience/assessments.html.
Courses of Study
The degree plan lists the courses of study required to complete an academic program. A course of study is comprised of
five important aspects:
• Defined competencies students are required to demonstrate
• Learning resources needed to gain the competencies
• Contact information for Instructors to support student development of the competencies
• A learning community centered on the competencies
• The assessments of the competencies
Each course of study is assigned a number of competency units (CUs).
Learning Unit
One (1) competency unit (CU) is equivalent to one (1) semester credit of learning. A CU is the value assigned to each
assessment to permit tracking of academic progress. Traditional classroom learning is based on the Carnegie Unit where
a credit hour is the equivalent of one clock hour of learning (generally considered 50 lecture minutes) per week over the
course of a 15-week semester. WGU competency units (CUs) are equivalent to semester hours at other institutions. For
example, one (1) CU equals one (1) semester hour of credit. In other terms, using the metric of three (3) semester hours
equaling 45 clock hours, one (1) CU is the equivalent of 15 clock hours. This equivalency has been accepted by our
external regulators and by other universities (for transfer of credits). WGU transcripts show the number of CUs assigned
to each course.
Term Enrollment
Term enrollment is the process of choosing courses and verifying enrollment for the term of study. During term
enrollment, students and their Program Mentor will map out which assessments to complete and the time frame in which
to do so by established start and end dates. Program Mentors will schedule at least the minimum number of competency
units required for full-time enrollment (12 units for undergraduate students, 8 units for graduate students). On-time
progress is based on how term enrollment is set each term.
Start and End Dates
To help students plan their progress through the term and to set a study schedule and calendar, students and their
Program Mentors will set start and end dates for each course. With these dates, students can plan how to accelerate or
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 37
where to spend more time in getting ready to demonstrate competency in an assessment area.
Computer Requirements
Students should use the following technical requirements to guide their selection of a technology package for use during
their academic program at WGU. Systems purchased new within the past two years will typically come with the following
recommended features. Students can check the technical readiness of their computer system by using the WGU System
Check tool to ensure they meet university requirements.

Requirements/Computer-System-and-Technology-Requirements/ta-p/78).
Additional Technology and Software Recommendations
WGU requires students to use several third-party learning resources. System requirements for these resources vary
widely by program and assessment and may differ significantly from those listed above. Information Technology
students, in particular, may need to install applications requiring a more powerful computer or a specific operating
system. If students are concerned that their computer may not meet the minimum requirements for any third-party
learning resource or specific application in their degree program, they should contact Student Support Services.
Student Accessibility Services
https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Student-Services/Policies-and-Procedures-for-Students-with-Disabilities/ta-p/151
Western Governors University is committed to providing equal access to its academic programs to all qualified students.
The University’s Student Accessibility Services supports this commitment by providing support, resources, advocacy,
collaboration, and academic accommodations that conform to federal and state statutes and regulations.
WGU complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the ''ADA''), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other
applicable disability discrimination laws. WGU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation(s) to qualified
disabled applicants and learners in WGU programs and activities as required by applicable law.
The determination of reasonable accommodation(s) for qualified students with disabilities, and compliance with the ADA
and the Rehabilitation Act, are the responsibility of WGU Student Accessibility Services. Student Accessibility Services is
the principal point of contact for all students with disability questions or concerns (ADAsupport@wgu.edu).
WGU encourages current and prospective students needing accommodation(s) and/or resources to contact Student
Accessibility Services for assistance. Student Accessibility Services will respond to requests for accommodation(s) in
accordance with the Policies and Procedures for Students with Disabilities published in the student handbook.
WGU complies with applicable laws concerning the confidentiality of disability-related health information and it is
committed to ensuring that all information regarding student health remains appropriately confidential; only Student
Accessibility Services has access to student health information. Student Accessibility Services retains student health and
accommodation information for the length of a student’s enrollment at WGU. If a student wishes to have a record deleted
during their enrollment, they must send a written request to Student Accessibility Services. Students may authorize the
release of disability information to people or organizations outside of WGU. Before providing such authorization, students
should understand the nature of the information to be released and the purpose. WGU may infrequently be required by
law to disclose disability information without student consent.
Student Complaint Process
The student complaint policy provides guidance on proper avenues for addressing university-related concerns. A
complaint is an expression of dissatisfaction arising from a student’s experience with or treatment by university personnel
or policies. A grievance is a complaint based on a perceived unfairness or discrimination. Academic and financial appeals
(i.e. issues related to competency assessments, academic progress, academic outcomes, financial aid, payments, etc.)
are NOT considered complaints and should be handled through the processes published by the relevant departments.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 39
Please see the student handbook article on Academic and Financial Appeals Information for a listing of university
appeals processes (https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Student-Rights-Responsibilities/Academic-and-Financial-Appeals-
Information/ta-p/19084).
If a complaint involves any type of alleged discrimination or harassment in violation of the WGU Equal Opportunity,
Harassment, and Nondiscrimination Policy and Grievance Processes or the student wishes to remain anonymous, the
student or any other offended party may immediately make a formal complaint to the Title IX Coordinator per the process
outlined in the policy or through Speak Up WGU™.

Academic Authenticity
Academic Authenticity is fundamental to the educational process and the assurance of credential integrity at Western
Governors University (WGU). WGU holds that respect for ideas and intellectual property rights is critical to academic
success. Therefore, this policy establishes the expectations and standards of Academic Authenticity for WGU students.
This policy applies to all WGU students regardless of location.
Academic Authenticity means the ethical completion of WGU coursework. Examples include appropriately attributing text,
pictures, tables, and graphs used in coursework to the creators and each student completing their own coursework,
including not submitting work generated by artificial intelligence (AI) as the student’s own work.
All members of the WGU community share the responsibility of ensuring that community members, particularly students,
observe the authentic expression of ideas. Examples of Academic Authenticity include but are not limited to:
• Attributing text, pictures, tables, and graphs used in coursework to their creators.
• Giving credit to all sources used, including WGU-provided course materials and the student’s own work used as a
source.
• Appropriately paraphrasing and/or synthesizing sources.
• Completing assessments independently and honestly to verify individual competency.
WGU expects all students to abide by the following requirements related to Academic Authenticity:
Intellectual Property
• Students may not use any WGU assessment answers or other assessment content found, requested, shared, or
purchased on the internet (or elsewhere) to complete their own work. This includes, but is not limited to, using
answers to assessment questions or projects completed by someone else and passing, or attempting to pass,
those answers and projects off as the students’ own work.
• Similarly, active students may not share responses to assessments or projects, including by uploading work on
tutoring websites or social media, except as authorized by specific programs for portfolio-building purposes.
• Students may not copy, record, or disclose WGU assessment, course, project, or learning materials to anyone
else. This includes copying for personal use and disclosing on websites, blogs, and other social media. Students’
final work-product developed in relation to projects may fall under the portfolio exception listed below.
• Students may use capstone projects as source materials so long as they properly cite the source. However,
students may not use any previously completed capstone project from another WGU degree or another institution
as the final submission of a capstone project for a different degree program in which the student is currently
enrolled.
• Students may consent to have their capstone work archived for restricted view by other students and alumni. They
may also use and repurpose their capstone and other performance tasks for use when they graduate as an
electronic portfolio in furtherance of their professional careers or as an achievement on an academic resume, with
care not to violate rules above.
• Any sources used by students in their coursework must be academic in nature and cited properly.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 40
Assessments
• Unless official WGU instructions direct otherwise, assessments and projects must be the student’s own individual
work. Students shall not engage in unauthorized collaborative efforts in the creation, completion, submission, or
revision of assessments. This includes working with other students or using AI-generated content unless official
WGU instructions direct otherwise. All students must demonstrate competency in their own work.
• With the exception of capstone archives, students may not read, or review completed assessments for the
purpose of generating thought, comparing how other students addressed the task, reviewing references, or any
other reason.
• Students shall not falsify or misrepresent information submitted to meet the requirement of any assessment.
• Objective Assessment:
◦ WGU may record all proctored objective assessments. When taking a proctored WGU assessment, the
student may not access any device or material not specifically approved in advance nor communicate with
anyone except the proctor. This includes, but is not limited to: highlighting material during the assessment,
running unapproved software or programs, and accessing the internet to search for related materials or
definitions.
◦ Students shall not read questions aloud.
◦ All audio and video equipment must be in working order.
◦ WGU requires the student, including hands and arms, to remain in the view of the proctor at all times.
Performance Assessment
• If students use material from any appropriate source, the student must provide attribution to that source. Examples
of appropriate sources include, but are not limited to, course-provided content, books, scholarly journals, and
online encyclopedias. Students found to be in violation may be subject to sanctions.
• Students must only submit files that WGU can scan through the Similarity Checker unless indicated otherwise by
the task directions. Students should only submit handwritten documents and pictures during an Evaluation if the
task directions specifically call for submission of that file type.
• To protect each student’s identity, WGU encourages (but does not require) students to remove all personally
identifiable information, such as phone numbers and addresses, from each submission.
• WGU will store a copy of all submitted work to prevent its use in future submissions.
The Student Code of Conduct defines violations of this policy as ''cheating,'' which is subject to sanctions up to and
including expulsion from WGU. WGU may block student access to assessment scheduling or task submission while an
investigation of alleged violations of this policy is underway.
University procedures relating to Academic Authenticy are listed in the student handbook - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/WGU-
Student-Policy-Handbook/Academic-Authenticity/ta-p/128.
Student Code of Conduct
PURPOSE
Western Governors University (WGU) holds the belief that respect for individuals, ideas, and the authenticity of Student

law.
7. Harassment: Any unwelcome verbal, physical, written, electronic, or non-verbal conduct (whether directly,
indirectly, or through a third party) based on that person’s inclusion in one or more protected classes that is
sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to alter the conditions of employment of an employee or to limit,
interfere with, or deny educational benefits or opportunities of a Student, from both a subjective and objective
viewpoint based on a totality of the circumstances. The circumstances establishing potential Harassment may
include the frequency and severity of the conduct, whether the conduct was physically threatening or humiliating,
the effect of the conduct on the individual’s mental or emotional state, whether the conduct was directed at more
than one person, whether the conduct arose in the context of other discriminatory conduct, and whether the
speech or conduct deserves the protections of academic freedom.

have decision-making authority on all matters assigned to them.
Jurisdiction of Student Code of Conduct
The Student Code of Conduct shall apply to conduct that adversely affects the WGU Community. Each Student shall be
responsible for the Student’s own conduct from the time of application for admission through the actual awarding of a
degree, even though conduct may occur before courses begin or after courses end, during periods between terms of
actual enrollment, or WGU may not discover the conduct until after it has awarded a degree. The Code of Conduct shall
apply to a Student’s conduct even if the Student withdraws from WGU while a disciplinary matter is pending. The Code of
Conduct governs WGU's Community standards, and each Student is bound by this Code of Conduct by virtue of
engaging with WGU coursework, resources, and systems regardless of whether the Student has formally read or
acknowledged it.

Attempts and Complicity. WGU prohibits attempting to commit acts prohibited by the Code of Conduct and/or knowingly
or willfully encouraging or assisting others to commit any of these acts. WGU will adjudicate attempts and complicity in
the same manner as direct violations.
Violation of Law and WGU Discipline. WGU may institute disciplinary proceedings against a Student whose conduct
potentially violates both the criminal law and the Code of Conduct (if both alleged violations result from the same factual
situation) without regard to the pendency of civil or criminal litigation in court or criminal arrest and prosecution.
Proceedings under this Code of Conduct may continue prior to, simultaneously with, or following civil or criminal
proceedings at the discretion of the Student Conduct Manager. Determinations made or sanctions imposed under this
Code of Conduct shall not be subject to change as of result of the dismissal, reduction, or resolution of criminal
complaints arising out of the same facts giving rise to violation of WGU standards.
Any member of the WGU Community may file a complaint against a Student for violations of the Code of Conduct.
PROCEDURES
Complaints and Student Conduct Board Hearings. Individuals must submit an alleged charge(s) in writing to the Student
Conduct Officer in a timely manner (i.e., as soon as is practical and without unnecessary or unreasonable delay) after the
event takes place or they discover the alleged violation. The Student Conduct Board retains the right to review all
documents and information submitted to WGU.
1. The Student Conduct Officer may investigate to determine if the charge(s) has merit and/or if it can be dismissed
administratively by mutual consent of the parties involved and with the approval of the Student Conduct Officer. If
the Student Conduct Officer decides that dismissal for lack of merit is appropriate, the Officer shall deliver a
written explanation of their analysis to the parties to obtain the parties’ consent for dismissal. Such disposition
shall be final and there shall be no subsequent proceedings.
2. If the Accused Student admits to violations described in the complaint, but the parties do not agree on appropriate
sanctions, subsequent procedures, including any hearing, if necessary, shall be limited to determining the
appropriate sanction(s).
3. The Student Conduct Officer, or their designee, shall present all complaints to the Accused Student in written
form. A time shall be set for the Student Conduct Board hearing, not less than five (5) nor more than fifteen (15)
calendar days after the Officer notifies the Student. The Student Conduct Officer, at their discretion, may extend
the maximum time limits for scheduling of Student Conduct Board hearings.
4. Student Conduct Board hearings shall occur virtually in accordance with the following:
◦ Student Conduct Board hearings shall be closed to public attendees.
◦ The Board shall allow the Complainant, Accused Student, and their advisor(s), if any, to attend the entire
portion of the Student Conduct Board hearing at which the Board receives information (excluding
deliberations). Admission of any other person to the Student Conduct Board Hearing shall be at the
discretion of the Student Conduct Board and/or its Student Conduct Officer and limited to only persons
necessary to the proceedings.
◦ In Student Conduct Board hearings involving more than one Accused Student, the Student Conduct Officer,
at their discretion, may determine to conduct the Accused Students’ hearings either separately or jointly.
◦ Upon five (5) days advance written notice to the WGU Conduct Office at conductadmin@wgu.edu, the
Complainant and the Accused Student may choose an advisor to assist them in the proceedings. The
advisor must be a member of the WGU Community and may not be acting in the capacity of an attorney. If
the Complainant and/or the Accused Student fail to provide a minimum of five (5) days’ notice, the Student
Conduct Officer may reschedule the Student Conduct Board hearing.
◦ The Complainant and/or the Accused Student is responsible for representing themselves and presenting
any relevant information at the hearing; therefore, advisors may not speak or participate directly in any
Student Conduct Board hearing. A Student should select as an advisor a person whose schedule allows
attendance at the scheduled date and time for the Student Conduct Board hearing.
◦ The Complainant, the Accused Student, and the Student Conduct Board may arrange for witnesses to
present relevant information to the Student Conduct Board. At the discretion of the Student Conduct Officer,
the Officer will try to arrange the attendance of witnesses who are members of the WGU Community, if the
Complainant and/or Accused Student have identified such witnesses at least five (5) business days prior to
the hearing. Witnesses will provide information to, and answer questions from, the Student Conduct Board.
The Accused Student and/or Complainant may suggest questions for the Board to ask each other or
witnesses. The Board will conduct the questioning with such questions directed to the chairperson, rather
than to the witness directly to preserve the educational tone of the hearing and to avoid creation of an
adversarial environment. The Board chairperson, at their discretion, shall resolve questions of whether the
Board will receive potential information.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 44
◦ At the discretion of the chairperson, the Student Conduct Board may accept any relevant records, exhibits,
and written statements as evidence.
◦ All procedural questions are subject to the final decision of the chairperson of the Student Conduct Board.
◦ After hearing and receiving all relevant evidence, the Student Conduct Board shall determine by consensus
whether the Accused Student has committed the violations as alleged in the complaint.
◦ The Student Conduct Board shall use the preponderance of the evidence standard to make its
determination(s) (i.e., more likely than not that the Accused Student committed the violations as alleged).
◦ Student Code of Conduct proceedings are not subject to formal rules of process, procedure, and/or
technical rules of evidence, such as are applicable in criminal or civil court.
5. There shall be a single record, such as an audio recording (or contemporaneous account) of all Student Conduct
Board hearings; however, there shall be no recording of the Board’s deliberations. The record shall be property of
WGU and become part of the Accused Student’s Disciplinary Record. WGU maintains the record in accordance
with all WGU records retention policies. WGU will keep the record of a suspended or expelled Student indefinitely.
6. If an Accused Student receives appropriate notice and does not attend the Student Conduct Board hearing, the
presentation of information in support of the complaint and Board consideration will proceed even if the Accused
Student is not present.
7. The Student Conduct Board may accommodate concerns for the personal safety, well-being, and/or fears of
confrontation of the Complainant or witnesses during the hearing by permitting participation by separate meeting,
separate telephone line, written statement, or other means, where determined to be appropriate by the Student
Conduct Officer.
Following the Student Conduct Board hearing, the Student Conduct Officer shall advise the Accused Student and the
Complainant in writing of the Board’s determination and of the sanction(s) imposed, if any.
Sanctions: WGU will impose sanctions for violations that the Student Conduct Board determines the Student has
committed. When determining which sanctions to impose, the Student Conduct Board will consider the Student’s history
of misconduct and the severity of the violations. Certain behaviors, such as proxy cheating, are considered egregious
violations of the Code and may warrant expulsion without prior warnings or remediation opportunities. The Student
Conduct Board may direct the Student Conduct Officer to impose any of the following sanctions and may impose more
than one sanction for each violation:
1. Level 1 Warning: A written (email) notice that a Student’s conduct is violating or has violated the Code of Conduct
and the misconduct must cease immediately and not occur again in the future.
2. Level 2 Warning: A written notice indicating that a Student’s conduct is violating or has violated the standards of
conduct including an improvement plan that will demonstrate conduct conforming to the Student Code of Conduct
within a specified period of time. A Level 2 Warning includes the probability of more severe sanctions for any
subsequent violation of the Code of Conduct.
3. Loss of Privileges: A written notice of the denial of specified privileges for a designated period of time.
4. Restitution: An order requiring the Accused Student to compensate relevant parties for loss, damage, or injury.
This may take the form of appropriate service and/or monetary or material replacement.
5. Discretionary Sanctions: Work assignments, essays, service to WGU or other related discretionary assignments.
6. Disciplinary Suspension: Separation of the Student from WGU for a definite length of time, after which the Student
is eligible to return. WGU may specify conditions for readmission.
7. Removal from Academic Program: Removal of the Student from their chosen academic program for behaviors not
conforming to the standards of professional conduct associated with programs leading to professional licensure.
The Student Conduct Board may, at its discretion, suggest one or more alternative academic programs. If the
Student does not accept an alternative program or WGU deems it inappropriate under the circumstances, the
Accused Student will be subject to administrative withdrawal.
8. Disciplinary Expulsion: Permanent separation of the Student from WGU without the possibility of readmission.
9. Revocation of transcript grades and/or assessment results: WGU may amend grades or assessment results that
are part of the Student’s Academic Record.
10. Revocation of Admission and/or Degree: WGU may revoke admission to, or a degree awarded from WGU for
fraud, misrepresentation, or other violation of WGU standards in obtaining the degree, or for other serious
violations a Student committed prior to graduation.
11. Withholding Degree: WGU may withhold awarding a degree otherwise earned until the completion of the process
set forth in this Student Code of Conduct, including the completion of all sanctions imposed, if any.
Documentation of disciplinary expulsion, removal from an academic program, or revocation or withholding of a degree
are part of the Student’s permanent Academic Record. Documentation of other disciplinary sanctions shall not be part of
the Student’s permanent Education Record but shall become part of the Student’s Disciplinary Record. In situations
involving both an Accused Student and a Student claiming to be the victim of the Accused Student’s conduct, WGU
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 45
considers the records of the process and outcomes, if any, to be the education records of both the Accused Student(s)
and the Student(s) claiming to be the victim.
Administrative Holds: If a Student fails to respond to a complaint or complete sanctions as required, the Student Conduct
Office may place an administrative hold on the Student’s Academic Record to ensure cooperation with the disciplinary
process. In most cases, an administrative hold will not prevent a Student from completing coursework in the current term
but will prevent a Student from registering in additional courses, receiving transcripts, or obtaining a degree. Depending
on the severity of the charges, the Conduct Officer may also institute an administrative hold pending the outcome of
proceedings.
Interim Suspension: In certain circumstances, the Student Conduct Manager, or a designee, may impose a WGU
suspension prior to the Student Conduct Board hearing.
1. The Manager may impose interim suspension for the following reasons: (i) to ensure the safety and wellbeing of
members of the WGU Community or preservation of WGU property; (ii) to ensure the Accused Student’s physical
or emotional safety and wellbeing; or (iii) if the Accused Student poses an ongoing threat of disruption of, or
interference with, the normal operations of WGU.
2. As the Student Conduct Manager or the Student Conduct Officer may determine to be appropriate for the
purposes of investigation, an Accused Student may lose access to some or all WGU systems or privileges for
which the Accused Student might otherwise be eligible during the interim suspension.
3. If the Manager determines an interim suspension is appropriate, the interim suspension does not replace the
regular process, which shall proceed as outlined in this Student Code of Conduct, up to and through the Student
Conduct Board hearing.
Appeals: Students have limited right to appeal a decision reached by the Student Conduct Board. The Accused Student
or Complainant may appeal a decision reached by the Student Conduct Board or a sanction imposed by the Student
Conduct Officer to the Appellate Board, in writing, within five (5) business days of notification of the decision. The
appealing party shall deliver the appeal to the Student Conduct Officer or their designee.
1. Except as required to explain the basis of information a party discovered after the Conduct Board hearing, an
appeal is limited to a review of the record of the Student Conduct Board hearing and supporting documents for
one or more of the following purposes:
◦ To determine whether the Student Conduct Board hearing was conducted fairly. Consideration of fairness
shall include the following:
▪ The charges and the information presented to the Student Conduct Board.
▪ The degree of conformance with prescribed procedures which allow the complaining party a
reasonable opportunity to prepare and present information that there was a violation of the Student
Code of Conduct while also allowing the Accused Student a reasonable opportunity to prepare and
present a response to those allegations. Note: Deviation from designated procedures is not a basis
for sustaining an appeal unless significant prejudice resulted from the deviation.
◦ To determine whether the decision reached regarding the Accused Student was based on substantial
information, that is, whether there were facts in the case that, if believed by the fact finder, were sufficient to
establish that a violation of the Student Code of Conduct occurred.
◦ To determine whether the sanction(s) imposed were appropriate for the violation(s) of the Student Code of
Conduct which the Student Conduct Board found the Accused Student to have committed.
◦ To consider new information sufficient to alter a decision or other relevant facts not brought out in the
original hearing because such information and/or facts were not known and were not discoverable by the
appealing party at the time of the original Student Conduct Board hearing.
2. If the Appellate Board grants an appeal, the matter shall return to the original Student Conduct Board and Student
Conduct Officer for reopening of Student Conduct Board hearing to allow reconsideration of the original
determination and/or sanction(s). If the Appellate Board denies an appeal, the decisions and any sanctions of the
Student Conduct Board hearing shall be final and binding on all parties.
Interpretation and Revision: For questions of interpretation or application of the Student Code of Conduct, the Student
Conduct Manager or their designee shall make a final determination.
• Under the direction and discretion of the Student Conduct Manager, WGU shall review the Student Code of
Conduct every two (2) years, or as needed. In the interim, WGU may amend the Code of Conduct at any time
upon appropriate notice to Students. Individuals may suggest revisions to the Student Conduct Officer which an
ad hoc panel, assigned by the Student Conduct Manager, will review, and consider.

Course Descriptions
American Politics and the U.S. Constitution (C963A) - American Politics and the U.S. Constitution examines the evolution
of representative government in the United States and the changing interpretations of the civil rights and civil liberties
protected by the Constitution. This course will give candidates an understanding of the powers of the branches of the
federal government, the continual tensions inherent in a federal system, the shifting relationship between state and
federal governments, and the interactions between elected officials and the ever-changing electorate. This course will
focus on such topics as the role of a free press in a democracy, the impact of changing demographics on American
politics, and the debates over and expansion of civil rights. Upon completion of the course, candidates should be able to
explain the basic functions of the federal government, describe the forces that shape American policy and politics, and be
better prepared to participate in America’s civic institutions.
Applied Algebra (C957A) - Applied Algebra is designed to help you develop competence in working with functions, the
algebra of functions, and using some applied properties of functions. You will start learning about how we can apply
different kinds of functions to relevant, real-life examples. From there, the algebra of several families of functions will be
explored, including linear, polynomial, exponential, and logistic functions. You will also learn about relevant, applicable
mathematical properties of each family of functions, including rate of change, concavity, maximizing/minimizing, and
asymptotes. These properties will be used to solve problems related to your major and make sense of everyday living
problems.
CompTIA IT Fundamentals (ITF1) - This course and its subsequent ITF+ certification serve as the starting point for a
career in information technology (IT) support. Obtaining ITF+ certification will show learners they have the aptitude to
pursue a professional-level certification, such as CompTIA A+. This course will help them work toward a career in
assisting desktop personal computer users. Such job roles include support engineer, maintenance engineer, desktop
engineer, computer administrator, or PC support analyst.
English Composition I (ENG1) - This course is intended for learners who struggle with written communication or like to
write but want to improve. The course illustrates that anyone can become a good writer. But, just like anything that
requires practice, writing is a process. Learners will explore four distinct writing approaches: expressive, narrative,
interpretive, and argumentative. Using these approaches, they will develop writing skills that will benefit them in all
aspects of their lives.
Ethics in Technology (D333A) - Ethics in Technology examines the ethical considerations of technology use in the 21st
century and introduces students to a decision-making process informed by ethical frameworks. Students will study
specific cases related to important topics such as surveillance, social media, hacking, data manipulation, plagiarism and
piracy, artificial intelligence, responsible innovation, and the digital divide.
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 48
Foundations of Coding (D615A) - Successful programmers know how to solve a puzzle. They have the curiosity and
foundational knowledge to write code for countless applications. For students ready to gain that expertise, this course will
introduce them to algorithmic thinking and how to apply it to everyday situations. They will explore key programming
concepts, including flow control, data types, and common data structures. They will also study the organization and
documentation of simple programs. As students progress in this course, they will learn about the major programming
language types and how to develop basic programs in Python. Along the way, they will discover key troubleshooting
strategies and develop a growth mindset so they can overcome any challenges they encounter.
Fundamentals of Information Security (D430A) - This course lays the foundation for understanding terminology,
principles, processes, and best practices of information security at local and global levels. It further provides an overview
of basic security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for protecting information assets through planning and
administrative controls within an organization.
Fundamentals of Spreadsheets and Data Presentations (D388A) - Fundamentals of Spreadsheets and Data
Presentations offers learners an overview of the use of spreadsheet functions and methods for presenting data within
spreadsheets. Learners will have the opportunity to explore features and uses of MS Excel and apply the tools to
situations they may encounter while studying in their program. They will also be introduced to real world uses and tools to
collect, organize and present data.
Fundamentals for Success in Business (D072A) - This introductory course provides students with an overview of the field
of business and a basic understanding of how management, organizational structure, communication, and leadership
styles affect the business environment. It also introduces them to some of the power skills that help make successful
business professionals, including time management, problem solving, emotional intelligence and innovation; while also
teaching them the importance of ethics. This course gives students an opportunity to begin to explore their own strengths
and passions in relation to the field while also acclimating them to the online competency-based environment.
Global Arts and Humanities (D198A) - What makes us human? That is the question students will explore in this course
as they study the many facets of the arts and humanities, including literature, painting and sculpture, history, languages,
and philosophy. Students will also follow the creation and impact of music around the world. These aspects of our culture
are mirrors, reflecting who we are individually and collectively. By understanding the arts and humanities, students will
learn how people use these constructs to express themselves and communicate. In turn, they will discover the struggles
and triumphs we have all experienced. In addition, students will uncover what issues matter to us and how we are all
connected.
Introduction to Biology (C190A) - This course is a foundational introduction to the biological sciences. The overarching
theories of life from biological research are explored as well as the fundamental concepts and principles of the study of
living organisms and their interaction with the environment. Key concepts include how living organisms use and produce
energy; how life grows, develops, and reproduces; how life responds to the environment to maintain internal stability; and
how life evolves and adapts to the environment.
Introduction to Psychology (C180A) - In this course, students will develop an understanding of psychology and how it
helps them better understand others and themselves. Students will learn general theories about psychological
development, the structure of the brain, and how psychologists study behavior. They will gain an understanding of both
normal and disordered psychological behaviors, as well as general applications of the science of psychology in society
(such as personality typing and counseling).
Introduction to Sociology (C273A) - This course teaches students to think like sociologists, or, in other words, to see and
understand the hidden rules, or norms, by which people live, and how they free or restrain behavior. Students will learn
about socializing institutions, such as schools and families, as well as workplace organizations and governments.
Participants will also learn how people deviate from the rules by challenging norms and how such behavior may result in
social change, either on a large scale or within small groups.
Introduction to Statistics (MAT202) - Statistics is the study and application of data to solve problems. In this course,
learners will explore ways to represent and categorize data. They will learn about distributions of data, as well as the
relationships between different sets of data. They will learn how to use data to calculate probabilities and make
predictions. Then they will apply that knowledge to increase their understanding of statistics. Along the way, they will
learn that statistics is all around us—in sports, online shopping, medicine, business, technology, and artificial intelligence.
PACA: Introduction to Communications and Reflective Development (PACA101) - In this course, learners will explore
interacting with others and managing conflict. This knowledge will help them build positive relationships at home, work,
and school. Throughout the course, learners will be encouraged to improve their communication and relationship
management skills. They will learn strategies for working on self-awareness, empathy, emotion management, and
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 49
thriving mindset. Having these skills will increase their chances of success in academics and in their careers.
Precalculus (MAT201) - Numeracy is the ability to understand and use numbers. In this course, learners will improve
their numeracy and their ability to perform four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. With
these operations, learners will use not only whole numbers, but also integers, fractions, decimals, variables, and
algebraic expressions. They will learn to use data, functions, and graphs to analyze information. Once learners are
comfortable with the concepts, they will apply them to solve real-world problems they might face at work or at home.
Project Management (C722A) - Project Management prepares you to manage projects from start to finish within any
organization structure. The course represents a view into different project-management methods and delves into topics
such as project profiling and phases, constraints, building the project team, scheduling, and risk. You will be able to
grasp the full scope of projects you may work with on in the future, and apply proper management approaches to
complete a project. The course features practice in each of the project phases as you learn how to strategically apply
project-management tools and techniques to help organizations achieve their goals.
Scripting and Programming Foundations (D278A) - Scripting and Programming Foundations introduces programming
basics such as variables, data types, flow control, and design concepts. The course is language-agnostic in nature,
ending in a survey of languages, and introduces the distinction between interpreted and compiled languages. Learners
will gain skills in identifying scripts for computer program requirements and in using fundamental programming elements
as part of common computer programming tasks. Learners will also gain an understanding of the logic and outcome of
simple algorithms.
U.S. History (HIS101) - Studying history can be like traveling across time and space. This is true even when learners
study the history of their own country. In this course, learners will delve into the history of the United States from its
earliest beginnings to the late 20th century. They will realize that to appreciate history, they must be able to relate to the
people who lived in earlier times. They need to examine the decisions that historical figures made, what their daily lives
were like, and what relationships they had. They will also come to understand how history repeats itself.

Leavitt School of Health
Leavitt School of Health Tenets:
• Each student is unique. We align our systems and resources using Learner-Centered Faculty (LCF) tools to
support each personal journey toward graduation and success in their chosen healthcare career.
• Access matters. The lack of diversity in ethnicity and gender in the healthcare workforce contributes to the
continued disparities in health outcomes. We create access for diverse populations through onramps and visible
career pathways to change the composition of the healthcare workforce and improve health outcomes.
• Equity is an opportunity equalizer. We eliminate barriers and allocate resources to provide equity in access and
education for our learners, so they demonstrate equity in the care and services they provide as graduates. We
focus on improving fairness and eliminating bias in teaching and learning.
• Data matters. Our insights come from examining (and improving) processes at the program level and every level
of the college using the lens of our learner populations as our guide. Disparities in learner outcomes signal needed
changes in student support and data informs our ability to adjust in agile ways.
• Our learning products power the healthcare workforce. We continually evaluate the learning needs of the
healthcare industry and diversify our portfolio to include in-demand health professions degrees, microcredentials
and other learning products that position students for career success and provide needed talent to employers.
• Value and affordability are of equal importance. High quality, accredited health professions education requires
validation of competencies for patient and system engagement through supervised field experiences. We ensure
that learners are well prepared for the complexities of practice and carefully evaluate costs, so students have an
affordable, relevant education while ensuring quality and college sustainability.
• Partnerships accelerate our impact. We accelerate our reach and impact through mutually beneficial
partnerships. These relationships include donors, employers, educational institutions and healthcare industry
organizations and associations.

tangible evidence of our values and expectations around DEI, learning quality, and student care.
Steps to Become a Licensed Teacher
https://www.wgu.edu/online-teaching-degrees/becoming-licensed-teacher-accredited.html
WGU offers teacher certification programs including bachelor’s and master’s degree programs. Below is the standard
process for earning an initial teaching license through the WGU Teachers College.
1a. Earn a bachelor's degree
The online bachelor's teaching degree programs in the Teachers College at WGU include coursework and assessments,
a preclinical experience that includes observation hours and teaching lessons, and Student Teaching (explained in step
5).
1b. Complete a master’s degree (if you already have a bachelor’s degree)
If you already possess a bachelor’s degree in a non-teaching field, WGU’s Master of Arts in Teaching programs are the
choice for you. These teacher-prep programs qualify you to become licensed in the field of your choice (such as
elementary education, secondary mathematics, science, etc.), training you to become a highly qualified teacher. These
programs include supervised practice teaching (see step 5: Student Teaching) in an actual classroom setting.
2. Pass a background check
WGU requires all candidates for a teacher-certification program to provide the university with verification of a cleared
background check prior to entering the classroom for preclinical experiences and Student Teaching. Previously
completed background checks may not satisfy WGU background check requirements. In some states, more than one
background check may be required. In addition, most states require that applicants for teacher certification complete a
background check for the Department of Education prior to submitting all application paperwork. This is a necessary
precaution designed to prevent those who may pose a danger to the students in the classroom. You must be at least 18
years of age before you may begin the application process or participate in preclinical experiences and Student
Teaching.
3. Pass basic skills, content, and pedagogy exams
Each state has specific testing requirements that must be met or completed in addition to completing a teaching degree
program at WGU. WGU requires students to complete and pass:
• Basic Skills Exam: Pass the Basic Skills Exam required by your state for certification, or a designated Basic Skills
Exam if your state does not require one.
• Content Exam: You must pass the designated Content Exam(s) required by your state in order to graduate from
your program.
• WGU Program Exam: WGU also requires you to pass a specific Praxis exam to graduate from your program (with
© Western Governors University September 26, 2024 147
the exception of Elementary programs), often in addition to any certification exam required by your state.
• Pedagogy Exam: Finally, some states require the completion of a Pedagogy Exam, which assesses your
knowledge of teaching methods.
4. Complete preclinical experiences
In preparation for your formal Student Teaching (described in step 5 below), you will complete preclinical experiences
designed to introduce you to the classroom through a series of activities, including observations and lesson planning.
Working under the guidance of a WGU Placement Specialist, you will be asked to make arrangements with a local school
to complete these activities.
5. Complete a term of in-classroom Student Teaching
Student Teaching is a critical component of any teaching degree program. This in-classroom experience is invaluable in
helping to integrate the academic knowledge and teaching skills you’ve developed to this point into a practical application
that will prepare you to tackle the challenges of your own classroom effectively and with confidence.
Student Teaching at WGU covers the competencies required for in-classroom proficiency. Student Teaching is a full-
time, supervised, in-classroom experience of a minimum of 12–20 weeks. During Student Teaching, you will be hosted
by an experienced teacher. You will undergo a series of at least six observations by a Clinical Supervisor and also
receive evaluations from your Mentor Teacher to evaluate your performance based on accepted professional standards.
As you approach your Student Teaching, a WGU Placement Specialist will work with you to set up your placement. The
process of scheduling your placement may take up to six months. You may be required to assist in the process of setting
up your placement. In some cases, you may be required to commute up to two hours (or in rare cases longer than this).
Note that students are not permitted to work during their Student Teaching experience. You must be at least 18 years of
age before you may begin the application process or participate in preclinical experiences or Student Teaching.
Student Teaching may not be waived and prior experience may not be used to satisfy this requirement as you must
demonstrate competency in the classroom in order to complete your WGU degree program.
More information on field experiences can be found in the student handbook:
Initial Licensure Programs - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Field-Experiences-Handbook/tkb-p/fieldplacement
Advanced Programs - https://cm.wgu.edu/t5/Field-Experiences-Handbook/tkb-p/advancedprograms
6. Meet any additional state certification requirements
Some states have additional requirements for certification, such as coursework not included in your WGU program, CPR
certification, or workshops.
More information on your state's requirements - https://www.wgu.edu/online-teaching-degrees/state-licensure.html

Master of Arts in Teaching, Elementary Education
The Master of Arts in Teaching Elementary Education (MATELED) is a competency-based degree program that
prepares students with the competencies at the graduate level needed to apply for licensure as an elementary
educator. This program consists of online courses which take the learner from educational professional core
coursework, continuing through methods of elementary instruction and assessment, including inclusive practices for
students with mild to moderate exceptionalities. Candidates develop and refine their teaching skills through a series of
sequential experiences beginning with video-based observations and simulations of classroom instruction to prepare
candidates for authentic, collaborative, clinical teaching experiences in elementary settings. Clinical experiences
include teaching in face-to-face environments and culminate with supervised student teaching in a real classroom.
With the successful completion of degree requirements for graduation, including required assessments in the major
area of teaching, the student can receive institutional recommendation for licensure in elementary education.
