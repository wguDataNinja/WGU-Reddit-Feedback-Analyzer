Here‚Äôs the full, detailed but condensed logic for a complete program scrape, using your config.py and anchors.py correctly, and skipping the Courses section as a hard stop.

‚∏ª

üìÑ parse_steps_v10.md ‚Äî Full Program Scrape Logic (Pre-Program JSON Phase)

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 1. Setup
	‚Ä¢	Load TEST_FILE from config.TEST_FILE
	‚Ä¢	Load COLLEGE_SNAPSHOTS using pick_snapshot(catalog_date, COLLEGE_SNAPSHOTS)
	‚Ä¢	Strip whitespace from all lines for clean comparison

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 2. Identify First Entry Point
	‚Ä¢	Find the first match for ANCHORS["CCN_HEADER"]
	‚Ä¢	Walk upward from this point to find the first line in valid_colleges
‚Üí set as current_college

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 3. Walk Down to Discover Programs

While not at EOF:

a. Skip Until First Valid Program Title
	‚Ä¢	A valid program title is:
	‚Ä¢	Not matching FILTERS["PROGRAM_TITLE_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS"]
	‚Ä¢	Title-cased and not too short
	‚Ä¢	Not a known college name or generic label like ‚ÄúProgram Outcomes‚Äù

b. Start Degree Fence
	‚Ä¢	degree_name = line
	‚Ä¢	Save fence_start = current_line_index

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 4. Locate CCN Table and Parse Course Block

a. Walk forward to first ANCHORS["CCN_HEADER"]

‚Üí Marks start of course block

b. From here, collect lines until:
	‚Ä¢	First match for ANCHORS["FOOTER_TOTAL_CUS"]
	‚Ä¢	OR ANCHORS["FOOTER_COPYRIGHT"]
	‚Ä¢	OR next valid degree_name
	‚Ä¢	OR ANCHORS["SCHOOL_OF"] or a valid_college name
	‚Ä¢	OR ANCHORS["COURSES_SECTION_BREAK"]
‚Üí Marks end of course block + degree fence

c. Save:
	‚Ä¢	fence = [fence_start, fence_end]
	‚Ä¢	degree_name, current_college, course lines

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 5. Update State
	‚Ä¢	If a new college is found (line in valid_colleges), update current_college
	‚Ä¢	If ANCHORS["COURSES_SECTION_BREAK"] matches, terminate parsing
	‚Ä¢	Advance to next unvisited line and repeat

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 6. Output
	‚Ä¢	Save discovered degree names grouped by college
‚Üí Output to PROGRAM_NAMES_DIR / f"{catalog_date}_program_names_v10.json"
	‚Ä¢	Save fences per degree
‚Üí Output to SECTION_INDEX_PATH as sections_index_v10.json

‚∏ª

‚úÖ 7. Notes
	‚Ä¢	Course rows are parsed later using COURSE_PATTERNS (CCN_FULL, CODE_ONLY, FALLBACK)
	‚Ä¢	This logic avoids needing prebuilt program JSON and builds toward it

Let me know if you want this turned into runnable scaffolding or split into build steps.
