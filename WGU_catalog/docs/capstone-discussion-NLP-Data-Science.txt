1. 🧠 The Confusion Around “Data Science”
	•	Observation: There’s widespread confusion in the industry about what counts as “data science.”
	•	Problem: Many roles labeled “data science” involve little to no scientific method.
	•	Clarification:
	•	Data science should involve modeling, hypothesis testing, and iterative experimentation.
	•	Many so-called data science roles are actually analytics, engineering, or reporting.

2. 📐 On the Use of the Word Science
	•	In academia, “science” implies hypothesis-driven, experiment-based, generalizable inquiry.
	•	In industry, “data science” is often shorthand for working with data programmatically.
	•	This causes a disconnect: academic scientists wouldn’t call most industry “data science” roles science at all.
	•	The use of science should remain honest and contextually grounded.

3. 🧬 Where the Terms Intersect
	•	A useful anchor point: traditional scientists (e.g., biologists, physicists) use data science tools (like ML/NLP) within their scientific process.
	•	This helps clarify what real data science can look like: methods used in support of inquiry, not in place of it.

4. 🧪 What Makes Something “Science”?
	•	It starts with a question.
	•	Involves a hypothesis, experimentation, and interpretation.
	•	Tools like NLP or machine learning don’t make something scientific by themselves — the process and intent do.

7. 🔄 Scientific Method vs. Data Analytics

Alignment:

Scientific Method	Data Analytics
Ask a research question	Define a business/analysis question
Form a hypothesis	Form an assumption or hunch
Design an experiment	Collect relevant data
Collect data	Wrangle and clean data
Analyze data	Perform exploratory and statistical analysis
Draw conclusions	Generate insights and recommendations
Test / refine hypothesis	Iterate or optimize based on findings

Insight:

Data analytics overlaps deeply with the scientific method.
Analytics seeks insight. Science seeks truth.

🎓 Philosophy & Framing
	•	There is widespread confusion about the term “data science”. Many industry roles are analytics/reporting rebranded as data science.
	•	True data science requires hypothesis-driven, experimental, and generalizable inquiry — not just working with data.
	•	The use of the word “science” should remain honest and contextually grounded.
	•	The overlap between scientific method and analytics is real:
	•	Analytics = insight
	•	Science = truth

🧪 Scientific Method vs Analytics Table

Scientific Method	Data Analytics
Ask a question	Define a business problem
Form a hypothesis	Form an assumption or hunch
Design an experiment	Gather relevant data
Collect & analyze data	Clean + analyze data
Interpret results	Generate insights
Test/refine	Optimize recommendations
