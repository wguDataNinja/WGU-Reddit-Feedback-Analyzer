üõ†Ô∏è DEV LOG ‚Äî WGU Catalog Scraper (Section 1 Test)

Objective:
- Test initial logic that locates and fences the first academic program section in a catalog file.

What We Did:
- Ran fence-building script on the first catalog (`catalog_2017_01.txt`)
- Loaded program names for the catalog date
- Identified the **first college** from snapshot: `College of Health Professions`
- Located the **first degree** listed under that college: `Bachelor of Science, Nursing (RN to BSN)`
- Scanned forward to find the associated `CCN_HEADER`
- Calculated a **fence range**: `start_idx` to `stop_idx` for that degree's course block

Cutoff:
‚úÖ **Script halted immediately after successfully fencing the first degree**
üõë This is the precise point where the script normally continues looping through all degrees ‚Äî 
we stopped here to validate section parsing logic before scaling up.

## ‚úÖ Goal  
Connect ChatGPT to VSCode and enable a fluid workflow between code editing and AI assistance ‚Äî without constant app switching or manual copy/paste.

---

## üß† Key Learnings & Outcomes

### üîπ VSCode Features & Shortcuts
- Discovered **`Cmd + Shift + P`** ‚Üí **Command Palette**
  - Power feature: run anything (interpreter switch, extension command, kernel select, etc.)
- Learned **`Cmd + \``** opens the VSCode terminal
- Understood the role of the **left sidebar (Activity Bar)** and how to toggle panels

### üîπ ChatGPT Desktop Integration (Reality Check)
- Installed and tested the **official ChatGPT VSCode extension (by OpenAI)**
- Learned it **does not open a sidebar in VSCode**
- Instead, it **opens the ChatGPT desktop app**, passing code selections into a new or paired conversation
- Confirmed that even with pairing, **ChatGPT can only edit files ‚Äî not execute code or show output**
- Used the "Option + Space" shortcut to open ChatGPT pairing popup inside VSCode

### üîπ Verified Integration Path
- Opened `scrape_catalog.py` in VSCode
- Used ChatGPT to inject a debug line:
  ```python
  import os
  print("[DEBUG] Current working directory:", os.getcwd())


  Sure ‚Äî here‚Äôs a concise dev log summarizing your progress so far, structured like a proper internal note.

üìì Dev Log ‚Äì WGU Catalog Scraper (Notebook Refactor)

Date: 2025-07-13
Author: Buddy
Goal: Refactor the catalog scraper logic into a notebook environment using existing tools from lib/config.py and lib/anchors.py

‚∏ª

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Working

üì¶ Config + Imports
	‚Ä¢	config.py provides all shared paths, input files, and constants
	‚Ä¢	anchors.py includes all structural regex patterns (CCN_HEADER, COURSE_CODE, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	sys.path.insert(...) used to access lib/ from inside /notebooks
	‚Ä¢	Config constants like TEXT_DIR, COLLEGE_SNAPSHOTS, and COURSE_PATTERNS are usable

üõ† Helper Functions

Defined directly in the notebook (clean workaround to import/exec errors from config.py):
	‚Ä¢	extract_catalog_date(file_name)
	‚Ä¢	pick_snapshot(catalog_date, snapshot_dict)

These enable date-based lookups of trusted college sections.

üìÑ Catalog Parsing
	‚Ä¢	Read .txt catalog file from TEXT_DIR
	‚Ä¢	Extracted catalog_date from file name
	‚Ä¢	Pulled list of valid colleges using college_snapshots.json via pick_snapshot()
	‚Ä¢	Located the first college block using valid_colleges[0]
	‚Ä¢	Found first CCN_HEADER after that block
	‚Ä¢	Collected candidate course rows below it
	‚Ä¢	Matched course rows using COURSE_PATTERNS

‚∏ª

üß© Code Structure

Notebook has clear, modular sections:
	1.	Import project + define helpers
	2.	Load + preprocess catalog file
	3.	Locate first real program block (by college)
	4.	Detect first CCN block and extract sample rows
	5.	Match rows using regex patterns

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Encountered
	‚Ä¢	extract_catalog_date was not visible via from lib import config due to runtime crash in config.py (file I/O before function defs)
	‚Ä¢	VS Code flagged false ModuleNotFoundError: 'lib' due to static analysis (harmless, ignored)
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter notebook‚Äôs dynamic pathing caused temporary import confusion (resolved via sys.path.insert)

‚∏ª

üìå Next Steps
	‚Ä¢	Generalize fence detection across all colleges in a file
	‚Ä¢	Export matched rows into CSV
	‚Ä¢	Optionally write sections_index_v10.json (if doing verified output)
	‚Ä¢	Add anomaly logging for non-matching rows
	‚Ä¢	Wrap parsing into a reusable parse_catalog(file_path) function
