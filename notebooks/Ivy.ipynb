    "**Purpose**  \n",
    "This notebook runs the complete Ivy pipeline, from raw Reddit posts to final JSON outputs, in five steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preprocessing: Query raw Reddit posts from the SQLite database, extract course codes, score sentiment, and filter for strong negative signals  \n",
    "2. Taxonomy pass  \n",
    "3. Cluster detection  \n",
    "4. Root cause labeling  \n",
    "5. Peer advice and help-seeking pattern extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is structured JSON files for each course, ready for staff review and dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `/sqlite/wgu_reddit.db`  \n",
    "**Intermediate:** `/outputs/preprocessed/{CourseCode}_clean_posts.csv`  \n",

If you did well on sections you DID read, read them again.\\n\\n\\-Information Security should not be something you struggle with here, if you are this far, you have your Security+, and all of the security terms are repetition from that certification.\\n\\n\\-Three objectives make up 16%, 21%, and 29% of the exam respectively, focus on those the most.\\n\\n\\-Take all quizzes through the course material, after you read more, take the PA again (THIS TIME look at the answers you missed.)\\n\\n\\-After this, read more and more on what you are not comfortable with, then take the OA.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf it means anything I took it at 11PM for the best proctoring experience, since proctoring is horrible in the middle of the day.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere are no useful external sources for this class, please stop rushing, you need to take your time with this class at the very least. \\n\\n*(Don't waste your time on quizlets, email your instructor for any resources they have the moment you click start course!)*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOverall, yes this class is very dense, but this information is EXTREMELY USEFUL for management, which is why you have this class to begin with. I started my job the same day I started this class, and saw so many things from this class brought up in the real IT environment.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDo not be afraid of your courses, embrace this experience even if you're an accelerator.

Not a lot of this class was new info to me, just reminders and practice. \\n\\nHere's what I did:\\n\\nSep 16, Monday  \\n0800-1000 : strategizing (via reddit), course planning tool, intro video (5 mins), zybook ch 1.  \\n1030-1230 : zybook 2.1 - 2.14, call with PM.  \\n1400-1600 : zybook 2.15 - 3.2 (didn't read everything, but did all the activities).\\n\\nSep 17, Tuesday  \\n0800-1000 : zybook 3.3 - 3.16.1  \\n1030-1230 : zybook 3.16.2 - 3.27  \\n1400-1600 : zybook 4.1 - 4.11\\n\\nSep 18, Wednesday  \\nNo school - I got my driver's license! If I start slacking on school this will be the reason, lol.\\n\\nSep 19, Thursday  \\n0800-1000 : zybook 4.14 - 5.4  \\n1030-1230 : zybook 5.5 - 5.16  \\n1400-1600 : zybook 5.17 - 6.5\\n\\nSep 20, Friday  \\n0800-1000 : zybook practice test  \\n1030-1230 : PA - perfect, scheduled OA\\n\\nSep 21, Saturday  \\n0800-1030 : review labs 6 and 9, OA.\\n\\nNotes: I got one question wrong. The one with Random. The pa uses integers, but the oa wants you to generate random doubles within a range. I recommend being able to do that, as I spent 30 minutes trying to logic my way around it with no success before finally giving up. The OA is very, very similar to the PA. At least it was for me.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x795mc7ou6qd1.png?width=1009&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a09240a7162d3c1892d315c1e666ba4c6fb76f8c</td>\n",

       "      <td>Completed MSCSIA (Masters in Cybersecurity) in 40 days - it was challenging, not for everyone, many more would drop out, most would graduate in 1 year\\nI know, many hate to see such posts, but give me a chance. I'm in my mid-40s, have good IT background going back to high school (including programming in C, if anyone remembers that), have several small kids, work full time, and already have a Ph.D., as well as an undergrad from top universities (nationally and globally). \\n\\nSo going into this, I had many questions: WGU is radically different from anything I am used to - not making me comfortable.\\n\\nKnowing that CI's don't have any power and everything is evaluated anonymously, raised a lot of suspicions on my end.  \\n\\nReading horror stories about Examity didn't exactly inspire me. \\n\\nThe external camera requirement seemed like they were really going overboard. \\n\\n\"Will I have the time?\" That was a huge question, along with \"Do I really need this?\" These two questions underpinned everything for me. Basically, unless I could do this accredited and ranked degree in one semester, especially since I was paying for it myself, it was not worth it for me. \\n\\nHowever, I decided to take the plunge and transferred 3 classes due to already having CISM and CASP and other cyber certifications. I could have transferred 5 classes, but I decided to take CySA and Pentest while at WGU: it's cheaper that way plus I learn more. So I had to complete 7 remaining classes. I thought to myself: as long as I spend about 2 weeks per class, I should be able to do it in less that one semester/term. I need to complete everything before March ideally, since I have some major training for a different great program starting then.\\n\\nSo I start on Dec 1, but immediately get knocked down by an RSV from my youngest kid. As a result, the first 3 days are wasted laying in bed and being unable to concentrate. Very sad mood. So that took a lot of steam from under me, and now I got worried - Winter just started, and I was already down. \\n\\nPlus, now kids had a major change in schedule their coaches insisted on - they would now require more training time with their sports since they would be competing - which means I would be a part-time taxi service for them. So I had to read a lot of the WGU materials in the app, while sitting in the car with the heater on and off. As a note, I read all WGU materials, watched all videos, did half of all the labs, and read some of the books or chapters they assigned as optional reading. So I did not do what other accelerators do, which is go straight to the OA/PA. My goal was also to learn or refresh my skills somewhat, but certainly without exerting myself and without learning something completely from scratch (which is why I would not do a Masters in Computer Science, as I just don't want to learn some programming language - I know and understand enough of that, and won't be a programmer ever).\\n\\nOK, now started the first class, and followed the directions in one of the labs which said it required a paper, with screenshots. I did it, and proudly submitted to CI, only to find out that actually that lab in that class was not required at all - it was optional. So I wasted one (1) precious day of reading, following instructions, and writing a paper that was unnecessary. One day for me is significant - I'm a working adult. In one day I typically accomplish a lot. \"What a 'great' start!\" I am thinking to myself. \"Did you really need THIS? You don't have enough things in your life, you needed a 'challenge'?\"\\n\\nFinally, I got that class out of the way, and now felt better: I did it in less than the 2 weeks I allotted to myself per class. Now let's start the second and third classes - which require CySA exam and the Pentest exam. CySA was not hard for me since I already had more advanced CASP+, but Pentest+ was quite hard. I was really challenged, I thought it would be in the same league as Security+, but in reality, it's almost at the level of CASP+, and harder than CySA+. Thankfully, I prepared and refreshed my memory for a few days, and was familiar with Comptia exams. Otherwise, I don't know if I could have passed it on the first try. But getting vouchers, and then scheduling these exams takes time (I had to wait for 5 days for my CySA exam between scheduling it and actually taking it, for example, as Comptia was very busy in mid-December, before the holidays). After passing my exams I had to wait another 3 business days for exam results to be posted and classes to officially be completed. Without that, my mentor, who was not very experienced, was scared to allow me to register for more classes. The 2-days of weekends always had a negative effect as well, since it seemed like I submitted my papers or passed my Comptia exams on Friday's, thus having to wait longer (WGU allows 3 business days for grading, so in effect that could be 5 days with weekends).\\n\\nAnyhow, now I was done with 3 classes, and felt much better, but while waiting for these exam results, I started my 4th class, after convincing my mentor to allow me to take it - and submitted the paper that required me to use their incident response template. The \"originality report\" did not show the results of the check for over 24 hours, and I just went ahead and submitted it without it. The evaluator kicked it back, accusing me of plagiarism, since the checker ended up showing that the paper was 50% \"similar.\" I was still not familiar with all WGU processes, and it took me a while to understand how to navigate and read their evaluation reports, as well as \"similarity\" reports. I understood that the evaluator was totally inexperienced and forgot to exclude the text of the template from the checker - thus of course my paper was \"similar\". Then the names of the people, the names of the machine, the IP addresses -- all of this unavoidable and required information was also \"similar\" and evaluator forgot to exclude. \\n\\nSo now I have a crisis on my hands - I have a black mark on me and thanks to the incompetence of the anonymous evaluator I'm in deep trouble. I start remembering my initial hesitation with WGU precisely because of these anonymous evaluators and tell myself, \"See, you were right to think and predict this, but you didn't listen to yourself! Now go and waste your time dealing with this lemon!\" And dealing I did: I wrote protest emails to two officials at WGU, with a detailed analysis of what happened and what their evaluator did wrong. I called their assessment team and could barely contain my anger, explaining what happened. The lady on the line was very sympathetic to what happened, and felt like she understood the problem, but could only refer it to the anonymous evaluators, whose names and phones she doesn't have. I was very angry, and mentor was not helpful. But the next day an assistant dean wrote to me, said they investigated, agreed with me, accepted the paper, and removed the black mark from my name, clearing the record (yes, once you are accused of plagiarism they keep tabs on you). \\n\\nWhile I won, this wasted at least another working day from me, and caused a lot of stress I didn't need or deserve. As I mentioned earlier, I am very sensitive to even one wasted day. But now I completed 4 classes, and had just 3 more remaining, including Capstone. I'm thinking to myself - OK, I'm doing well, it looks like I can complete the degree in 30 days total.\\n\\nSo I started D485 -- and hit a brick wall. While I was trying to understand the requirements of this class' assignment, I asked to do D487, which I completed in a few days. But now all I had between me and the Capstone was D485. Calling IT help desk, or the student services, or mentor, or even CI, didn't help. Everything I found online was somewhat helpful, but not a lot, and nothing could bypass the need to learn Azure. Which I really didn't want to, since we use AWS, things change too quickly (case in point: Azure renamed Active Directory to Entra ID just a few months ago, while lab still shows AD), and I'm in the management. I paid my dues sort of speak, and don't need to be a sysadmin or cloudadmin Level II. I understand it enough, I really don't need to create RGs in Azure. But to pass this class it was essential, and I forced myself to watch everything there was. Since having work, kids, sports, etc., it took me 4 days to watch Pluralsight and read Azure's own training, and since the lab doesn't save the results and is slow, I had to go in, and redo settings 5-6 times.   \\n\\n\\nAbout CI's: the CI tried to be helpful, with tips and cohort recordings (and same is true of all other classes, where CI's try to be helpful, but are really limited on what they can do. Indeed, they are probably as helpful as any professor in any online program in most universities). So I really liked the CIs, but they are severely limited. That's something WGU must change in the future if it really wants to become a Top 50 university.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well. But I was able to start Capstone basically after NY, it took them 1 day to approve Task 1, then I submitted Task 2, and it was kicked back, since I didn't understand - as it's not really in the requirements - that I have to write as if my company has been hacked, i.e., there was some kind of a cyberincident. That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well. But I was able to start Capstone basically after NY, it took them 1 day to approve Task 1, then I submitted Task 2, and it was kicked back, since I didn't understand - as it's not really in the requirements - that I have to write as if my company has been hacked, i.e., there was some kind of a cyberincident. That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day. It took mentor 2 days to submit paperwork for graduation.  \\n\\n\\nSo the end result: I am glad I took the plunge, and did this quickly and on budget. It was definitely not easy, had I been 20-something, it would have taken me the full 6 months, even though I was sharper, faster, and had boundless energy back then. I'm slower, and can't concentrate anymore, but I'm also smarter, more focused, methodical, and disciplined (not much social life helps). It was definitely worth it for me because of this, and thank you to WGU for creating and maintaining a regionally accredited degree that's ranked high and keeps improving, with strict anti-plagiarism measures and external cameras to nip critics in the bud and maintain the value of the degree. I say this despite being a victim of the unprofessionalism of one particular overzealous evaluator, or having many other things I could criticize. This program is on par with programs at most other universities (except the most select).   \\n\\n\\nThus, I did it in 40 days, would have done it in 30 days, and if I knew WGU processes and was luckier, then maybe even in 20 days. **But** I also know that less than 1% can complete a degree quickly, and for every such accelerator there are 10 who drop out, and 90% who finish on regular schedule. It was a challenging program - Capstone was not easy but super fun nevertheless (that's the geek in me), D485 I will remember forever (I hated it, but hugely respect it and will always tell this story to my kids), and other classes that required you to draw network diagrams or do Examity proctored exams, made it very challenging, since had to learn new skills or refresh long-forgotten Visio skills, and had very little direction and explanation from WGU. Yet there was no need for busywork, no unnecessary stretching of the program or overloading the student with 10 books per class. So it's perfect for a working professional, who doesn't have the time of the 20-something full-time student (or even part-time student -- you guys, if you think you are \"busy\", wait until you marry, have kids, senior position at work, and other social obligations).   \\n\\n\\nI would love for WGU to make a few improvements, so I could take another degree or two from it:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1) give CI's more power, and make them assistant professors at least. Let them publish research. This will improve rankings. And allow students to pair up with professors to publish research jointly, based on the capstone project.\\n\\n2) anonymous evaluators are not cool. I get the perceived need for that, but WGU should not be CIA.\\n\\n3) update the curriculum! (The OSI model is ridiculous, for example, and has always been controversial. It is unnecessary when there is a TCP/IP model which is actually used. Where is anything on blockchains? Crypto? Adversarial AI/ML? Post-quantum cryptography? SD-WANs?) Yes, it's not bad compared to other universities, but compare yourselves to Georgia Tech, MIT, Johns Hopkins, etc. This will improve the ranking further.\\n\\n4) require papers for every class. Even if these classes have Comptia exams.\\n\\n5) clarify all requirements and put them all in one document. Please don't say \"they already are.\" No, they are not. We can test it - WGU officials in charge should write a paper, and submit to me, and see what will happen.\\n\\n6) Mentors have too much power at the expense of the students. A lot of WGU students are working adults. We should not need to ask permission to register for classes. I should be able to start 4 classes at once if I want. It's my risk, my transcript, my life. And I paid for it already. \\n\\n7) Gain more and better accreditations for IT, Business, and other colleges and programs. \\n\\n8) Allow students to enroll in two programs at once - for example, IT and nursing. Not dual degree, but keep them as two separate programs, two separate degrees. Just allow them to be taken concurrently, not \"finish and graduate from one, and only then start the second one\". Again, we are adults, we know what we want and what we can. Every month and every day matters for us. If I finish/graduate on September 6, it means I can only start my studies in a new program at WGU on November 1. But if I would have been able to graduate by September 5, I could start on October 1. Just one day, and such a huge effect. \\n\\n9) Improve the orientation class. Right now it's very long and cumbersome. Make it shorter, and have a clear \"quick start\" guide that has everything we need on it. Right now everything is clunky, orientation is a waste of time, and for some reason it pollutes our transcripts, by being listed on it as a zero-credit class. Totally unnecessary to include zero credit, non-academic \"course\" which is not a course on it. \\n\\nSo recruiters and HR reading this: this is a very legit degree, that's more challenging than most others, yet can be had in a matter of weeks, not a year like others. Graduates of this program actually learn smth, and can do things, unlike most graduates of other programs who learn theory and would quickly forget or get confused within weeks of graduation. \\n\\nThank you all, this forum and its members have been great.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

       "      <td>Finished BSIT in 6 months - here are my tips for accelerating\\nFirst thing: accelerating isn't for everyone! I know that posts about accelerating are frustrating to some people on this sub. This post is not to suggest that my process is the best or the only way to approach this degree. The benefit of WGU is that it's useful to people in a number of different situations. If you're not accelerating, this post may not be helpful for you. You'll notice that my focus is on passing the final assessment in the most efficient way, not necessarily on learning as much as possible.\\n\\nFor a bit more context about myself, this is actually my 2nd BS degree which meant I only had to take the IT-specific courses. I don't think I could have possibly done the degree in 6 months if I also had to take the general ed courses. I also have a decent amount of experience in this field; I've been a high school computer science teacher for 7 years and have taught IT, Linux, Python, Web Dev, Cybersecurity, and AWS courses for a number of years.\\n\\nThis is also my second WGU degree. I accelerated a WGU Masters in Instructional Design in one term a few years back, then I got my Doctorate in education, then I started this IT degree in September 2023. Having an IT degree makes me eligible for a yearly stipend as a teacher which is why I wanted to get this degree.\\n\\nI tracked everything in a spreadsheet as I progressed through the program, including the total hours I spent on each class and resources that I found most helpful. I found a lot of good tips here on Reddit and I wanted to pay it forward by sharing my own experience as well.\\n\\n**General advice:**\\n\\n* Use Chat-GPT to study! Anytime you see a term that you don't understand, ask Chat-GPT to explain it to you. This is absolutely the best way to quickly wrap your mind around some of these concepts. I always had a Chat-GPT window up while I was studying.\\n* For all WGU classes (the non-certification courses) you should take the pre-assessment (PA) before doing anything else. Then check your coaching report and study any areas that are marked with the yellow \"Approaching Competence\" score. Once you understand why you got those pre-assessment questions wrong, take the objective assessment (OA). You get two free attempts, so it's worth it to take the first attempt quickly. If you fail, your instructor will email you with a few specific things to study, and once you do that you'll be more than ready for the second attempt.\\n* For all the certification classes (ITIL, A+, Linux, AWS, PM+, Net+, Sec+) I found three things to be the most helpful: the Professor Messer YouTube playlist for that exam, the Jason Dion 6 Practice Exam Udemy course, and the Sybex book and online practice questions. **Don't use CertMaster.** The questions suck and are nothing like the actual exam questions.\\n* Jason Dion has 6 practice exams for each certification. Take each one of them, but be sure to review the explanations for each question you get wrong before taking the next exam. Use Chat-GPT to explain things you don't understand. If you have to pay for the Udemy course remember that you can get a full refund within 30 days.\\n\\n**Intro to IT - D322:**\\n\\n* This class took me two hours. I passed my PA on the first try and immediately scheduled the OA. This class is a good measure of how quickly you could accelerate this degree - if this class is easy for you, you likely already have the fundamental IT knowledge required to accelerate more classes.\\n\\n**Business of IT - Applications - D336 (ITIL certification):**\\n\\n* This class took three hours.  I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/t9khiz/business_of_it_applications_c846passed/) to be very helpful. I would describe the ITIL certification as a corporate lingo cert. Focus on understanding the ITIL-specific context of each term and concept and you'll be fine. These terms are also used in the PM+, Net+, and Sec+ exams you'll take in the future so this is a great time to get familiar with them.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Foundations - D315:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour. [This study guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgo-OBPx24RTJ46Qay2WUzg8P3CGRmO0/view) is perfect and has everything you need to know. Spend as much time as you need on this study guide, as all the material you study here overlaps heavily with the A+, Net+, and Sec+ exams you'll take later. MEMORIZE THE OSI LAYERS NOW. You'll need to memorize them anyway, so you might as well do it now.\\n\\n**IT Applications - D317 (A+ core 2 certification):**\\n\\n* This class took me 15 hours. I watched [this Messer Core 2 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MHDU4kFChU&amp;list=PLG49S3nxzAnna96gzhJrzkii4hH_mgW4b) on 1.75 speed and used [Dion's Udemy Core 2 exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-220-1102-core-2-practice-exams-new-for-2022/) to practice. I didn't use the [Sybex book](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Complete-Deluxe-Study-Guide/dp/1119515963) for this class, but if you need extra study material I highly recommend their stuff.\\n\\n**Organizational Behavior and Leadership - C484:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour and was by far the easiest class in the whole program. I don't have any background in Organizational Behavior but everything here was easy common sense stuff. If you're a good test taker you could pass this exam without any studying.\\n\\n**Spreadsheets - C268:**\\n\\n* This class took 2 hours. The OA is identical to the PA; they just changed the numbers in the spreadsheet. If you know how to do everything for the PA spreadsheet you'll be fine on the OA.\\n\\n**Scripting and Programming - Foundations - D278:**\\n\\n* This took me 1 hour. I've taught programming for years so I didn't have to study for this one. The Zybooks material provided by WGU is a great way to learn this for beginners.\\n\\n**Web Development Foundations - D276:**\\n\\n* This class also took me 1 hour. I've taught Web Development for years so I didn't need to study for this one either. The Zybooks material is great for this class as well.\\n\\n**IT Foundations - D316 (A+ core 1 certification):**\\n\\n* This class took 22 hours. Once again, I watched the [Messer Core 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87t6P5ZHTP0&amp;list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) playlist on 1.75 speed and used [Dion's Udemy Core 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-220-1101-core-1-practice-exams-new-for-2022/) exams to practice. I didn't use the [Sybex book](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Complete-Deluxe-Study-Guide/dp/1119515963) here, but it's great if you need additional study material.\\n\\n**Web Development Applications - C777:**\\n\\n* This class took 3 hours. I don't have any specific tips here, just take the PA, study your weak areas, and take the OA.\\n\\n**Linux Foundations - D281:**\\n\\n* This class took me 10 hours. This is the only exam I failed on my first try. The most useful study guide is the official [one published by LPI](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/010-160/) \\- spin up a Linux VM and run all the commands in the study guide. [Shawn Powers'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skTShEHyXfo&amp;list=PL78ppT-_wOmvlYSfyiLvkrsZTdQJ7A24L) YouTube playlist was decent. After I failed my first attempt I attended a review session with the instructor which was very helpful.\\n\\n**User Interface Design - C773:**\\n\\n* This class took 5 hours. Make sure to use the links in the \"Course Tips\" section where you can see examples and other resources. Be sure to follow the rubric exactly. Don't try to get too fancy with anything. Just do exactly what the rubric is asking for. Remember that the evaluators probably don't have much IT knowledge; they're just looking to see if the rubric item is present in your submission.\\n\\n**Information Systems Management - C724:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour. It's another straightforward class where you should immediately take the PA, study your weak areas, then take the OA.\\n\\n**Cloud Foundations - D282 (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner):**\\n\\n* I earned this cert several years ago so I didn't have to take this class. I don't have any tips for accelerating.\\n\\n**Business of IT - Project Management - D324 (Project+ certification):**\\n\\n* This class took 20 hours, and was probably my least favorite class. I couldn't find a good YouTube playlist for this class, so the majority of my study time was spent on the [Sybex Project+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Project-Study-Guide-PK0-005-ebook/dp/B0BCZTHL6R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=29FKNHHW6LMZ4&amp;keywords=sybex+project%2B&amp;qid=1707755705&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=sybex+project%2B%2Cstripbooks%2C143&amp;sr=1-1), their online question bank, and the [Dion practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-project-pk0-005-practice-exams-a/).\\n\\n**Data Management - Foundations - D426:**\\n\\n* This class took me 7 hours. I didn't have any prior experience with SQL so all the content here was very new to me. I did 100% of the Zybooks material and also used the [DataCamp.com](https://app.datacamp.com/search?q=sql&amp;technology=SQL) SQL courses. You can sign into [DataCamp.com](https://DataCamp.com) with your WGU email and get everything there for free.\\n\\n**Data Management - Applications - D427:**\\n\\n* This class took 5 hours. I did all the Zybooks material and more of the [DataCamp.com](https://DataCamp.com) exercises.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies - C850:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour. My first submission didn't pass, but I just used the feedback from the first submission to make a few quick changes and my second submission passed. Use the WGU curriculum to make sure you're doing the Gartner STREET process correctly.\\n\\n**Networks - D325 (Network+ certification):**\\n\\n* This class took 30 hours, but I actually enjoyed studying for this class. Networking is really cool when you start understanding how it all works. I watched [Messer's Network+ playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As6g6IXcVa4&amp;list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G) on 1.75 speed, used the [Sybex Network+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Study-Guide-Authorized/dp/1119811635/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1JKBP8OEE9TH0&amp;keywords=sybex+network%2B&amp;qid=1707756879&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=sybex+network%2B%2Cstripbooks%2C158&amp;sr=1-3), their online question bank, and [Dion's 6 Network+ practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-008-exams/). I was scoring in the 70% range on the Dion exams and passed the real exam on my first try.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications - D329 (Security+ certification):**\\n\\n* This one took 25 hours. I watched [Messer's Security+ playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&amp;list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8) on 1.75 speed, used the [Sybex Security+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Study-Guide-SY0-601/dp/1119736250/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3A8HIFHEDTDYN&amp;keywords=sybex+security%2B&amp;qid=1707757100&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=sybex+security%2B%2Cstripbooks%2C101&amp;sr=1-4), their online question bank, and [Dion's 6 Security+ practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/security-601-exams/). I was scoring in the 70% range on the Dion exams and passed the real exam on my first try.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project - C769:**\\n\\n* This only took about an hour because I used a project I had already done, so all I really needed to do was the write-ups for it. Just use the templates provided by WGU and make sure you meet each rubric requirement.</td>\n",

It's an excellent introduction to CS and if you're a beginner like me, you'll benefit from at least reading through chapter 9 or 10 before starting this class. Also watch this series to understand memory better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bum_19loj9A&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H\\n\\nThis course assumes you know enough about programming to follow code samples in C to learn aspects of assembly language (LEGv8). The OA also includes questions on finding the equivalent C code to some LEGv8 code snippets. I don't think you need to be an expert but spend some time to gain familiarity in the code if you aren't coming in with a background in either programming or C (the c949 book mentioned above offers a lot of practice in following code in general which is really useful). This is the lecture series I used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NWeucMKrLI&amp;list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq  \\n\\nHere is a crash course in Assembly Language which is good for getting a big-picture view of chapter 3.  \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75gBFiFtAb8  \\n\\nChapter 2 is deceivingly simple. Chapters 3 and 4 are VERY intimidating; beware of rabbit hole syndrome! I struggled more than I should have because I didn't know how much I needed to know C until I had already invested a lot of time pushing through chapters 3 and 4. I think even with a short background in C the chapters are grueling and freakishly long. But you'll read it with more confidence and direction if you first take the time to be familiar with C beforehand. \\n\\nHopefully the course will come out with a study guide along with some C and ARMv8 cohorts at some point. \\n\\nMake sure you study memory, cache, armv8 code, pipelining, and parallel processing. Have a good idea of what arithmetic operations to use: when and how they work, what causes a data hazard, and how loads and stores work, etc. \\n\\nEDIT: More sources posted by another student, so good that I wanted to link it here - https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/d2rl7j/computer_architecture_c952_passed_w_additional/\\n\\nEDIT: I wanted to add a book suggestion. It's not class related which is why I'm putting it at the bottom ... If you want to understand and be able to integrate the material in this course, give Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris a read. WGU presents its topics as somewhat disjoint concepts and this book integrates them in a way that Zybooks fails to. However, don't read it until after you've completed Discrete Math I (you'll need to know your boolean algebra and have a basic understanding of proofs to get through it). For what it's worth. \\n\\nP.S. Join slack if you need more help or want to connect with other BSCS students - https://join.slack.com/t/wgu-itpros/signup</td>\n",

My term ends in two days and I started studying less than a week ago, however I've studied probably 30 hours since then. The bulk of it was forcing myself to read through the Zybook.

Just search the course number when you start the course.\\n\\nI completed the BS in Business Administration, Accounting in October 2023. I transferred in an Associates in Business, and I had 65 credit units to complete (22 classes total). I completed them all in one 6 month term. I was working super full time as a Practice Manager, including a daily commute. I also have a husband and two kids (teenagers). It was NOT easy. I got up at 5am a lot and worked basically every night and every weekend on school. I did take a couple of weeks off during the term.  I am self-pay, so I was super motivated not to pay for another term.\\n\\nThe photo of the course dates makes it look like I completed several courses later in the program in a day or so, but I was working on 2-3 courses at a time, so the end dates for some just ended up being really close together.  (If you show your mentor that you are accelerating, they shouldn't have a problem adding two courses at a time to your term after the initial four.) The first week of courses were fast. I had access to some of the course material a couple weeks before my term started. (I was clicking around on the WGU app in the courses and found that some allowed me to view the material before the term.)\\n\\nI took several months off school after graduating, quit my job (changing careers), and started a tax preparer internship in February. I started the MS Accounting program March 1, 2024. After tax season, I basically didn't have anything to do except school. I could have gotten this done a lot sooner than the 6 months, but I heard that it doesn't get you your transcripts any faster (which is what I need for the CPA cert).

       "      <td>One week, passed D315 â€“ Network and Security Foundations (ft. my study bunny)\\nHello everyone, I finished my second WGU class today. D315 â€“ Network and Security Foundations. I'm posting because I like reading/replying to comments, gives me a bit of accountability, and maybe someone will find useful information here.\\n\\nA bit about my situation: 17 years old, started WGU for the BS in CompSci on Aug 1. I definitely (intentionally) over-studied for this class, I went through *all* the course materials (there were some pretty long chapters to read), watched all 4 cohorts, and watched the recorded lessons (v2). Because I am a full-time student (no job at the moment) and donâ€™t mind the study process, I was able to go through all the material and pass the class within a week. Clearly, depending on how much you already know, how much time you spend studying, and how easily you can memorize terms/definitions/standards, it will take you more/less time.\\n\\nHow long it took - 31 hrs total (according to my study bunny, second photo).\\n\\nBreakdown:\\n\\n**Fri, Aug 2 -**\\n\\n2.5 hours of studying - started the class. (I finished my previous class this day).\\n\\n**Sat, Aug 3 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (section 1, 1.5 â€“ 1.7), + first 20 minutes of cohort 1.\\n\\n1030-1230 Course materials (section 1, 1.7 â€“ 3.2).\\n\\n1400-1600 course materials (section 1, 3.3 - 4.1), + second 20 minutes of cohort 1.\\n\\n**Sun, Aug 4 â€“ Rest day.**\\n\\n**Mon, Aug 5 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (finished section 1).\\n\\n0930-1130 Course materials (section 2, 1 - 1.2).\\n\\n1300-1500 Course materials (section 2, 1.3 - 1.4), + first half of cohort 2.\\n\\n**Tue, Aug 6 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (finished section 2), + second half of cohort 2, course materials (section 3, 1-1.5)\\n\\n0930-1130 Course materials (section 3, 1.6 - 2.7).\\n\\n1300-1500 Course materials (section 3, 2.8-3.2)\\n\\n**Wed, Aug 7 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (section 3, 3.3).\\n\\n0930-1030 Course materials (section 3, half of 3.4).\\n\\n**Thur, Aug 8 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (section 3, 3.4 - 3.5)\\n\\n0930-1130 Finished cohorts, reviewed study guide, took PA (Competent).\\n\\n1500-1800 Listened to all the recorded lessons while running/cleaning/cooking.\\n\\n1900-1930 **Not on the record** â€“ got worried and took the PA again (Exemplary, but the questions didnâ€™t change).\\n\\n**Fri, Aug 9 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0730 Ran through the study guide.\\n\\n0730-0830 Took the OA\\n\\nÂ \\n\\nExam experience: Awesome again. The only tool I used was the WGU whiteboard to write down the OSI layers + related protocols in the beginning. The OA was *very* similar to the PA for me and it only took me 30 minutes. I was a little worried going into it because I had read all the â€˜d315 â€“ failed my third attemptâ€™ posts, but I just read slow and used common sense if I couldnâ€™t remember the answer.\\n\\nI'm happy to answer any questions:) Moving on to C955, hoping to go a smidge faster since I like/am good at math.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4u7jmsa0ohd1.png?width=1914&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca59ad87eddca38448da7b706cf88c1f9c2767d4\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0hjcy61ohd1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4199a4a13a5d2ce88ee2753168f7df9b8010f965</td>\n",

Especially since there aren't exactly a ton of teen girls in this subreddit lol. \\n\\nA bit about me:\\n17 year old, fresh from HS (was homeschooled, so I'm pretty familier with online school/self motivation). This was my first Wgu class. It was mostly programming basics and since I took the Java mooc class before wgu (I didn't finish part two of that one though), I was very familiar with the programming parts of the class. The parts I had to learn were more which programming languages have what characteristics, sdlc and uml and how they work together with those confusing diagrams. \\n\\nHow long it took\\nTotal 8.5 hrs (according to my study bunny, great app) \\n\\nBreakdown:\\nAug 1: 6 hrs of studying (I did 3 bursts of 2 hrs each) \\n0700-0900 : zybooks 1.0-2.9 (read through all the way)\\n0930-1115 : zybooks 2.10 - 8.3 (started skimming through the basic programming parts)\\n1600-1815 : finished the zybooks (first hr), took the PA (30mins, Exemplary with one section suggested study), scheduled the OA for the next morning, did systems check + practice connection to proctor (everything was smooth except for when I cleared away all my papers and misplaced my ID, took me forever to find it). \\n\\nDid a quizelet set in the evening (mostly for a morale boost) (30ish mins):\\nWGU - Scripting and Programming Foundations Ñƒ Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/290541652/wgu-scripting-and-programming-foundations-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&amp;i=2dvpbg\\n\\n\\nAug 2: 2 hrs of studying \\n0700-0730 : review (read through the summaries of ch 8-9 and the suggested study chapters from yesterday's PA) and did an exam prep quizelet (D278 Exam Prep Ñƒ Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/784336947/d278-exam-prep-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&amp;i=2dvpbg)\\n0730-0900 : OA \\n\\nExam experience:\\nAwesome, connected to the proctor quickly and the room scan was no problem. My webcam didn't focus on my ID very well so he had me take a photo of it on my phone and zoom in so he could see, no biggie.\\nI used my wgu whiteboard and my scientific calculator for the exam, but you could make do with the in-app tools, too. \\n\\nMy parents are now wondering what sort of lazy-person university I got myself into that lets you pass a class in 8 hours, lol. Just kidding, kind of. \\n\\nI'm happy to answer any questions:)\\nMoving on to D315, definitely not expecting it to go this fast, lol.</td>\n",

that the class will be redesigned effective Aug 1st, so I imagine any progress I make between now and then will be lost, if I donâ€™t finish. \\n\\nI was planning to try and power through it that quickly, but have heard some horror stories about the class and how difficult it can be. Has anyone heard if the redesign will be better? Should I wait? Is 2 weeks a reasonable amount of time to complete C207 as is? \\n\\nThank you fellow night owls!  \n",

                                    C954 - Information Technology Management PASSED [80% 1.5 Wks]\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvw3i2qphh9b1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=1056aa8659d84f499c2cb150f68a973174cc8d91\\n\\nBefore taking this class I did extensive reading and scrolling through reviews and course chatter to see nothing but negativity and people saying it is THE hardest and LEAST structured class in the entire degree plan for MSITM. \\n\\nI want to make this post to say, if you are basing your study off of people saying things like this, **stop.**\\n\\nIt has made me way more stressed out than necessary too many times now with people over-complaining courses because they want to accelerate faster and not put any work in.\\n\\n(Ex: The amount of complaining about C777 - Web Development Applications , I overstressed that course but got a 90% score on my OA first try after a week, if you want my write up on that comment and I'll link it.)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**I passed with 1.5 Weeks of studying while working a full time job, here  is how:**\\n\\n\\-Download the ANKI Cards from Course Chatter, I used like 35% of them for the bigger topics, they are very helpful.\\n\\n\\- Read everything in the course material, if you think a topic may be familiar to you then read everything besides that section then take the PA (DO NOT LOOK AT THE ANSWERS YOU MISSED!) .\\n\\n*(DO NOT Be intimidated by the amount of reading, I have never read a book front to back in my life but made sure I sat down and thoroughly read everything, going over any confusing topics again 3-5x)*\\n\\n\\-If you did bad on the PA because of sections you didn't read, read those too. If you did well on sections you DID read, read them again.\\n\\n\\-Information Security should not be something you struggle with here, if you are this far, you have your Security+, and all of the security terms are repetition from that certification.\\n\\n\\-Three objectives make up 16%, 21%, and 29% of the exam respectively, focus on those the most.\\n\\n\\-Take all quizzes through the course material, after you read more, take the PA again (THIS TIME look at the answers you missed.)\\n\\n\\-After this, read more and more on what you are not comfortable with, then take the OA.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf it means anything I took it at 11PM for the best proctoring experience, since proctoring is horrible in the middle of the day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere are no useful external sources for this class, please stop rushing, you need to take your time with this class at the very least. \\n\\n*(Don't waste your time on quizlets, email your instructor for any resources they have the moment you click start course!)*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOverall, yes this class is very dense, but this information is EXTREMELY USEFUL for management, which is why you have this class to begin with. I started my job the same day I started this class, and saw so many things from this class brought up in the real IT environment.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDo not be afraid of your courses, embrace this experience even if you're an accelerator. I have completed 60 CUs in 4 months now, but this course humbled me and made me appreciate WGUs structure. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBest of luck to everybody taking this course after me, you WILL pass.  \n",

       Slow process..MBA HCM\\nIâ€™m currently in the MBA-HCM program. I started on 3/1 and Iâ€™ve only completed 3 courses so far (C200, AFT2, & C215) Iâ€™m currently in C213 and have about 16 weeks left. Is it possible to finish the last 7 courses in 15-16 weeks? I accelerated my bachelors last year. And idk why but  I donâ€™t have any motivation to study after working or the weekends ðŸ˜­ I told my family I planned to walk in Orlando in September for both degrees. But it seems like I canâ€™t get out of this cycle of procrastination. Anyone have any tips for C213 or the rest of the courses? Or how to get out of procrastination cycle? TIA ðŸ©µ  \n",

If I start slacking on school this will be the reason, lol.\\n\\nSep 19, Thursday  \\n0800-1000 : zybook 4.14 - 5.4  \\n1030-1230 : zybook 5.5 - 5.16  \\n1400-1600 : zybook 5.17 - 6.5\\n\\nSep 20, Friday  \\n0800-1000 : zybook practice test  \\n1030-1230 : PA - perfect, scheduled OA\\n\\nSep 21, Saturday  \\n0800-1030 : review labs 6 and 9, OA.\\n\\nNotes: I got one question wrong. The one with Random. The pa uses integers, but the oa wants you to generate random doubles within a range. I recommend being able to do that, as I spent 30 minutes trying to logic my way around it with no success before finally giving up. The OA is very, very similar to the PA. At least it was for me.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x795mc7ou6qd1.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=a09240a7162d3c1892d315c1e666ba4c6fb76f8c  \n",

       "14  Completed MSCSIA (Masters in Cybersecurity) in 40 days - it was challenging, not for everyone, many more would drop out, most would graduate in 1 year\\nI know, many hate to see such posts, but give me a chance. I'm in my mid-40s, have good IT background going back to high school (including programming in C, if anyone remembers that), have several small kids, work full time, and already have a Ph.D., as well as an undergrad from top universities (nationally and globally). \\n\\nSo going into this, I had many questions: WGU is radically different from anything I am used to - not making me comfortable.\\n\\nKnowing that CI's don't have any power and everything is evaluated anonymously, raised a lot of suspicions on my end.  \\n\\nReading horror stories about Examity didn't exactly inspire me. \\n\\nThe external camera requirement seemed like they were really going overboard. \\n\\n\"Will I have the time?\" That was a huge question, along with \"Do I really need this?\" These two questions underpinned everything for me. Basically, unless I could do this accredited and ranked degree in one semester, especially since I was paying for it myself, it was not worth it for me. \\n\\nHowever, I decided to take the plunge and transferred 3 classes due to already having CISM and CASP and other cyber certifications. I could have transferred 5 classes, but I decided to take CySA and Pentest while at WGU: it's cheaper that way plus I learn more. So I had to complete 7 remaining classes. I thought to myself: as long as I spend about 2 weeks per class, I should be able to do it in less that one semester/term. I need to complete everything before March ideally, since I have some major training for a different great program starting then.\\n\\nSo I start on Dec 1, but immediately get knocked down by an RSV from my youngest kid. As a result, the first 3 days are wasted laying in bed and being unable to concentrate. Very sad mood. So that took a lot of steam from under me, and now I got worried - Winter just started, and I was already down. \\n\\nPlus, now kids had a major change in schedule their coaches insisted on - they would now require more training time with their sports since they would be competing - which means I would be a part-time taxi service for them. So I had to read a lot of the WGU materials in the app, while sitting in the car with the heater on and off. As a note, I read all WGU materials, watched all videos, did half of all the labs, and read some of the books or chapters they assigned as optional reading. So I did not do what other accelerators do, which is go straight to the OA/PA. My goal was also to learn or refresh my skills somewhat, but certainly without exerting myself and without learning something completely from scratch (which is why I would not do a Masters in Computer Science, as I just don't want to learn some programming language - I know and understand enough of that, and won't be a programmer ever).\\n\\nOK, now started the first class, and followed the directions in one of the labs which said it required a paper, with screenshots. I did it, and proudly submitted to CI, only to find out that actually that lab in that class was not required at all - it was optional. So I wasted one (1) precious day of reading, following instructions, and writing a paper that was unnecessary. One day for me is significant - I'm a working adult. In one day I typically accomplish a lot. \"What a 'great' start!\" I am thinking to myself. \"Did you really need THIS? You don't have enough things in your life, you needed a 'challenge'?\"\\n\\nFinally, I got that class out of the way, and now felt better: I did it in less than the 2 weeks I allotted to myself per class. Now let's start the second and third classes - which require CySA exam and the Pentest exam. CySA was not hard for me since I already had more advanced CASP+, but Pentest+ was quite hard. I was really challenged, I thought it would be in the same league as Security+, but in reality, it's almost at the level of CASP+, and harder than CySA+. Thankfully, I prepared and refreshed my memory for a few days, and was familiar with Comptia exams. Otherwise, I don't know if I could have passed it on the first try. But getting vouchers, and then scheduling these exams takes time (I had to wait for 5 days for my CySA exam between scheduling it and actually taking it, for example, as Comptia was very busy in mid-December, before the holidays). After passing my exams I had to wait another 3 business days for exam results to be posted and classes to officially be completed. Without that, my mentor, who was not very experienced, was scared to allow me to register for more classes. The 2-days of weekends always had a negative effect as well, since it seemed like I submitted my papers or passed my Comptia exams on Friday's, thus having to wait longer (WGU allows 3 business days for grading, so in effect that could be 5 days with weekends).\\n\\nAnyhow, now I was done with 3 classes, and felt much better, but while waiting for these exam results, I started my 4th class, after convincing my mentor to allow me to take it - and submitted the paper that required me to use their incident response template. The \"originality report\" did not show the results of the check for over 24 hours, and I just went ahead and submitted it without it. The evaluator kicked it back, accusing me of plagiarism, since the checker ended up showing that the paper was 50% \"similar.\" I was still not familiar with all WGU processes, and it took me a while to understand how to navigate and read their evaluation reports, as well as \"similarity\" reports. I understood that the evaluator was totally inexperienced and forgot to exclude the text of the template from the checker - thus of course my paper was \"similar\". Then the names of the people, the names of the machine, the IP addresses -- all of this unavoidable and required information was also \"similar\" and evaluator forgot to exclude. \\n\\nSo now I have a crisis on my hands - I have a black mark on me and thanks to the incompetence of the anonymous evaluator I'm in deep trouble. I start remembering my initial hesitation with WGU precisely because of these anonymous evaluators and tell myself, \"See, you were right to think and predict this, but you didn't listen to yourself! Now go and waste your time dealing with this lemon!\" And dealing I did: I wrote protest emails to two officials at WGU, with a detailed analysis of what happened and what their evaluator did wrong. I called their assessment team and could barely contain my anger, explaining what happened. The lady on the line was very sympathetic to what happened, and felt like she understood the problem, but could only refer it to the anonymous evaluators, whose names and phones she doesn't have. I was very angry, and mentor was not helpful. But the next day an assistant dean wrote to me, said they investigated, agreed with me, accepted the paper, and removed the black mark from my name, clearing the record (yes, once you are accused of plagiarism they keep tabs on you). \\n\\nWhile I won, this wasted at least another working day from me, and caused a lot of stress I didn't need or deserve. As I mentioned earlier, I am very sensitive to even one wasted day. But now I completed 4 classes, and had just 3 more remaining, including Capstone. I'm thinking to myself - OK, I'm doing well, it looks like I can complete the degree in 30 days total.\\n\\nSo I started D485 -- and hit a brick wall. While I was trying to understand the requirements of this class' assignment, I asked to do D487, which I completed in a few days. But now all I had between me and the Capstone was D485. Calling IT help desk, or the student services, or mentor, or even CI, didn't help. Everything I found online was somewhat helpful, but not a lot, and nothing could bypass the need to learn Azure. Which I really didn't want to, since we use AWS, things change too quickly (case in point: Azure renamed Active Directory to Entra ID just a few months ago, while lab still shows AD), and I'm in the management. I paid my dues sort of speak, and don't need to be a sysadmin or cloudadmin Level II. I understand it enough, I really don't need to create RGs in Azure. But to pass this class it was essential, and I forced myself to watch everything there was. Since having work, kids, sports, etc., it took me 4 days to watch Pluralsight and read Azure's own training, and since the lab doesn't save the results and is slow, I had to go in, and redo settings 5-6 times.   \\n\\n\\nAbout CI's: the CI tried to be helpful, with tips and cohort recordings (and same is true of all other classes, where CI's try to be helpful, but are really limited on what they can do. Indeed, they are probably as helpful as any professor in any online program in most universities). So I really liked the CIs, but they are severely limited. That's something WGU must change in the future if it really wants to become a Top 50 university.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well. But I was able to start Capstone basically after NY, it took them 1 day to approve Task 1, then I submitted Task 2, and it was kicked back, since I didn't understand - as it's not really in the requirements - that I have to write as if my company has been hacked, i.e., there was some kind of a cyberincident. That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well.

It took mentor 2 days to submit paperwork for graduation.  \\n\\n\\nSo the end result: I am glad I took the plunge, and did this quickly and on budget. It was definitely not easy, had I been 20-something, it would have taken me the full 6 months, even though I was sharper, faster, and had boundless energy back then. I'm slower, and can't concentrate anymore, but I'm also smarter, more focused, methodical, and disciplined (not much social life helps). It was definitely worth it for me because of this, and thank you to WGU for creating and maintaining a regionally accredited degree that's ranked high and keeps improving, with strict anti-plagiarism measures and external cameras to nip critics in the bud and maintain the value of the degree. I say this despite being a victim of the unprofessionalism of one particular overzealous evaluator, or having many other things I could criticize. This program is on par with programs at most other universities (except the most select).   \\n\\n\\nThus, I did it in 40 days, would have done it in 30 days, and if I knew WGU processes and was luckier, then maybe even in 20 days. **But** I also know that less than 1% can complete a degree quickly, and for every such accelerator there are 10 who drop out, and 90% who finish on regular schedule. It was a challenging program - Capstone was not easy but super fun nevertheless (that's the geek in me), D485 I will remember forever (I hated it, but hugely respect it and will always tell this story to my kids), and other classes that required you to draw network diagrams or do Examity proctored exams, made it very challenging, since had to learn new skills or refresh long-forgotten Visio skills, and had very little direction and explanation from WGU. Yet there was no need for busywork, no unnecessary stretching of the program or overloading the student with 10 books per class. So it's perfect for a working professional, who doesn't have the time of the 20-something full-time student (or even part-time student -- you guys, if you think you are \"busy\", wait until you marry, have kids, senior position at work, and other social obligations).   \\n\\n\\nI would love for WGU to make a few improvements, so I could take another degree or two from it:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1) give CI's more power, and make them assistant professors at least. Let them publish research. This will improve rankings. And allow students to pair up with professors to publish research jointly, based on the capstone project.\\n\\n2) anonymous evaluators are not cool. I get the perceived need for that, but WGU should not be CIA.\\n\\n3) update the curriculum! (The OSI model is ridiculous, for example, and has always been controversial. It is unnecessary when there is a TCP/IP model which is actually used. Where is anything on blockchains? Crypto? Adversarial AI/ML? Post-quantum cryptography? SD-WANs?) Yes, it's not bad compared to other universities, but compare yourselves to Georgia Tech, MIT, Johns Hopkins, etc. This will improve the ranking further.\\n\\n4) require papers for every class. Even if these classes have Comptia exams.\\n\\n5) clarify all requirements and put them all in one document. Please don't say \"they already are.\" No, they are not. We can test it - WGU officials in charge should write a paper, and submit to me, and see what will happen.\\n\\n6) Mentors have too much power at the expense of the students. A lot of WGU students are working adults. We should not need to ask permission to register for classes. I should be able to start 4 classes at once if I want. It's my risk, my transcript, my life. And I paid for it already. \\n\\n7) Gain more and better accreditations for IT, Business, and other colleges and programs. \\n\\n8) Allow students to enroll in two programs at once - for example, IT and nursing. Not dual degree, but keep them as two separate programs, two separate degrees. Just allow them to be taken concurrently, not \"finish and graduate from one, and only then start the second one\". Again, we are adults, we know what we want and what we can. Every month and every day matters for us. If I finish/graduate on September 6, it means I can only start my studies in a new program at WGU on November 1. But if I would have been able to graduate by September 5, I could start on October 1. Just one day, and such a huge effect. \\n\\n9) Improve the orientation class. Right now it's very long and cumbersome. Make it shorter, and have a clear \"quick start\" guide that has everything we need on it. Right now everything is clunky, orientation is a waste of time, and for some reason it pollutes our transcripts, by being listed on it as a zero-credit class. Totally unnecessary to include zero credit, non-academic \"course\" which is not a course on it. \\n\\nSo recruiters and HR reading this: this is a very legit degree, that's more challenging than most others, yet can be had in a matter of weeks, not a year like others. Graduates of this program actually learn smth, and can do things, unlike most graduates of other programs who learn theory and would quickly forget or get confused within weeks of graduation. \\n\\nThank you all, this forum and its members have been great.\\n\\n&#x200B;  \n",

                     Why does BS in IT need C777 - Web Development Applications?\\nSorry if this was repeated. /\\n\\nI just don't understand why this is more beneficial in an IT professionals tool belt then lets say,  SQL. I think i seen in the past the curriculum included SQL, but the current curriculum does not appear to include SQL at the time of this writing.  \\n\\n\\nSo why do you guys think C777 is required in a BS in IT at WGU?  \n",

D315 network and security foundations in a week, or about 10-12 direct hours of studying.\\ny\\n\\n**Post will be jumbled as i just took the test, the professor emails you a list of study**\\n\\nEdit: also know the difference between symmetric and assemetric keys (sorry for spelling) \\n\\nI focused in on what other posts said , really nailing down the OSI layer, CIA, AAA, understanding the network devices and where they take place in the OSI layers. really need to know the functions at each layer. very tricky wording sometimes. the PA or maybe the study-guide actually had some of the same questions. Really wish i would have studied more specifics about firewall, antivirus, worms viruses, etc and what they do and what they effect, as i feel it would have made the questions simple. \\n\\nlots of OSI layer questions, lots of cable questions, network device questions. maybe 3-4 network commands. question on red team/blue team stuff. security questions dealt with preventing and diagnosing (what are they trying to hurt) most of the security questions related to CIA, AAA. There were a couple one off questions but it all dealt with the above topics. a few on LAN/WAN etc. Know the cloud infrastructures SAAS PASS IAAS, and basic security concerns there. \\n\\nso OSI layer questions were focused on order, and what happens in that space. \\n\\nEverything was more in-depth then I would have thought. like i really had to know what the network devices did. cables were really focused on what's most common and where its used. UTP, coaxial, came up. brain dump at the beginning the OSI layer, AAA, CIA, as those were a lot of questions themselves. really understand the difference in the network topology's, especially terms like Access point, and what device refers too. bus, mesh, ring, star where what came up.  \\n\\nwish i studied more about firewalls and security in general, this guide, maybe need to touch more on the security stuff but overall prepares you quite well. Though i just barely passed, i also did not spend even a week on it. but that's not to say i didnt really focus on taking the PA, studying based off it, and took the PA 2 more times till I basically got a 100. and then honed in on the study-guide.

Take with a grain of salt cause alot overlapped. \\n\\n**AAA**\\n\\n**CIA**\\n\\n**attacker and virus/worm/trojan things (know what they do and how to fix them)**\\n\\n**network devices (network, router, switch, bridge, know what layer they operate and what they do)**\\n\\n**topology questions** \\n\\n**Cables (common types, when is it used)**\\n\\n**risk management questions:** i did not study this. \\n\\n**network commands**\\n\\n**Cloud infrastructure. (who would use what, and know some common cloud security concerns.)**\\n\\n**LAN/WAN/etc (how do they work, how far it goes and what connects it)**\\n\\n**Know the difference between hypervisor 1 and 2: bareback**\\n\\n**Know the difference between IDS/IPS**  \n",

program and only have a few classes left before I begin my Capstone project. I have User Interface Design c773, Web Development Foundations c779 and lastly Web Development Applications c777 left after I test out of my current class in the next day or so.\\n\\nIs there a preferred order to these classes? Would it be beneficial to complete the user interface design first before hitting up the web development classes or vise versa complete the web dev classes first and leave the user interface design class last? Is there any carry over of these that completing one first will assist in the other or does it really matter at all? Thanks  \n",

  Extra help for Intro Python D335\\nHello everyone,  I'm two classes away from graduation. Looking to be done in the next month if it goes right. On my last hard course being D335. Seems much more straight forward compared to intro to applications (didn't grasp SQL too well but got er done). I completed the first 5-6 chapters of Zybooks material. Got through 14 sections of Angela Yus 100 days of programming. Went through all the Chapter 34 labs and starting to rinse and repeat the labs till they are on the back of my hand. I have had my studying cut out for me and have been going hard at it but I really want to pass the OA on the first try. What tips and extra tricks would you all recommend for the Python OA? I know it's extremely similar to the pre-asessment which I have gone through a few times already but I want to be completely prepared. Not the hardest class I have faced by far but that doesn't mean I want it to drag out. I'm ready to be done with it. 3 weeks of studying and I want it to pay out. Thanks WGU members ðŸ˜„  \n",

                                C207\\nAfter reading some of the reviews here about Data Driven Decision Making, I am really nervous about this class! I liked WGU's undergrad stat class (as much as one can \"like\" statistics lol). And all of my MBA classes so far have been really straight forward. Apparently that's not the case with C207? The course mentor I communicated with said that the pre-assessment and the assessment pull questions from the same question bank, but most of the reviews I've read tell a different story.\\n\\nAny thoughts/tips/tricks to passing both the OA and the tasks for this class would be really appreciated!  \n",

             (C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers) Are Pre-Assessment Retakes always the same?\\nI recently took the pre-assessment for C213 Accounting for Decision Makers twice because I wanted to be absolutely sure I was good to go before taking the OA and the second one was exactly the same as the first one with answers just rearranged. Is that always the case and does that mean the OAs repeat of you would have to retake them?  \n",

I know that posts about accelerating are frustrating to some people on this sub. This post is not to suggest that my process is the best or the only way to approach this degree. The benefit of WGU is that it's useful to people in a number of different situations. If you're not accelerating, this post may not be helpful for you. You'll notice that my focus is on passing the final assessment in the most efficient way, not necessarily on learning as much as possible.\\n\\nFor a bit more context about myself, this is actually my 2nd BS degree which meant I only had to take the IT-specific courses. I don't think I could have possibly done the degree in 6 months if I also had to take the general ed courses. I also have a decent amount of experience in this field; I've been a high school computer science teacher for 7 years and have taught IT, Linux, Python, Web Dev, Cybersecurity, and AWS courses for a number of years.\\n\\nThis is also my second WGU degree. I accelerated a WGU Masters in Instructional Design in one term a few years back, then I got my Doctorate in education, then I started this IT degree in September 2023. Having an IT degree makes me eligible for a yearly stipend as a teacher which is why I wanted to get this degree.\\n\\nI tracked everything in a spreadsheet as I progressed through the program, including the total hours I spent on each class and resources that I found most helpful. I found a lot of good tips here on Reddit and I wanted to pay it forward by sharing my own experience as well.\\n\\n**General advice:**\\n\\n* Use Chat-GPT to study! Anytime you see a term that you don't understand, ask Chat-GPT to explain it to you. This is absolutely the best way to quickly wrap your mind around some of these concepts. I always had a Chat-GPT window up while I was studying.\\n* For all WGU classes (the non-certification courses) you should take the pre-assessment (PA) before doing anything else. Then check your coaching report and study any areas that are marked with the yellow \"Approaching Competence\" score. Once you understand why you got those pre-assessment questions wrong, take the objective assessment (OA). You get two free attempts, so it's worth it to take the first attempt quickly. If you fail, your instructor will email you with a few specific things to study, and once you do that you'll be more than ready for the second attempt.\\n* For all the certification classes (ITIL, A+, Linux, AWS, PM+, Net+, Sec+) I found three things to be the most helpful: the Professor Messer YouTube playlist for that exam, the Jason Dion 6 Practice Exam Udemy course, and the Sybex book and online practice questions. **Don't use CertMaster.** The questions suck and are nothing like the actual exam questions.\\n* Jason Dion has 6 practice exams for each certification. Take each one of them, but be sure to review the explanations for each question you get wrong before taking the next exam. Use Chat-GPT to explain things you don't understand. If you have to pay for the Udemy course remember that you can get a full refund within 30 days.\\n\\n**Intro to IT - D322:**\\n\\n* This class took me two hours. I passed my PA on the first try and immediately scheduled the OA. This class is a good measure of how quickly you could accelerate this degree - if this class is easy for you, you likely already have the fundamental IT knowledge required to accelerate more classes.\\n\\n**Business of IT - Applications - D336 (ITIL certification):**\\n\\n* This class took three hours.  I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/t9khiz/business_of_it_applications_c846passed/) to be very helpful. I would describe the ITIL certification as a corporate lingo cert. Focus on understanding the ITIL-specific context of each term and concept and you'll be fine. These terms are also used in the PM+, Net+, and Sec+ exams you'll take in the future so this is a great time to get familiar with them.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Foundations - D315:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour. [This study guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mgo-OBPx24RTJ46Qay2WUzg8P3CGRmO0/view) is perfect and has everything you need to know. Spend as much time as you need on this study guide, as all the material you study here overlaps heavily with the A+, Net+, and Sec+ exams you'll take later. MEMORIZE THE OSI LAYERS NOW. You'll need to memorize them anyway, so you might as well do it now.\\n\\n**IT Applications - D317 (A+ core 2 certification):**\\n\\n* This class took me 15 hours. I watched [this Messer Core 2 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MHDU4kFChU&list=PLG49S3nxzAnna96gzhJrzkii4hH_mgW4b) on 1.75 speed and used [Dion's Udemy Core 2 exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-220-1102-core-2-practice-exams-new-for-2022/) to practice. I didn't use the [Sybex book](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Complete-Deluxe-Study-Guide/dp/1119515963) for this class, but if you need extra study material I highly recommend their stuff.\\n\\n**Organizational Behavior and Leadership - C484:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour and was by far the easiest class in the whole program. I don't have any background in Organizational Behavior but everything here was easy common sense stuff. If you're a good test taker you could pass this exam without any studying.\\n\\n**Spreadsheets - C268:**\\n\\n* This class took 2 hours. The OA is identical to the PA; they just changed the numbers in the spreadsheet. If you know how to do everything for the PA spreadsheet you'll be fine on the OA.\\n\\n**Scripting and Programming - Foundations - D278:**\\n\\n* This took me 1 hour. I've taught programming for years so I didn't have to study for this one. The Zybooks material provided by WGU is a great way to learn this for beginners.\\n\\n**Web Development Foundations - D276:**\\n\\n* This class also took me 1 hour. I've taught Web Development for years so I didn't need to study for this one either. The Zybooks material is great for this class as well.\\n\\n**IT Foundations - D316 (A+ core 1 certification):**\\n\\n* This class took 22 hours. Once again, I watched the [Messer Core 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87t6P5ZHTP0&list=PLG49S3nxzAnnOmvg5UGVenB_qQgsh01uC) playlist on 1.75 speed and used [Dion's Udemy Core 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-220-1101-core-1-practice-exams-new-for-2022/) exams to practice. I didn't use the [Sybex book](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Complete-Deluxe-Study-Guide/dp/1119515963) here, but it's great if you need additional study material.\\n\\n**Web Development Applications - C777:**\\n\\n* This class took 3 hours. I don't have any specific tips here, just take the PA, study your weak areas, and take the OA.\\n\\n**Linux Foundations - D281:**\\n\\n* This class took me 10 hours. This is the only exam I failed on my first try. The most useful study guide is the official [one published by LPI](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/010-160/) \\- spin up a Linux VM and run all the commands in the study guide. [Shawn Powers'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skTShEHyXfo&list=PL78ppT-_wOmvlYSfyiLvkrsZTdQJ7A24L) YouTube playlist was decent. After I failed my first attempt I attended a review session with the instructor which was very helpful.\\n\\n**User Interface Design - C773:**\\n\\n* This class took 5 hours. Make sure to use the links in the \"Course Tips\" section where you can see examples and other resources. Be sure to follow the rubric exactly. Don't try to get too fancy with anything. Just do exactly what the rubric is asking for. Remember that the evaluators probably don't have much IT knowledge; they're just looking to see if the rubric item is present in your submission.\\n\\n**Information Systems Management - C724:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour. It's another straightforward class where you should immediately take the PA, study your weak areas, then take the OA.\\n\\n**Cloud Foundations - D282 (AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner):**\\n\\n* I earned this cert several years ago so I didn't have to take this class. I don't have any tips for accelerating.\\n\\n**Business of IT - Project Management - D324 (Project+ certification):**\\n\\n* This class took 20 hours, and was probably my least favorite class. I couldn't find a good YouTube playlist for this class, so the majority of my study time was spent on the [Sybex Project+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Project-Study-Guide-PK0-005-ebook/dp/B0BCZTHL6R/ref=sr_1_1?crid=29FKNHHW6LMZ4&keywords=sybex+project%2B&qid=1707755705&s=books&sprefix=sybex+project%2B%2Cstripbooks%2C143&sr=1-1), their online question bank, and the [Dion practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-project-pk0-005-practice-exams-a/).\\n\\n**Data Management - Foundations - D426:**\\n\\n* This class took me 7 hours. I didn't have any prior experience with SQL so all the content here was very new to me. I did 100% of the Zybooks material and also used the [DataCamp.com](https://app.datacamp.com/search?q=sql&technology=SQL) SQL courses. You can sign into [DataCamp.com](https://DataCamp.com) with your WGU email and get everything there for free.\\n\\n**Data Management - Applications - D427:**\\n\\n* This class took 5 hours. I did all the Zybooks material and more of the [DataCamp.com](https://DataCamp.com) exercises.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies - C850:**\\n\\n* This class took me 1 hour. My first submission didn't pass, but I just used the feedback from the first submission to make a few quick changes and my second submission passed. Use the WGU curriculum to make sure you're doing the Gartner STREET process correctly.\\n\\n**Networks - D325 (Network+ certification):**\\n\\n* This class took 30 hours, but I actually enjoyed studying for this class. Networking is really cool when you start understanding how it all works. I watched [Messer's Network+ playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As6g6IXcVa4&list=PLG49S3nxzAnlCJiCrOYuRYb6cne864a7G) on 1.75 speed, used the [Sybex Network+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Network-Study-Guide-Authorized/dp/1119811635/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1JKBP8OEE9TH0&keywords=sybex+network%2B&qid=1707756879&s=books&sprefix=sybex+network%2B%2Cstripbooks%2C158&sr=1-3), their online question bank, and [Dion's 6 Network+ practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-network-008-exams/). I was scoring in the 70% range on the Dion exams and passed the real exam on my first try.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications - D329 (Security+ certification):**\\n\\n* This one took 25 hours. I watched [Messer's Security+ playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NE33fpQuw8&list=PLG49S3nxzAnkL2ulFS3132mOVKuzzBxA8) on 1.75 speed, used the [Sybex Security+ study guide](https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-Security-Study-Guide-SY0-601/dp/1119736250/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3A8HIFHEDTDYN&keywords=sybex+security%2B&qid=1707757100&s=books&sprefix=sybex+security%2B%2Cstripbooks%2C101&sr=1-4), their online question bank, and [Dion's 6 Security+ practice exams](https://www.udemy.com/course/security-601-exams/). I was scoring in the 70% range on the Dion exams and passed the real exam on my first try.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project - C769:**\\n\\n* This only took about an hour because I used a project I had already done, so all I really needed to do was the write-ups for it. Just use the templates provided by WGU and make sure you meet each rubric requirement.  \n",

                  Obtaining Security+ cert prior to taking D315 and D329\\nIs a student enrolled in the BSIT program obtains the CompTIA Security+ cert prior to taking D315 and D329 would still have to take and pass the D315 OA? I understand in order to pass D329 you would have to actually pass the Security + exam. Would there be additions steps needed with either of these in order to get credit for the courses in the BAIT program?  \n",

Or wait and take it at WGU?\\nI'm planning to start the Data Analytics B.S. at WGU on August 1. Right now, I'm waiting to see what courses might be picked up from my community college transcript, and I've signed up at sophia .org to knock out a few Gen Ed classes that I \\*know\\* won't be transferred from that pending transcript evaluation. \\n\\nOne of the WGU courses I'm not sure about is D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations. I have three Python programming courses on that pending transcript, but I don't know that any of them will cover D278. I also have years of work experience with Python, PowerShell, and Ruby scripting, so I'm not worried about understanding the material, just getting credit for the class.\\n\\nIf I don't get the transfer credit, I'm trying to decide whether to take the sophia .org equivalent course (CS1101: Introduction to Java Programming) to get transfer credit, or just wait and take D278 at WGU. \\n\\nDoes D278 use Java? Python? Or is it all pseudocode? \\n\\nAre there graded assignments? Or just an OA?  \n",

section of reading, you'll have to hunt and guess which ones are relevant. \\n\\nI think this course is a bit premature when it comes to the degree plan so if you're new to Computer Science, I recommend moving this one down to after you've had a few programming courses under your belt. \\n\\nEDIT: I'm further on in the program now and if you haven't taken C949 Data Structures and Algorithms I yet, that course is a better introduction to some of these concepts than this book. It's an excellent introduction to CS and if you're a beginner like me, you'll benefit from at least reading through chapter 9 or 10 before starting this class. Also watch this series to understand memory better. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bum_19loj9A&index=1&list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H\\n\\nThis course assumes you know enough about programming to follow code samples in C to learn aspects of assembly language (LEGv8). The OA also includes questions on finding the equivalent C code to some LEGv8 code snippets. I don't think you need to be an expert but spend some time to gain familiarity in the code if you aren't coming in with a background in either programming or C (the c949 book mentioned above offers a lot of practice in following code in general which is really useful). This is the lecture series I used. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NWeucMKrLI&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAKIXv8Yr6nhGJ9Vlcjyymq  \\n\\nHere is a crash course in Assembly Language which is good for getting a big-picture view of chapter 3.  \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75gBFiFtAb8  \\n\\nChapter 2 is deceivingly simple. Chapters 3 and 4 are VERY intimidating; beware of rabbit hole syndrome! I struggled more than I should have because I didn't know how much I needed to know C until I had already invested a lot of time pushing through chapters 3 and 4. I think even with a short background in C the chapters are grueling and freakishly long. But you'll read it with more confidence and direction if you first take the time to be familiar with C beforehand. \\n\\nHopefully the course will come out with a study guide along with some C and ARMv8 cohorts at some point. \\n\\nMake sure you study memory, cache, armv8 code, pipelining, and parallel processing. Have a good idea of what arithmetic operations to use: when and how they work, what causes a data hazard, and how loads and stores work, etc. \\n\\nEDIT: More sources posted by another student, so good that I wanted to link it here - https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/d2rl7j/computer_architecture_c952_passed_w_additional/\\n\\nEDIT: I wanted to add a book suggestion. It's not class related which is why I'm putting it at the bottom ... If you want to understand and be able to integrate the material in this course, give Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Harris a read. WGU presents its topics as somewhat disjoint concepts and this book integrates them in a way that Zybooks fails to. However, don't read it until after you've completed Discrete Math I (you'll need to know your boolean algebra and have a basic understanding of proofs to get through it). For what it's worth. \\n\\nP.S. Join slack if you need more help or want to connect with other BSCS students - https://join.slack.com/t/wgu-itpros/signup  \n",

minutes ago.\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anolygnkvfxc1.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=c770b8e0162b72265f19f6d256dbff2a0a414d46\\n\\nI'm confident that I rolled the exam lottery and got the easier exam. My term ends in two days and I started studying less than a week ago, however I've studied probably 30 hours since then. The bulk of it was forcing myself to read through the Zybook. I honestly wished I had read the \"Course Tips\" on the class page, because I would have saved time by NOT reading the following sections:\\n\\n**Not Required/Optional lessons:**Â Lesson 3.9, 5.2, 5.6, lesson 6 and lessons 8\\n\\nI however only read chapters 1-4, answering all of the practice questions as well as the labs and the end of chapter questions. I read chapter 5, but did none of the problems in blue and read nothing else.\\n\\nI also reviewed the Performance Assessment as well as reading the guide from the course chatter, which I then converted the entire document into a quizlett located at:\\n\\n[https://quizlet.com/909651312/d426-data-management-foundation-objective-assessment-practice-exam-flash-cards/?i=45jaix&x=1jqt](https://quizlet.com/909651312/d426-data-management-foundation-objective-assessment-practice-exam-flash-cards/?i=45jaix&x=1jqt)\\n\\nEverything I tested on was is in the readings and the Quizlet (you can use it as a flash cards or turn it into test mode using the 7 day free trial, which is what I did.)\\n\\nNow I have two days to study for D427 and pass then pass the OA before midnight on the 30th. So wish me luck, because I spent the time reading all the Zybook garbage for D426, hoping it would work as study material for D427.  \n",

[here](https://wgu.udemy.com/learning-paths/3244898/). The videos seem similar, [with one using older versions and being longer](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/10551206#overview), while the [other is shorter and uses more newer versions](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-hibernate-tutorial/learn/lecture/36828980#overview). Many of these topics seem similar w/ some minute difference, at least at first glance. Which one did u guys end up using(planning to use) or was it a mix and match combination? If so please let me know the order cause I really don't want to rewatch materials for 80+ hrs.  \n",

thought I'd meet the 2.75 gpa requirement. I did but was told to take a single course for admission. I enrolled into Ethics in Technology (D333A) thinking it would be easy (oops). \\n\\nI already talked to my enrollment counselor and success counselor about this. Any tips for the Ethics in Technology course in WGU Academy just in case I have to finish the course? I noticed the Academy courses are a bit different than the regular ones.  \n",

find everything available out there before they start. I'm just giving a rundown of the timeline for my courses. Specifics on courses are found all over reddit, which has been really helpful. Just search the course number when you start the course.\\n\\nI completed the BS in Business Administration, Accounting in October 2023. I transferred in an Associates in Business, and I had 65 credit units to complete (22 classes total). I completed them all in one 6 month term. I was working super full time as a Practice Manager, including a daily commute. I also have a husband and two kids (teenagers). It was NOT easy. I got up at 5am a lot and worked basically every night and every weekend on school. I did take a couple of weeks off during the term.  I am self-pay, so I was super motivated not to pay for another term.\\n\\nThe photo of the course dates makes it look like I completed several courses later in the program in a day or so, but I was working on 2-3 courses at a time, so the end dates for some just ended up being really close together.  (If you show your mentor that you are accelerating, they shouldn't have a problem adding two courses at a time to your term after the initial four.) The first week of courses were fast. I had access to some of the course material a couple weeks before my term started. (I was clicking around on the WGU app in the courses and found that some allowed me to view the material before the term.)\\n\\nI took several months off school after graduating, quit my job (changing careers), and started a tax preparer internship in February. I started the MS Accounting program March 1, 2024. After tax season, I basically didn't have anything to do except school. I could have gotten this done a lot sooner than the 6 months, but I heard that it doesn't get you your transcripts any faster (which is what I need for the CPA cert). If your accounting is pretty fresh, it's not a hard program. \\n\\nPic with the most courses is the BS term.

I've been working on C213 all month but wanted to see if anyone had any extra suggestions on \"Things to absolutely know\" before taking the OA? Is the PA easier or harder than the OA.\\n\\nAny and all insights are appreciated as I always psych myself out for test.  \n",

how I am going to efficiently study and memorize the material (Newer to the IT field).\\n\\nIâ€™m trying to tackle the flash card games, the PBQs, and the Practice questions before I even read the material to gauge what I do and donâ€™t know (hardly know any answers) but I feel like Iâ€™m memorizing the answers well and not remembering the actual material. Any tips or tricks? I need to pass both A+ classes by April to keep my job. \\n\\nThank you!  \n",

My term ends April 30th, so I am feeling the stress of the time crunch to complete this class. I'm not sure what steps to take now, besides getting with the CI. I studied, did the labs and class material, ppt, extra videos, etc. Feeling defeated right now. Any suggestions on how to improve so I can pass? Thanks  \n",

In my next term I have two courses left before my capstone - C211 and AMT2. They're both scheduled for next term rn, but I have time to move one to this term and complete it this month. Of these two courses, is there one you recommend? I don't think I'm stronger in OA or PA, probably pretty even so that's not the deciding factor for me. I did search the courses in here and couldn't really get enough info to help me make this decision, so just wanted to see if anyone had any input on which they found easier! Thanks!  \n",

                                              One week, passed D315 â€“ Network and Security Foundations (ft. my study bunny)\\nHello everyone, I finished my second WGU class today. D315 â€“ Network and Security Foundations. I'm posting because I like reading/replying to comments, gives me a bit of accountability, and maybe someone will find useful information here.\\n\\nA bit about my situation: 17 years old, started WGU for the BS in CompSci on Aug 1. I definitely (intentionally) over-studied for this class, I went through *all* the course materials (there were some pretty long chapters to read), watched all 4 cohorts, and watched the recorded lessons (v2). Because I am a full-time student (no job at the moment) and donâ€™t mind the study process, I was able to go through all the material and pass the class within a week. Clearly, depending on how much you already know, how much time you spend studying, and how easily you can memorize terms/definitions/standards, it will take you more/less time.\\n\\nHow long it took - 31 hrs total (according to my study bunny, second photo).\\n\\nBreakdown:\\n\\n**Fri, Aug 2 -**\\n\\n2.5 hours of studying - started the class. (I finished my previous class this day).\\n\\n**Sat, Aug 3 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (section 1, 1.5 â€“ 1.7), + first 20 minutes of cohort 1.\\n\\n1030-1230 Course materials (section 1, 1.7 â€“ 3.2).\\n\\n1400-1600 course materials (section 1, 3.3 - 4.1), + second 20 minutes of cohort 1.\\n\\n**Sun, Aug 4 â€“ Rest day.**\\n\\n**Mon, Aug 5 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (finished section 1).\\n\\n0930-1130 Course materials (section 2, 1 - 1.2).\\n\\n1300-1500 Course materials (section 2, 1.3 - 1.4), + first half of cohort 2.\\n\\n**Tue, Aug 6 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (finished section 2), + second half of cohort 2, course materials (section 3, 1-1.5)\\n\\n0930-1130 Course materials (section 3, 1.6 - 2.7).\\n\\n1300-1500 Course materials (section 3, 2.8-3.2)\\n\\n**Wed, Aug 7 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (section 3, 3.3).\\n\\n0930-1030 Course materials (section 3, half of 3.4).\\n\\n**Thur, Aug 8 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0900 Course materials (section 3, 3.4 - 3.5)\\n\\n0930-1130 Finished cohorts, reviewed study guide, took PA (Competent).\\n\\n1500-1800 Listened to all the recorded lessons while running/cleaning/cooking.\\n\\n1900-1930 **Not on the record** â€“ got worried and took the PA again (Exemplary, but the questions didnâ€™t change).\\n\\n**Fri, Aug 9 â€“**\\n\\n0700-0730 Ran through the study guide.\\n\\n0730-0830 Took the OA\\n\\nÂ \\n\\nExam experience: Awesome again. The only tool I used was the WGU whiteboard to write down the OSI layers + related protocols in the beginning. The OA was *very* similar to the PA for me and it only took me 30 minutes. I was a little worried going into it because I had read all the â€˜d315 â€“ failed my third attemptâ€™ posts, but I just read slow and used common sense if I couldnâ€™t remember the answer.\\n\\nI'm happy to answer any questions:) Moving on to C955, hoping to go a smidge faster since I like/am good at math.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4u7jmsa0ohd1.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca59ad87eddca38448da7b706cf88c1f9c2767d4\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw0hjcy61ohd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4199a4a13a5d2ce88ee2753168f7df9b8010f965  \n",

   New Student, Passed D278\\nHello everyone, these types of posts are so helpful, so I decided to contribute. Especially since there aren't exactly a ton of teen girls in this subreddit lol. \\n\\nA bit about me:\\n17 year old, fresh from HS (was homeschooled, so I'm pretty familier with online school/self motivation). This was my first Wgu class. It was mostly programming basics and since I took the Java mooc class before wgu (I didn't finish part two of that one though), I was very familiar with the programming parts of the class. The parts I had to learn were more which programming languages have what characteristics, sdlc and uml and how they work together with those confusing diagrams. \\n\\nHow long it took\\nTotal 8.5 hrs (according to my study bunny, great app) \\n\\nBreakdown:\\nAug 1: 6 hrs of studying (I did 3 bursts of 2 hrs each) \\n0700-0900 : zybooks 1.0-2.9 (read through all the way)\\n0930-1115 : zybooks 2.10 - 8.3 (started skimming through the basic programming parts)\\n1600-1815 : finished the zybooks (first hr), took the PA (30mins, Exemplary with one section suggested study), scheduled the OA for the next morning, did systems check + practice connection to proctor (everything was smooth except for when I cleared away all my papers and misplaced my ID, took me forever to find it). \\n\\nDid a quizelet set in the evening (mostly for a morale boost) (30ish mins):\\nWGU - Scripting and Programming Foundations Ñƒ Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/290541652/wgu-scripting-and-programming-foundations-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&i=2dvpbg\\n\\n\\nAug 2: 2 hrs of studying \\n0700-0730 : review (read through the summaries of ch 8-9 and the suggested study chapters from yesterday's PA) and did an exam prep quizelet (D278 Exam Prep Ñƒ Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/784336947/d278-exam-prep-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&i=2dvpbg)\\n0730-0900 : OA \\n\\nExam experience:\\nAwesome, connected to the proctor quickly and the room scan was no problem. My webcam didn't focus on my ID very well so he had me take a photo of it on my phone and zoom in so he could see, no biggie.\\nI used my wgu whiteboard and my scientific calculator for the exam, but you could make do with the in-app tools, too. \\n\\nMy parents are now wondering what sort of lazy-person university I got myself into that lets you pass a class in 8 hours, lol. Just kidding, kind of. \\n\\nI'm happy to answer any questions:)\\nMoving on to D315, definitely not expecting it to go this fast, lol.  \n",

I came into this class with no SQL experience. I finished D426 last weekend and just passed applications(D427) 5 minutes ago. I came back to say, if you take good notes for D426, practice, and use all the external resources needed, D427 will be a breeze. I was worried about staring it with a month to go in my term, and finished in a week.\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/42li5iit8i2d1.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=997946b36c3db1f64ad38b61e7eea42b5d2b12b1  \n",
