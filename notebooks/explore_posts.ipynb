I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips & Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations & Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!</div></details></td>\n",

Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.

Why might an OS prefer preemptive scheduling?\\n\\n**A6**:\\n\\n* **Preemptive**: The OS can interrupt a running process to run another.\\n* **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts, it runs until completion or blocks.\\n* **Preference**: Preemptive scheduling improves responsiveness and fairness in multitasking.\\n\\n# Q7: Briefly describe Round-Robin scheduling vs. Shortest Job Next (SJN).\\n\\n**A7**:\\n\\n* **Round-Robin**: Each process gets a fixed time slice in a cyclic queue. Fair but can have high context switching.\\n* **SJN (Shortest Job Next)**: Chooses process with the shortest expected execution time; optimizes turnaround time but needs accurate job length estimates.\\n\\n# Q8: What is context switching, and why does it cause overhead?\\n\\n**A8**:\\n\\n* **Context switching** is saving a running process’s state and loading another’s.\\n* Causes overhead because the CPU does extra work saving/restoring registers, memory maps, etc., rather than executing user processes.\\n\\n# Q9: What are threads, and how do user-level threads differ from kernel-level threads?\\n\\n**A9**:\\n\\n* **Threads** are lightweight units of execution within a process.\\n* **User-level**: Managed in user space; fast context switches, but OS sees only one thread.\\n* **Kernel-level**: Managed by OS; more overhead but true parallelism on multicore CPUs.\\n\\n# Q10: Define multiprogramming and timesharing. How do they improve resource use?\\n\\n**A10**:\\n\\n* **Multiprogramming**: Multiple processes loaded in memory, CPU switches among them to maximize utilization.\\n* **Timesharing**: Rapid switching giving multiple users the illusion of dedicated CPU. Improves user experience via quick interactivity.\\n\\n# Q11: What tasks does a memory manager handle, and why is memory protection crucial?\\n\\n**A11**:\\n\\n* **Tasks**: Allocation/deallocation of memory spaces, tracking usage, swapping/paging.\\n* **Protection**: Prevents one process from overwriting memory of another, ensuring system stability/security.\\n\\n# Q12: How does paging work, and what is a page fault?\\n\\n**A12**:\\n\\n* **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages/frames. Process pages load into any free frame.\\n* **Page fault**: Occurs when a process tries to access a page not currently in RAM, prompting the OS to load it from disk.\\n\\n# Q13: Compare segmentation to paging in memory management.\\n\\n**A13**:\\n\\n* **Segmentation**: Memory is divided into variable-sized segments (code, data, stack).\\n* **Paging**: Uniform fixed-size blocks.\\n* Segmentation aligns with program structure; paging simplifies allocation but can lead to fragmentation.\\n\\n# Q14: Define virtual memory. What advantage does it offer?\\n\\n**A14**:\\n\\n* **Virtual memory**: Extends RAM with disk space, giving processes the illusion of large contiguous memory.\\n* **Advantage**: Allows more/larger programs to run simultaneously by swapping pages as needed.\\n\\n# Q15: What is thrashing, and how can an OS mitigate it?\\n\\n**A15**:\\n\\n* **Thrashing**: A state where the system spends excessive time swapping pages in and out of memory instead of executing.\\n* **Mitigation**: Reducing multiprogramming load (fewer processes), better page replacement algorithms, sufficient RAM.\\n\\n# Q16: What is the difference between demand paging and prepaging?\\n\\n**A16**:\\n\\n* **Demand Paging**: Loads a page only when needed.\\n* **Prepaging**: Loads some pages proactively, anticipating future requests. Reduces initial page faults but may waste memory if unneeded.\\n\\n# Q17: Why might an OS keep file system management separate from process management?\\n\\n**A17**:\\n\\n* **Modular design**: Each component (filesystem vs. process manager) can be developed, maintained, and debugged independently.

I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write…</summary><div>Hello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click > new > Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n>Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: <version>3.3.6</version>\\nLombok: <version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\\n<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>\\n<version>3.3.6</version>\\n```\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>\\n<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>\\n<version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n>MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n>When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet<>();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below. Other Reddit users and I will try and get to them and answer them accordingly. If a significant update/revision should be made to the guide, please leave a comment suggesting a change. I'll try and keep this guide relevant for at least a little while, but with the new degree plan coming, it will inevitably become superannuated.  \\n\\nIf you followed this guide and passed, **CONGRATS!** This is probably the most technical project I've done so far in my degree, and I had a lot of fun with it. So, I hope this guide made the class enjoyable for you too! Wishing you well in your future studies! 📚🎉</div></details></td>\n",

I finished yesterday 1/7/2025 after taking the OA for Audit and getting Task 2 graded for Business Simulation.\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** Not everyone can accelerate, some people don't have the time to do it, some people don't have the drive to do it. Everyone with the time and drive to do it can accelerate to a DEGREE, but your results may vary. I don't know what your previous knowledge is, how good you are at taking multi-choice tests, how much information you retain on a single or a couple of pass-throughs, etc. However, I do think that even people missing most of the skills necessary to accelerate quickly can benefit from putting in hardwork and time to accelerate their degree even if by a few terms which represents thousands if not tens of thousands of dollars in saved costs over the course of your degree. I finally want to say that doing this in 3 months was not easy. I had a great reason WHY I had to do this, which is I need to pivot careers quickly and cannot afford not to accelerate. I need to be in a stable career ASAP because my wife and I want to have children, so I had a good reason to push myself. Even with how much I pushed myself I could've done this faster, easily I could have finished this in 2.5 months or less just by not letting myself get discouraged and letting up at a few points. That being said I went into this degree expecting it to take up to a year, but I decided to push myself and get it done faster which I am proud of ultimately.\\n\\n**My circumstances:** 34 years old, married, no kids, somewhat financially secure (own a home, real estate agent, have rental income, although I am going into credit card debt to not work so that is stressful). T**his is a key detail** I did NOT work during this 3 month period.\\n\\nI am making a career change from real estate to accounting. I have limited college experience from back when I was 18-21 going on an off and dropping out multiple times. At that time I was attempting to get an associates of arts degree and wanted to be an English major. I only transferred in 4 classes from that degree which were (English Comp 1, 2, History, and Critical Thinking & Logic).\\n\\nI have a little bit of AR/AP experience from a decade ago when I worked as an inventory manager & purchasing agent for a small copier distributor. I got a lot of exposure to different aspects of business at this job from inventory intake, purchasing, inventory counts, matching documents for accounting, etc. This job actually made a lot of concepts in this degree more familiar to me than I expected it would, but the accounting classes as a whole I had to learn from the bottom up, I understood what a credit/debit was and knew what an allowance account was but that was pretty much the extent of my knowledge.\\n\\n**Time Commitment:**  Over the entire 3 months I probably averaged 8 hours a day 6 days a week, most weeks I studied 7 days but we did have a few days off here and there for holidays, trips, etc so cumulatively I'd say I studied 6 days per week across the 3 months. I didn't track my hours very well, but I pretty much woke up got on WGU and started studying, only stopped to walk dogs, eat, spend a few hours here and there watching a show/movie with the wife, and playing World of Warcraft during raid hours (very limited gaming outside of that). I attended a memorial service for 2 days during the course of the degree, did a few holiday things, and attended a couple of house gatherings with friends.\\n\\nThat being said as I went along I lost focus, especially as I hit Intermediate Accounting 1,2,3. I started spending more of my hours that should have been studying doom scrolling Facebook, Youtube & Reddit. Which brings me to my tips.\\n\\n**Tips & Suggestions: If you want to accelerate!**\\n\\n1. Go in planning to take a pause on most of your life, especially if you are working free time should just not even be a thought you entertain. Think of it as a short-term reprieve from life and be excited about the challenge in front of you. Live and breath school.\\n2. Don't rush it. Yes, you are accelerating, but if you set expectations like \"this class has to be done in 1 day\" then you will most likely burnout, stress over time, and end up quitting even though you are doing amazingly well. Just commit to working as much/long as you can, and going through the action plan you commit to, no matter how long that action plan takes just focus on the work in front of you not how long its taking, and here is my **recommended action plan:**\\n\\n**a)** when you begin a course, search google for the course number and/or name and find reddit posts, I try to look at 2-5 of them if they are available to see if there is conflicting recommendations, 99% of the time the recommendation will be watch the cohort videos, take good notes on them, review notes, take the PA, review what you got wrong on the PA / study weak points again, schedule/take OA.\\n\\n**b)** For all accounting classes READ the book/watch the embedded videos, take the quizzes for practice. This is especially true for all videos with the Stice brothers (they go away in the IA classes sadly). For IA classes (especially IA 2 & IA3) don't expect to understand it very well during reading, you will most likely understand it more by doing all of the practice questions that are in word documents especially for the second half of these classes. For the first OA on each IA class a large portion of it is an excel document, this excel document is almost identical to the PA test so you should study and know how to do the excel document from the PA (you can repeat the excel, take a screenshot of the image to review just before OA, etc), if you do that you can make more mistakes on the remaining MCQ's and still succeed.\\n\\nThe hardest courses in this degree will almost assuredly be the Intermediate Accounting courses, don't stress out over it and just embrace the challenge. The more you embrace it and continue to study through the struggles even when you aren't understanding it the faster it will go. I let myself get discouraged during the studying and it slowed me down a lot, I spent a lot of time distracting myself with my phone, etc and it easily made those classes take 30% longer or more as a result.\\n\\nI always recommend that you take your time on the accounting classes and understand it as best you can, accounting will be your job so its very important to know (not that the rest of the degree isn't, but some of it you will naturally forget anyway vs. accounting you need to have this information).\\n\\n**c)** Put your phone somewhere away from you while you study. I did not follow this rule always but I really wish I did. If you have any issues at all with allowing your phone to distract you and you are serious about accelerating then put your phone behind you or something, etc. I probably lost an average of 20% of my day over the three months by looking at my phone when I should've/could've been studying.\\n\\n**d)** Use CHATGPT to help you study. This is critical and I am even thinking about making a Youtube video going over how to use CHATGPT as a study guide, but you could probably find some good videos for it on Youtube already. Main ways to use CHATGPT to study:\\n\\n\\- Copy a question into ChatGPT that you don't understand the answer to, it could be for anything, but I especially did this for accounting to show me journal entries, etc. ChatGPT will give you a detailed explanation of the answer to the question and describe surrounding concepts, or in the case of say how a discount bond works it will explain why this is a discount bond and how it is amortized, what the journal entries are, etc. You can even ask a follow up question to ChatGPT if it doesn't fully explain it or ask it to explain it in a different way.\\n\\n\\- You can copy screenshots / images of questions and it will give you an answer! You can use this to copy a picture of a trial balance, etc plus the question and it will break down the answer for you and give the steps it takes to do it. This is so much faster than trying to go back through the learning content if you are doing a practice question and get completely stumped.\\n\\n**My Goals:** Long-term my goal is to get a CPA license and an MBA (accomplish this by Summer is my objective). I currently plan to return to WGU once my term is up (I have to wait to start the masters), in the meantime I am trying to do a single term at a local college to get some advanced accounting courses done that make me eligible to sit for the CPA here in Texas. If I can't get into those classes by the January 15th deadline though I will probably have to pivot and get an MSA instead because I can't afford to wait an entire traditional term and then take those courses and by the time the next term comes around I will be able to join WGU for the masters. Essentially I am taking the most expedient path toward a CPA license and a well paid job. The main objective is to get my CPA license and then ideally join a Big 4 firm as an junior auditor. I am open to other paths but that is the overall plan, I went into this degree knowing I wanted to pursue a CPA license and probably an MBA to be able to work in management in the long-run. My reasons for not trying to get an MSA is because I want to be in management and an MBA has more value there than an MSA does, a CPA license is looked on more favorably than an MSA and I have no intentions of being in education. If it becomes too difficult or time-consuming to circumvent the MSA due to CPA requirements then I will probably pursue an MSA and then just go back and get my MBA at a later date if I feel it is necessary. I won't know until around January 15th which path I end up taking as I am cutting it very close for Spring semester deadline for my local college. \\n\\n**Final Thoughts:** Keep in mind why you are doing this, don't get bogged down in your feelings that day just think \"what do I need to do right now to move the ball forward on this class?\" - keep the objective in front of you in your mind and don't worry about how long it will take, whether you can finish it, second guessing if its worth it, etc. Commit and just focus on the work, once you jump into the work whether that is watching cohort videos and writing notes, reading the book, or doing practice questions the concerns will fall away, so don't spend a lot of time thinking and just start doing!\\n\\nTo see my class thoughts/posts from Months 1/2 click the links below:\\n\\n[Month 2 Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/wguaccounting/comments/1h3kcul/month_2_accelerating_wgu_accounting_degree_results/)\\n\\n[Month 1 Results](https://www.reddit.com/r/wguaccounting/comments/1gh8bfd/first_month_at_wgu_accounting_program_results/)\\n\\nClass Thoughts for Month 3+:\\n\\n**Introduction to Sociology C273** \\- Watch the cohort videos included in the course resources, take notes on them.

Always use grammarly to check your work, I had an assignment sent back at the end of my degree because I stopped using it for the last several papers and it bit me at the end!\\n\\n**Principles of Economics D089** \\- I actually just read the book on this one which isn't what most people recommend I don't think, I enjoy economics though and I feel its somewhat related to the degree especially if you want to get into more leadership roles. Throughout the reading were links to Jacob Cliffords videos which were helpful, you could even go to his channel and watch his series on Economics and that would probably cover you pretty well. I skipped some of the videos done by other people/WGU specific videos because they were kind of boring.\\n\\n**Concepts in Marketing, Sales, and Customer Contact D077** \\- Watch the cohort videos in course resources, take notes, take PA, review notes and concepts you didn't do well on, take OA.\\n\\n**Intermediate Accounting I D103** \\- I read the entire book, did quizzes inside of it, took notes, I also always copy the questions & answers into my notes for questions I either guessed at/didn't know well, or ones I got wrong if I feel reviewing that question later will help me with retention. For OA 1 make sure to remember the PA excel spreadsheet exactly how to do it and get 100%, it will make it easier to pass OA 1. OA 1 should always be the easier OA for these IA classes because of the excel sheet, sometimes the excel is confusing but its the same on the PA as it is on the OA so get it figured out 100% before doing the OA.\\n\\n**Accounting Information Systems D217** \\- This class is a challenge because the videos do not give you enough detail but I hated the book material. Some people recommend reading the book so that might be a safer bet but what I did was watch the 3 cohort videos and took notes on them and then I got these notes:\\n\\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u6qbCG1EOfWkhEtHAHmbPeVjg9cnrbt\\_](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u6qbCG1EOfWkhEtHAHmbPeVjg9cnrbt_)\\n\\nIf you review those notes in detail / understand them you will do fine, you could also paste a concept into ChatGPT if you aren't getting a concept to have it explained in more detail. The book has a lot of fluff that isn't on the test, the second note in the drive that has highlighted information is stuff that the person who wrote the notes found was on the test.\\n\\nTake the PA, review things you didn't do well on on the PA before taking OA. The better you understand this class the easier Audit will be later as well because this is laying the conceptual groundwork for auditing. If you plan to go into auditing definitely don't feel bad taking your time in this class. The OA was annoying on this one but the material itself is quite useful.\\n\\n**Intermediate Accounting II D104** \\- First OA is relatively easy, make sure you know the excel portion well, I did the PA multiple times to figure out 99% of the excel portion but there was 1 thing I just COULD not get right on it and I gave up.\\n\\nSecond OA was much harder, I read through all of the course material which mostly just confused me but my advice now that I've done this class is read through the material and focus primarily on the concepts around when you do things, like when do you report stuff under GAAP, and try to understand what happens with a discount vs a premium, but don't sweat if you aren't understanding the math around certain things because I struggled on how to journalize entries for bonds payable and stocks and it stressed me out, don't stress though! After you finish the reading material Go to the course material and you'll find word document \"study guides\" for each segment, you can get one word w/ the answers one without, go through all those questions and practice answering them and writing out journal entries, I would do one question then check my answer and consider how I was wrong and make sure I undertand WHY I was wrong.\\n\\nSomething that helped me immensely during these and also during the quizzes inside the course material was to copy the data and put it into chatgpt and read its answer because it breaks down the steps to do and it was often more succinct than what I'd find in the course material, you can also put in a question that isn't asking for journal entries but then you could tell chatgpt afterward to journalize it by saying \"what are the journal entries for this?\" it will tell you what debit/credits to do which made everything a lot more clear for me.\\n\\nThe PA is going to be more math intensive and know your journal entries and how to do calculations, OA will still have those as well but it will have a few more conceptual questions on it that are more things like when do you report a lawsuit liability, or when something is antidilutive vs dilutive and do you report it, things like that. Definitely make sure you know the concepts around when you report things and not just how to do the math on amortization of bonds premium/discount but you also need to know those.\\n\\nFinally, this is definitely among the top 2 or 3 hardest classes in this degree, many will say it is the hardest. Give yourself grace and time to learn it, the first half of the class will make you think its gonna be a joke and that for me was demoralizing running into part 2 and realizing I'm not as smart as I thought, just don't give up you will figure it out and everyone else is struggling with this class as well so you aren't alone.\\n\\n**Intermediate Accounting III D105** \\- The same stuff I said for D104 goes for this class, OA 1 spreadsheet is probably the most confusing of the 3 to figure out but the PA will be the same as the OA so just get that down pat. For OA 2 the only \"hard\" part really is the leasing accounting which will be the first chapter of the book after first OA, I recommend you don't go too deep in it during the reading and go back to leasing and cash via the word documents that are located in the course resources next to the cohort videos. The leasing & cash ones are super useful to go question by question and answer them/practice. As usual, copying the question into ChatGPT if you get stumped will give you a detailed breakdown on how it works. The nice thing about D105 is the microsoft word docs that have questions on leasing also give explanations on the concepts before each block of questions, you will get to revisit a concept like say what is a finance lease and how do you determine it just before you do the practice questions.\\n\\nI learned the best in this class by going through those word documents, but I still probably recommend doing the reading. Honestly, you might be fine just watching cohort videos and doing word documents + chatgpt assistance to learn this class, the reading is very dense but it does get your brain thinking about these things. Definitely don't go through the reading expecting to fully understand things because I think the reading did a lot more to confuse me than it helped me grasp concepts. Ultimately it was the word documents and practice questions combined with chatgpt explanations of how to get to answers that really got me to understand these concepts.\\n\\nFor the cash side of things as far as determining operating cashflows one thing that helped me was a very simple concept that I believe was in the word document but I don't recall seeing it anywhere else is this:\\n\\nCash moves in the opposite direction of Assets, Cash moves in the same direction as Liabilities.\\n\\nIn other words if my Accounts Payable goes up from last year when calculating Operating Cashflow, so does my operating cashflow, and when Accounts Receivable goes up when calculating my Operating Cashflow my operating cashflow goes down.\\n\\nThis helps immensely for calculating cashflow for operating which is the most confusing part, just consider is this an asset moving on the balance sheet, or is this a liability. Assets the cash goes the opposite direction as it went on the balance sheet, liabilities move in the same direction.\\n\\nThis concept is for the Indirect Method for calculating the Statement of Cashflows for Operating Cashflows. Investment/Financial cashflows are always calculated the same whether using the direct or indirect method.\\n\\n**Integrated Physical Sciences C165** \\- I read through the entire book on this class, took notes and then did PA and OA. The reading material looks long but this class can be done in 10-14 hours tops even taking your time with reading. There is a more detailed post on reddit about this class and some people find the quizlets helpful, I didn't really use them just reviewed my notes. This class was fun to go through after all the stressful classes.\\n\\n**Compensation & Benefits C236** \\- Watch all of the cohort videos, take notes. This class has a lot of concepts from other classes in it so it shouldn't be too difficult, but there are some concepts that are new. It  really pays to know the difference in detail about a Job Evaluation and a Job Analysis. Definitely review the PA in detail for mistakes you make. Some concepts I didn't see in any of the videos but ended up on the test like \"Competency-based Pay\" if you see that on the test its probably the answer lol.\\n\\nFor the PA it is quite easy, there is a video that breaks down how to write it in step-by-step detail you can probably have it done in 1-2 hours.\\n\\n**Managing in a Global Business Environment D080** \\- Watch all of the cohort videos, take notes. This entire class is about globalization and the benefits/drawbacks of business operating in a global economy. You will be expected to know different international agreements like NAFTA or Paris Accord/Kyoto Protocol, etc. which is kind of obnoxious so don't just brush over the names and details about those things. A lot of questions on the WTO, IMF, Cage Analysis has a question, and just a ton of questions about opportunities/cost of going global as a business which is the brunt of the OA.\\n\\n**Business Simulation D361** \\- There is a great detailed reddit post on how to score well on the business sim. Long story short though is focus maximum dollars into advertising for the first 3 quarters, focus on the speed/mountain bikes as your primary seller, add a few salespeople to the store but not TOO many, and do tech upgrades early.\\n\\nThe simulation is easy enough to get a \"passing\" grade on if you just go through it so don't stress too much about it, and have some fun with it. The papers are pretty easy to write, just don't forget to use grammarly!\\n\\n**Auditing D215** \\- The path for Audit that is most time efficient is to watch the 45 Edspira videos on Audit, then download the word documents from course chatter which include all of the questions/answers from the books quizzes to read through, a word document of the concepts not included in Edspira videos, and additional questions you can answer as practice. I would then copy the concepts that aren't super detailed from the word document that explains concepts not in Edspira videos and it gives you 1-2 pages of details around the concept. Take the PA, review all questions that were confusing to you or you got wrong and use ChatGPT to flesh out concepts more so you understand them. The book will easily make this class take 4x longer, I was able to do Audit in under 2 days with this method, if I read through the entire book I expect it would've taken me 8+ days. Finally, keep in mind the OA on Audit will have a lot of scenario based questions and conceptual questions not a lot of definitions. If after doing everything above you still don't feel confident then maybe reading through the material can be helpful but I personally don't think its necessary.\\n\\n[Edspira Audit Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_KGEFWqEaTAZGeyoPaDzBXBYhv1tnTeJ)</div></details></td>\n",

This is only to let people know how “I” did it.  Please don’t take this as a “be all end all”. I take no responsibility  for your progress, and everyone has to put in their work. I would love  to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any  kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it. You can  do it, but remember that everyone is different.\\n\\nI  will however, link you to a blank APA template I used for all my  papers. It is formatted with headers and everything, with a brief  explanation of the sections. I used this template for all my papers.

If  you are planning to start soon and wanna break my record, Go for it!  Also, if you are already started, but wanna try to accelerate, hopefully  a little from this write-up can help you too! The goal is to finish,  even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast!  I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however,  anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I  personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before  I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back  a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use  this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes  relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore  we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s  coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will  suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting  your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*,  that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est  this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est  re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not  pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*.  If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of  thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass  before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*,  and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2  days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est  thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then  add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try. Go here:  [**https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl**](https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl)\\n\\nC204 – Management Communication – **Very Easy Class. 1 Paper, 1 PowerPoint Presentation and Video + 1 Executive Summary**.  This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job  well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qc5bhx6kre051.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18e976844dd1590b122f3580644ec34cbf84c5d8)</div></details></td>\n",

Took me just 12 days. This writeup focuses on the 6 more classes needed for the MSML, as I had already completed the MBA degree prior.\\n\\nI once again completed a class at a rate of one a day, with a downtime (waiting period) for grading of my papers about every other day. All OA’s were passed on the day I took them. Please ignore the terms and some of the dates are messed up. I spoke to Student Services, and they assured me that all of it will be fixed for my transcript. If you notice, I did take and pass the teamwork class C205 Leading Teams earlier in my term, as my mentor wanted me to do that class first, so I count that in for a few days as well.\\n\\nI also procrastinated like hell until the last few days of my term. I know I am fast, so I just waited for the last 2 weeks of my term and then did most of my classes.\\n\\nPLEASE DON'T DO WHAT I DID! I am a very fast writer, so I had no problem doing this. I could afford to wait till close to the end of my term. For those who need time to complete classes, please start immediately as soon as your term begins!\\n\\nNow again, I have my own incentive to do this. I know not everyone can do it, but I know my capabilities, and I knew it wouldn’t be hard for me. For others, it may take more effort, and...\\n\\nTHAT’S OK!\\n\\nAs long as you finish. You do not have to accelerate. Just finish.\\n\\nNow remember, no rubric requests! I wont reply to any requests for rubric materials or study guides, etc. You gotta wait till you start your program to see it on your own. I feel like rubric sharing is wrong and honestly not fair to others, so I won’t do it. I had to wait to start my program to see the rubric, so you gotta wait, just like everyone else. I won't be giving anyone a chance to get a head start on any class or papers.\\n\\nSorry.\\n\\nAbout the MSML Degree and the main WGU Subreddit (My Perspective Only!)\\n\\nThis degree (these last 6 classes, including the capstone) was a cakewalk compared to the MBA. The classes are all common sense related, with some theory here and there that you have to know to answer the questions on the OA correctly.\\n\\nOh, by the way, the MSML degree (that is, the remaining 6 classes) only has two classes that has an OA. The rest are papers. (PA’s)\\n\\nBefore I do the class breakdown, please remember, to each their own. I post this just to help out someone out there who would like a little info about the MSML degree.\\n\\nThere’s not a lot of info out there on these remaining MSML classes, so I thought it was time for another write-up.\\n\\nNow as far as the main WGU subreddit, or all those who are upset at what I did, or how I did it, I will say this: I don't care. If you don’t like the info I posted, please, move on. If you dislike what I did, and are jealous, well, too freaking bad. I love WGU, and I fully intend to use the school for MY purposes.\\n\\nSo…Deal with it.\\n\\nI did my MBA in 19 days, and my MSML in 12 days. Call me whatever you want, cheater, liar, etc. I have heard it all before.\\n\\nI no longer participate or contribute on the main r/WGU subreddit, as it has grown toxic, and the mods are silly, power-tripping, jealous children, who derive pleasure from censorship.\\n\\nThey actually hate seeing people post stories of success. And they don’t want people coming to ask questions about WGU, or how it compares to similarly structured programs. The hell? Who does this? I would NEVER censor anyone in my subreddit. Regardless if I disagree with them or not. It’s called being an adult and having differing opinions. I DO NOT agree with this, so I will NEVER, EVER contribute there ever again. If I could, I would tell everyone to leave that toxic, censored garbage place of a subreddit and seek other subreddits.\\n\\nI personally feel like too many mentors (who work for WGU) frequent there too often. In addition, there are also other nefarious people who shouldn’t be there, that only come there to troll, mislead and hate on others, and that, along with the garbage, self-entitled mods who run that place, I think people should consider alternative subs. (Like this one).\\n\\nThat’s just my opinion.\\n\\nBy the way, join my subreddits: WGU\\_MBA, WGU\\_Business, and WGU\\_Nursing. I created them especially for people looking for a better place than the WGu subreddit. Where freedom of speech is given to all. No censorship to anyone. (As long as you arent racist or some crazy thing like that.)\\n\\nAlso, WGUeducation is an ok one too.\\n\\nNow, for those who would like relevant info, and desire to know more, please read on.\\n\\nMSML Class Breakdown\\n\\nRemember, this is just info on the six remaining classes for the MSML if you already have the MBA.\\n\\nIf you haven’t done the MBA, you can read my full MBA Megathread here:\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\nC201 – Business Acumen (1 Objective Assessment/Test)\\n\\nThis is a fairly easy and simple class. One test. One and done. It's multiple-choice of course, as with all OA’s. It tests common-sense business stuff. The OA highly resembles the Pre-Assessment. I’m gonna be straightforward and honest. Use Quizlet, take the pre-assessment, and then once you pass, study the pre-assessment for the right answers, then go back to Quizlet, and study a few more “trusted” quiz sets, and then schedule the bloody thing and take it the same day. I passed this class in 2 hours of studying, including taking the pre-assessment. Ignore people who discourage Quizlet. A lot of people post excellent study sets that come in very useful. Of course, if you come across a question that is questionable, research the answer yourself, but don’t let people tell you that Quizlet is bad. It isn’t.\\n\\nNow coming back to the class, as I said, this class is not hard at all. Basic memorization/cramming is enough to pass. No trick questions, no roundabout or funny responses. The only thing I dislike for the test, is that about 10-15% of the questions will be select all that apply or select more than one answer, which I dislike, but since the test content is easy enough to understand, it was no biggie. At one point, since I only studied for just about 2 hours, I felt that I might not do too well, since I wasn’t sure I had the right answers, but when I finished and submitted, sure enough, I passed. This class is an easy pass, and you can answer the questions mostly from common sense and your gut feeling of the best answer. However, I do admonish you to do quizlets and get the general sense and idea of how to answer the questions. Just do quizlets and study the pre-assessment to get the right type of “thinking” along the vein of the questions they will ask.\\n\\nC203 – Becoming an Effective Leader (2 Papers/PA’s, and 3 surveys. A fourth, if you never did the MBA before.)\\n\\nAll papers class, with some bullshit personality surveys. Nonsense. Those things can never measure your true self. It’s all nonsense. But, it’s what is required, so you gotta do them. The surveys are “personality” trait surveys. You know the kind. Answers like: Sometimes, all the time, maybe, neutral, agree, disagree, blah, blah. I bullshitted them. I was in a funny and silly mood, so I literally entered “neutral” for ALL of my responses, and I did this for ALL three of the surveys. It was funny. You don’t have to do that, but I did. As a matter of fact, if you’re not a strong writer, then DON’T do that. Fill them out properly, because my results came back as “he is strong in A, but weak in A”. Lol! :.)\\n\\nFor the tasks, you write the first paper based on the surveys. For me, I am a strong writer, so I could even make sense out of a “neutral” response for everything. (I even got an excellence award for one of my task submissions.) For others, you may need to have a strong area and a weak area to contrast your points for your paper. Whatever you do, it's just the two paper tasks.\\n\\nThe first task makes you write about the surveys you took, and a chosen leadership style of your choice from the included list of choices they give. The second task asks you to write about a specific “type” of leadership, of which they will give you the topic. Easy peasy, and of course, follow your rubric.\\n\\nC205 – Leading Teams (A single one-page form, a group/team task but super easy, and 2 other personal papers)\\n\\nThis is the only teamwork class you will ever have in this program. The class has what WGU calls a “cohort” that starts at the beginning of every month. Depending on when you start the class, you may miss the cohort for the beginning of the month, and you will have to wait until the 1st of the next month, so plan accordingly. The “cohort” just means group or team assignment. As mentioned, this is the only class with a group assignment. The class is broken up into people who live in your time-zone, groups of about 4-5 people, and you have to essentially work together and fill out a one page form, and then create a PowerPoint presentation. You divide up the work between your team members. The one-page form is just a team charter, and they just want the team members to conference over the phone, and fill it out. Takes like 10 mins. Members can communicate however they want. Our group did a group text message. They give you like 6 weeks to finish the silly PowerPoint, but I convinced my team to do it in a few days, and we did it in under a week. It was super easy. They let you name your team whatever you want. We literally named ourselves, “Fast Completion Team” and we did just that. Have fun with it. They give you the rubric, and you just divide up the parts and each person writes their own part and then you can have someone who is good at PowerPoint just put it all together, and done. Submit and your team passed.\\n\\nThe other two papers are written by yourself, and you can submit once done. Easy-peasy.\\n\\nSo please, DO NOT DREAD OR FEAR THE TEAM WORK!!! It is far too easy. They tell you EXACTLY what to write. You literally just write it and you copy and paste it into the slides. PowerPoint itself has designs that will format it and make it look nice with bullet points and everything. No hard work needed. If you have someone who is dragging their foot and being lazy in your group, just do their freaking part and submit the darn thing. Don’t bother complaining or getting a mentor or instructor involved. It’s really not worth your time. Just forget that member and submit. The lazy member, (if you get stuck with one) still has to write their other two papers. If they are lazy, they will remain so, but don’t let them slow YOU down. This class should not take more than a week of your time. No matter what anyone says. Everyone in my group, including myself worked full-time, and we did it with ease in less than a week. Its literally just a PowerPoint presentation. There’s no limit to the number of slides, but just write what you need and THAT’S IT. Knock it out and be done with it. Submit, and move on to the other two papers you gotta write. Just follow the rubric. They also don’t grade the tasks for this class hard either.\\n\\nC208 – Change Management and Innovation (1 paper + 1 PowerPoint submitted together, and an OA/test)\\n\\nFairly easy class. They want you to write up a report on a company of your choosing. Best if you can write about where you work, and they just ask you to change the names. Meh. I made up a company. It was easier for me than to write about my horrible job with my sucky ass manager. Do whatever works for you. If you make up a company, make sure you have ALL the details you need, and that it makes sense. The evaluators don’t care, and they can’t tell anyway. Just make it sound legit, and answer the rubric and write what they ask for. If you have a real place to write up the report, then cool. Do that if you can. If not, don’t sweat it. Just make up a company. Don’t bother looking for somewhere if it’s not conducive or convenient for you. Write according to the rubric. Nothing else. Do that and submit. Done.\\n\\nThen do a PowerPoint with the info as they ask for it, which is super easy. Just copy the info from the paper, and make it look pretty, and submit it together. Done.\\n\\nThen go study up for the OA. I did some more quizlet sets, and I just made sure I understood what and why the answers were the way they were. Same common sense BS. It’s a combination of business, entrepreneur questions, some change management common sense questions, etc. All easy stuff. As I said, don’t sweat it. Just prepare properly and you will pass. My go to prep of choice is of course, quizlet, and always will be! It’s all there, and its free. Take advantage of it. Forget reading the course. I NEVER EVER read the course materials. EVER.\\n\\nC209 – Strategic Management (2 Papers/Tasks)\\n\\nThis class is just two papers on strategy for management and running your business. However, this is the second to last class, and they do grade the tasks hard for this one. They ask you to come up with a strategy for your chosen business (use the same one you wrote about from C208) and how to implement that strategy. As this is the second to last class of the degree, they grade this class harder than the previous classes. I am a very good writer, and I never, ever get my papers returned, but the evaluators for this class returned my papers twice, literally asking for the same EXACT thing. They were doing it to make me frustrated. From talking to some friends of mine who I know also attend WGU, I find that they do that sometimes to give some students a hard time. However, NEVER get frustrated. No matter what. ALWAYS revise and write EXACTLY what they ask for, even if it is 3 or 5 times, and resubmit. To stick it in their faces, I resubmit my papers in less than 20 mins when they return it for revision. It pisses them off! Or at least I hope it does. Lol! Of course, you have to be lucky to be home at the same time the evaluation comes back, and be ready to re-write the parts and submit it right away. Sometimes it’s not possible. If you can’t, then don’t stress. Just resubmit whenever you can.\\n\\nOnly advice here for this class is to FOLLOW THE RUBRIC TO THE LETTER! No shortcuts here, friends. Not for this class. They will try to find even a single sentence you missed out, and return your paper for it. They do it to make the class a little harder. Think Data Driven Management from the MBA, but nothing to do with data or statistics of course, just that they try to grade your papers somewhat harshly. They just try to make the class hard since it's your second to last class and you are almost done. They also know what I came to find out in the last class below…\\n\\nC210 -MSML Capstone (3 tasks: 1 annotated bibliography, 1 semi-major paper, and 1 video PowerPoint presentation)\\n\\nThey know that this class is a damn CAKEWALK. The capstone is SUPER EASY. It wasn’t hard at all. I literally did it in 2 days. Yes, 2 freaking days. Even if you are a slow writer, you can knock this class out in short order. There is however a catch, and I will explain in a bit.\\n\\nThe first task asks you to create an annotated bibliography. They want you to compile some APA sources from ALL of the classes you took in the program that is a part of the MSML degree, which should be 9 classes to pull sources from. They say you can do between 2-5 sources per class. But lol, who does 5 sources? No one. Do the BARE minimum. I did 2 sources per class. NEVER do more than you don’t have to. EVER.\\n\\nThey give you the template for the annotated bibliography. Just copy and paste your sources and write what they ask you to. Submit and done. Don’t forget the references page, which should list all the sources you wrote on. Should be 18 sources in all. Easy-peasy. Done.\\n\\nNext, you write a semi-large paper, and again, just follow the forsaken rubric. It will ask you a lot of info from C208 and C209. The capstone essentially builds a lot on the info you wrote about in those two prior classes. Again, don’t keep writing new material if you ALREADY wrote about it. Just use it again from prior papers YOU wrote. Copy and paste the relevant info where it applies. Make it look good, BUT DO NOT PLAGIARIZE someone else. USE YOUR OWN WORK. You can’t plagiarize yourself, lol.\\n\\nDo be careful though, as depending on your evaluator, you could get a tough grader, and they may return your paper for something they may want to see. It may or may not even be in the rubric. It happened to a friend of mine. Their evaluator wanted to see something that he/she thought should be included. In that case, just add what they ask for, even if it isn’t in the rubric, and re-submit. Don’t ever waste your time fighting an evaluator with an appeal, unless it is a glaring error they made.\\n\\nFinally, once that is done, then you gotta make a PowerPoint presentation, with info along the same stuff as the paper, and then create a video explaining it. The preferred platform of choice is Panopto, but you can use whatever works for you. Again, follow thy rubric, that thy task might not be returned to thine hands for revision. The capstone was super-duper easy though. As I said, I did all three parts in 2 days.\\n\\nHOWEVER, there is the catch that I mentioned earlier. They know the capstone for the MSML is kinda easy for the most part, at least compared to the MBA, so they built in a “slow-down” mechanism. The catch is that you MUST pass task 1 before you can submit task 2. You have to wait on the evaluation to come back and say that you passed. Then you must submit and PASS task 2, before you can submit task 3. NO EXCEPTIONS. I had to wait to submit each task one at a time. It was more frustrating than you think. Especially for someone hyper-accelerating, like myself. The grading was ok, but be watchful for if you submit at the end of the month. You will wait much longer to get your papers and tasks back from evaluation. That’s the only catch. They claim that they do it that way, because they want to have you “build” off of each task.\\n\\nPersonally, I find it ridiculous. But hey, iz nah my rulez.\\n\\nOnce done, submit and pass, and you are all done. MSML degree complete.\\n\\nI’m gonna be honest. For me, this degree was a walk in the park. I know some people will say that it's hard, but if you got through the MBA, then the MSML is really like candy or icing on the cake. It's really not that difficult at all. Do it, and get that second Masters, which will look awesome on your resume, and make you much more marketable than having just one.\\n\\n(That’s my opinion of course. Don’t sue me.)\\n\\nAnd please, don’t get me wrong. I don’t want them to make the degree harder. Shoots. I love this freaking school. I hope more and more people get turned onto this amazing school. Even President Obama loves this school and what its doing for students. Don’t believe me? Google it.\\n\\nAs far as I’m concerned, easy is good. My thing is, you ALWAYS learn on the job anyway. Let’s keep knocking out these degrees and pull ourselves out of poverty and get good paying jobs.\\n\\nI hope this write-up was helpful for you, and I hope I gave some good, solid, relevant advice. I wrote this all for those who want a heads up on what the 6 classes of the MSML was about. Even if you don’t have the MBA as yet, and will just be doing the MSML, this can still be useful for you. Remember, if you are just doing the MSML, and haven’t done the MBA as yet, my MBA writeup has all the other classes you will take for the MSML, so you can get the rest of the class info there.\\n\\nSo all in all, it was worth it to do the MSML after the MBA. If you have doubts, please don’t. It is worth it to do a little more work and get a second Master’s degree. Hence, as far these things go, I say do it! You won’t regret it. These 2 Masters sure are looking nice on my wall. :.)\\n\\nWGU for the Win, again.\\n\\nAt least for me.\\n\\nI hope it will be the same for you!</div></details></td>\n",

Quite frankly, it's the only reason I still use reddit.\\n\\nNow I'd like to give back.\\n\\nBelow are the exact steps I took from beginning to end in Mobile App Development using C#.\\n\\nThis is the last course I had prior to my capstone. Between Software 1, Software 2, and TONS of supplementary DSA Work (mostly neetcode pro's beginner course), I felt very confident in my ability to write c# and design my application. I'm very comfortable with C# (and have prior projects to look back on if I need some ideas/inspiration). Anyway, all of this to say, I did not interact with the course material prior to starting my Project. You may feel the need to, and that is ok! but I cannot help you there as I did not interact with the course material.\\n\\n**Preparation**\\n\\na. create personal outline of Task 2:\\n\\n* For me, this means going through the task with a fine-tooth comb and writing down exactly what I need.\\n* I highly recommend writing it out yourself.

All I know is that once I installed android studio, the android emulator in visual studio started working, and before it crashed.\\n   * One other thing, if you play league of legends or valorant (kekw), disable your Vanguard for this. It can mess with the emulator.\\n      * Also, I'm sorry you play league (I have 10k+ hours on that game).\\n\\nd. Preliminary email:\\n\\n* Whoever your CI is (shoutout Harlan and Lauren), email them and ask if you can use the MVVM toolkit. There should be no issue with it, but in the event you submit your project and it gets returned by  an evaluator because you used mvvm toolkit, written permission from your ci is your ticket to freedom. MVVM toolkit is not necessary in the slightest, but it is worth emailing them NOW instead of later if you plan to use it.\\n* to clarify, I have yet to see someone get told that they are not allowed to use the toolkit. I have seen plenty of anecdotes claiming their project was returned for using it and they later got approval to use it.\\n\\ne. OPTIONAL learning:\\n\\n* If you'd like to, you can choose to go through James's course in its entirety right now:\\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY)\\n   * [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY)\\n   * OR, skip ahead in this writeup to the coding droplets videos, watch those.\\n   * I personally chose not to. There are a couple reasons for this:\\n      * I got to double up my figma time (making my wireframe) with watching some about-X videos on .net maui, mvvm, etc.\\n      * When you finish this course, you will WANT to code asap. Keep that momentum!\\n      * If you have any questions/concerns on your wireframe, and you finish it after watching the course, you are at the mercy of how busy your CI is.\\n\\n**Part A: Gitlab**\\n\\na. Quite literally, follow the word document provided. See b. for any problems that may arise.\\n\\nb. Problems FAQ (all the problems I encountered, atleast)\\n\\n* Q: what if I cannot see the student repos?\\n   * A: Follow the steps to create your own repo, and then give it a few minutes. I had to wait a smidge and then refresh the tab but eventually it showed up.\\n* Q: What if I cannot clone the repo to my visual studio?\\n   * A: Make sure you are using visual studio 2022, and that it is up to date.\\n   * [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37813568/git-remote-repository-not-found](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37813568/git-remote-repository-not-found) follow Mukesh Salaria's response (it worked for me)\\n      * other answers on this thread may be of use\\n* Q: I took version control so long ago!

You cannot add or push with vs2022 open.\\n   * A2: If you closed it and there are still problems, email your CI.\\n\\nc. I did a test commit here to ensure I was doing everything correctly.\\n\\n**Part B. Wireframe**\\n\\n* General Recommendations/notes:\\n   * Get your emulator functioning in vs2022 prior to starting this. That way, if you need to troubleshoot or wait on an email reply, you can work on your wireframe while you wait.\\n      * if you have serious issues getting it working, you are not alone, see my solution below\\n   * Use the wgu mobile app and a browser page for some inspiration regarding layout and organization.   -For my wireframe, I used figma.\\n      * The medium you use to create the wireframe isnt too important.\\n   * While designing your wireframe, I highly recommend making the 'plain view' of each app section, then copy/pasting that 'plain view' as many times as necessary\\n      * then add app functionality demonstrations to said copies. This will save you a ton of time.\\n   * Any time the rubric mentions \"Addition, Editing, Deletion, and Storage of...\", what they mean is your wireframe must   explicitly show that users can add/edit/delete/store those things.\\n      * More superficially, for the picker, use a specific design style to make it stand out.\\n      * Use a bell for notifications,\\n      * use underlined, blue colored text for 'links',\\n      * use a calendar image for date pickers,\\n      * etc.\\n   * Lastly, the specific functional details must also be demonstrated with the wireframe\\n      * e.g. show what the \"remove term\", \"Add term\", datePickers, etc. all look like in action (draw out the box itself), and add arrows from the UI element to the box/picker.\\n* Add Your Terms:\\n   * The evaluators are looking for something that shows the ability to navigate between all X terms.\\n      * I personally put in 6 terms, but displayed it using one term, and had it highlighted with a \"currently viewing\" label as well.\\n   * start times can be what you like, just remember a term at wgu is 6 months :)\\n* Add 6 courses per term:\\n   * This one confused me at first. I had to email a CI for clarity.\\n   * We are fine to just show 6 courses in a given term (we do not have to display 6 courses for EACH term we added in part 1)\\n   * The \"detailed view of each course\" and \"editing of detailed course view screen\" just means they want the explicit details/examples.\\n   * We still must explicitly show details as I said above. In this section, that means demonstrate the functionality of:\\n      * date picker for start/end times,\\n      * picker for course status,\\n      * add/sharing/displaying notes\\n      * setting notifications\\n* Add Two assessments for each course.\\n   * This section is just adding the OA/PA sections and notification functionality.\\n* Other notes:\\n   * I made a folder for \"part B\" and then made \"part 1\", \"part 2\", and \"part 3\" folders, placing screenshots of my figma wireframes in each as necessary.\\n   * I would add all for a part, push it to my gitlab with a commit message \"added part x\", and then move on to the next part.\\n   * You can always go back and update when feedback comes through, but creating a easy to follow trail of initial commits will make it much easier for the evaluators to see.\\n\\n**C. App Creation**\\n\\nSince I took on the role of guinea pig for this writeup, I tried a lot of different things. Below I will share what I specifically did, followed but what I recommend doing instead:\\n\\n* I watched james' 4 hour guide, got super confused at the 2 hour mark, and pivoted to his 8part \"beginner\" .net maui series:\\n* [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUBAdL2NwBpDs32zwGqb9DY)\\n* Specifically, 3, 4, and 5 were very helpful.\\n* I then got confused AGAIN and stumbled upon these two videos from coding droplets:\\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VziMUc-VQko&t=493s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VziMUc-VQko&t=493s) (starting your project and adding sqlite integration)\\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G\\\\\\_vktKfMU20&t=125s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_vktKfMU20&t=125s) (page navigation)\\n* From there, it was small bits and pieces of googling or asking chat gpt for help, but quite frankly EVERYTHING you need (with exception to whatever xaml style you want to add) is in the two coding droplets videos.\\n* ***If I had to do it again, I would start with the coding droplets videos, and follow along to grasp the content, then start my project.***\\n* I  also recommend ensuring you can get the emulator working ASAP and troubleshooting if need be.\\n* Side Notes:\\n   * Many folks on this sub shared success with James' 4 hour course, and that is great. Personally, all the extra stuff with mvvm toolkit and boiler plate code generation is beyond me. I did what was necessary for the class, and now I write this focusing on my capstone and am diving in to all things ASP.NET. Baby steps, people.\\n   * If you want to work with .net maui or further your understanding, then I highly recommend watching Coding Droplets videos to get the basics,  then pivoting to James' full 8 part course playlist, THEN his 4 hour beginner guide.\\n   * Again, This app is not hard to make, and does not require the MVVM toolkit nor the extra page navigations that James refers to. There maybe half as much work in this project as software 2 for c#. Software I took me 40ish hours of coding, Software II took me about 80ish hours of coding.\\n   * This project took me somewhere in the realm of 40 hours, but half of that was getting the emulator to work, finding the right nuget packages, or emailing my CI/professor about the issues I was having (and how there was no documented fixes for them yet).\\n\\nNow for all the specifics of section C. I do not want to give answers away, so I will share what I did and what resources that helped me along the way, but no code :)\\n\\n* Any Button placed near the bottom of the app screen when you load the app WILL NOT FIRE. Design accordingly.\\n* Stackoverflow, Google, and ChatGPT are your friends.\\n* For XAML formatting, I relied heavily on horizontal and vertical stack layouts. If you want 3 buttons side-by-side, use a horizontal layout. If you want a list of items formatted the same way, use a vertical stack layout.\\n* DONT FORGET TO PUSH TO GITLAB WITH EVERY SECTION YOU FINISH :)\\n* Dont forget to add builder services for every new content page you add. I lost a lot of time on this, more than I'd like to admit.\\n\\n**C1**\\n\\n* The first coding droplets video will give you everything you need here. You will have to reformat a few things\\n* I recommend using different terms for your project of course. I drew on my experiences with Software 1 + 2 here.\\n\\n**C2**\\n\\n* This one was tricky, but everything you need is in the first or second coding droplets videos.\\n* You will need to figure out how you want to organize the relationship between terms and courses both in the app and within your classes/code, not to mention how you want to display them to the viewer.\\n* I pulled a lot from my experience desiging classes for Software 1 and Software 2. Think Big picture. What objects do you NEED to pass in, what is the flow of your program? etc.\\n* I got held up for awhile on preventing the user from adding more than 6 courses per term. Pay attention to how coding droplets handles async functions, especially when a new page is initialized.\\n\\n**C3**\\n\\n* I got held up on this one due to page refreshing. I would add a course to a term, but that new course would not show up until I went back and loaded the term page again.\\n* I fixed it with this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctLORcVaVB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctLORcVaVB4)\\n* I ran into more problems trying to implement the update function. Took me 2 hours to figure out that I was missing the primary key in my method call to update a course. Do not be like me, use primary keys.\\n* For delete functionality, I didn't do any sort of convoluted cascade deletion. I just deleted the term and it took care of any corresponding courses.\\n   * For courses, I also just deleted them :)\\n\\n**C4/C5**\\n\\n* Most of these sections are about adding components to existing functionality (with the exception to sharing and notifcations). For me it was, atleast. I added to what I used to add terms in order to input the rest of the OA data into my tables / display.\\n* This was the only piece in my github repo that I pushed together (made note of it in my commit message). You won't get docked for pushing 2 of them together, but you will for not noting WHERE you pushed it to the git repo.\\n* **VERY IMPORTANT**: THE NEWEST VERSION OF PLUGIN.LOCALNOTIFICATIONS WILL NOT COMPILE AND WILL FAIL BUILDS EVERY TIME. TO FIX THIS, ROLL BACK TO VERSION 11.1.0\\n* For notifications, watch this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWdXXGa1\\\\\\_hI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWdXXGa1_hI)\\n* For sharing,I just used this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/data/share?view=net-maui-8.0&tabs=android\\n   * The explanation in the submission rubric is confusing because they make it sound like you have to get another nuget package but YOU LITERALLY DONT.\\n\\n**C6**\\n\\n* Very straightforward part. No explanation needed here, just remember to clear your existing db first.\\n\\n**D1**\\n\\n* This part took me a couple hours, because I dreamed REALLY BIG on my wireframe. Nothing wrong with that, but I needed to provide more explanation.\\n* This is a good time to re-evaluate your wireframe and make any small changes necessary to match the requirements.\\n* Doing this saved me 1-2 revisions because I caught a couple of mistakes.\\n* I personally compiled a word doc and pasted all of my screenshots of my wireframe (I made mine with figma, and used windows+shift+S to grab pictures of each required component of the wireframe) into said doc, adding notes underneath each.\\n\\n**D2**\\n\\n* This part was so easy it almost need not exist. It's effectively a written signature from you (the developer) that any differences between your project and your submitted wireframe are acknowledged and accounted for.\\n\\n**E**\\n\\n* You are not submitting a zip folder for your task. All you are doing is submitting 2 gitlab links. I made the mistake of trying to zip my whole project folder and submit it (it was too big lol), make changes to resize it, then resubmitted said zip folder, all for it to be returned anyway.\\n* Do not be like me, follow instructions the first time. I only had my submission returned because of this failure on my end. Passed my next submission after I learned to submit links instead of a giant folder :)\\n   * 1 link is to your git repo\\n   * The other is to your git repo history page\\n\\nAND YOU'RE DONE!\\n\\nPlease leave any other feedback I missed. This was a fun project, but it was clouded with lack of information. Hope this helps! God bless <3</div></details></td>\n",
