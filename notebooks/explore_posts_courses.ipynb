I have a lot I've forgotten since I got my degree and will essentially be starting from zero, but I know I can catch onto things fairly quickly. Or at least I hope! I know it will be tough, require self discipline and sacrifices, but do you all have any resources I should definitely look into prior to getting started? I thank you all in advance!   \n",

Do yall think this is doable in 6 months, or at least knock out most of it out before the semester ends? I know this topic is subjective and all depends on me, but i would really like to know if the rest of these courses would give me a hard time or slow me down. To put into perspective, I hated C777 and failed the first time and I feel like D427 is going to be the same way.    \n",

I'll say SMALLINT, but it wants SMALLINT UNSIGNED or I put SMALLINT and it wants INT UNSIGNED,  etc. I don't know why I'm struggling so much with this, but it made me wonder if the OA will mark the whole question wrong for a mistake like that or if it will grant partial credit.
