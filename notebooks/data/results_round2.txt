Alright — let’s process this step by step.
Below is the manual labeling for is_pain_point based on each post’s title + selftext and your instructions (✅ = YES = pain point, ❌ = NO):

✅ Pain-point density

sentiment_band	pain-points	total_posts	%
<= -0.5	2	5	40%
-0.5 to -0.3	2	5	40%
-0.3 to -0.2	0	5	0%
-0.2 to -0.1	4	5	80%
-0.1 to 0.0	1	5	20%
> 0.0	0	5	0%


⸻

✅ Recommendation

The data shows -0.2 to -0.1 has the highest pain-point density (80%), supporting that -0.2 is a good cut. The adjacent band -0.3 to -0.2 shows 0%, so lowering the cut would add noise. Keep the VADER cut at -0.2 — raising it would risk losing clear pain points.
