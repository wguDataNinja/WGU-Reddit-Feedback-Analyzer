Pain-point Density by Band:

band	pain-points / posts	%
<= -0.5	2/5	40%
-0.5 to -0.3	2/5	40%
-0.3 to -0.2	2/5	40%
-0.2 to -0.1	1/5	20%
-0.1 to 0.0	0/5	0%
> 0.0	0/5	0%

Recommendation:

The bands -0.5 to -0.3, -0.3 to -0.2, and <= -0.5 each have equal pain-point density (40%),
 while the -0.2 to -0.1 band drops significantly (20%). Thus, keeping the VADER threshold
 at -0.2 is appropriate for isolating pain-point posts clearly.
