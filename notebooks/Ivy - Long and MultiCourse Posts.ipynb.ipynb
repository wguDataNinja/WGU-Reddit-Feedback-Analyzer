    "Identify and review posts that mention multiple WGU courses and/or are unusually long.  \n",
    "These posts often contain rich, diary-style details, peer study plans, or indirect signals that may not appear in short negative posts.  \n",
    "We will explore how to handle these posts in Ivy by:\n",
    "- Counting post length and number of course mentions\n",
    "- Sorting and inspecting examples\n",
    "- Evaluating whether a second AI pass should split or summarize them by course\n",
    "- Informing any changes to Ivy’s preprocessing filters and output structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings: identified threshold of 12k for long posts, with few examples (29 examples)\n",
    "Two long posts have 0 course mentions, they refer to Network+ and CompTia A+ certs, both posts are GPT-created acronyms definitions. \n",

       "      <td>Tips for Accelerating Your MBA (or Not!) - Course Tips &amp; Recommended Resources\\nLet me start by saying this. I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips &amp; Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations &amp; Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&amp;D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I finished this program today in a little over 3 months. I transferred 50 credits and work full time (Non IT). Here are my thoughts. Very long read!\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Proof of Completion](https://preview.redd.it/4372ewij6r5b1.jpg?width=1026&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b92d9611f3e8c135bf5b9ea582ef9d423b96d820)\\n\\n[Completed Progress Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/kcx3uvij6r5b1.jpg?width=1921&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=82c94084e66ec02294d3990bcebe5cc3bfd4c42a)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, there are a lot of grammatical errors in this. I know. I do not care because I’m too lazy to proof read and fix them.\\n\\nAnyways I finished this degree program in a little over 3 months (105 days to be exact) after transferring about 50 credits. I also work full time with some fairly demanding hours. I do not have any professional IT work experience, but I can navigate around a computer. I also just find the subject matter interesting. I did do the computer science program last year and graduated from that in 1 term in August of 2022. My plan was to go to grad school in Spring of 2023, but I ended up missing all my deadlines and had to wait and apply for Summer/Fall Semester of 2023. I did end up getting accepted to University of Illinois (Urbana Campus) Masters in Computer Science (Data Science Track) for Fall of 2023…which was a shocker because it’s a Top 5 school for computer science. Data science has always been my main goal, but I had all this time in between from when I applied to when the Fall semester would start. Cybersecurity was always on my list of things to learn, but I always had other priorities. Now that I had this gap of time that I could do whatever with, it was a good time for me to get into it. I originally thought about going the route of just doing certs because I already have a CS degree, but I would have just mostly done the same certs that WGU offers in their Cybersecurity program. It would have cost a little less than the actual degree, but still roughly in the same ball park if done in 1 term. Considering that I would be attaining the same certs anyways and the cost is comparable, I figure I might as well do the program and get the degree out of it as well, even though I would likely never use the degree on my resume (with exceptions) as CS “trumps” Cybersecurity. At the least, it helped me stay on track and in focus. I gotta be honest, I enjoyed it alot more than I did computer science and it really got me questioning what path I want to take in my future. I’m still going to grad school (it was a miracle that I even got excepted there), but I may defer to next year (University of Illinois allows that) as I’m thinking I want to take Cyber Security further and dive into different areas. Below is a recap of classes that may or may not help you.\\n\\nHowever, before I get into it, I would just like to point out that I have been working in the construction project management field for the last decade after I finished my first stint (of many) in college (civil engineering). Needless to say, those who are in the engineering/construction field live and die by the schedule so I have a habit of making a schedule for every significant (sometimes insignificant) things I do. I included the schedule I made for this program. I started in March and assigned myself durations to complete the entire program within 1 term and giving myself more weight to what classes I thought would be more demanding and vise-versa. This is the schedule that I would live by and you can see I was on track until I did my 4th class (Networks D325) which is when I started accelerating like crazy. The durations shown are my actuals and the grey bars you see in the gantt chart is my baseline schedule snapshot of what my original schedule was when I first made it. You can compare the 2 and see how much I blew my original schedule out of the water. Most of the classes were done much quicker than my projection. Capstone was the only one that took longer (only by 4 days). Seeing a visual of your progress helps keep you on track and is a motivating factor. I would suggest everyone put a schedule together of some sort.\\n\\n**IT Foundations – D316 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I never had a job in IT, I just grew up using a computer just like everyone else in this program. I felt alot of these questions were really basic questions and if you know your way around a computer you can probably answer most of them without heavy studying. That being said, even though it is a basic certification, I feel like I actually got alot out this course as it made me touch on things that I wouldn’t have otherwise yet is still good to know…things like differences between cpu architecture and differences in memory types, etc… stuff you don’t normally think about. I found those things to be quite interesting. The only PBQ I remember was having to simulate putting together 2 desktops, one being high performance and one being for general office use, you have to pick the right components for each desktop based on the parameters in the question. For studying I partially watched the Total Seminar Series to fill in gaps and did a few Messer practice exams. I also did practice questions from crucialexams dot com. That is one of my favorite resources. Check that site out if you do not already know about it. That was all that was needed.\\n\\n**IT Applications – D317 (17 Days…I didn’t actually spend 17 days on this course, I was inactive for 10 days)**\\n\\n\\- Part 2 of the A+ exam. I have a similar view to how I viewed “IT Foundations” (Part 1 of A+ exam). About the same difficulty as Part 1. However, alot of it seemed like it was common sense considering you didn’t just start using a computer yesterday. Many of the questions you can come up with the right answer by just logically using process of elimination. On my particular exam, it was heavy on questions regarding system tools and commands. Those were the things you are really going to want to pay attention to study for. For studying, I mainly only watched the Total Seminar Series and did some Professor Messer exams and crucial exams.\\n\\n**Legal Issues in Information Security – C841 (10 Days…had 1 revision to do)**\\n\\n\\- I didn’t read any course material. I just read what the assignment was and used outside resources to learn and fill any gaps that I had to complete the assignment. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. I had no interest in this class whatsoever and I just blew through the assignment in a few days. I could have certainly spent longer time and get in depth with the course material, but it just was not important to me and I opted to just get this class done as fast as possible. It is a very easy class if you want it to be.\\n\\n**Networks – D325 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Of all classes, this was one the most demanding for me and the most important. Networking is the foundation to everything in this program and it would behoove you take as much time needed to understand the concepts. I would encourage all of you to build some sort of homelab which can be done dirt cheap. Exam wise, it was difficult because of all the acronyms you need to remember which makes it unnecessarily difficult, but the questions themselves were not tricky and fairly straightforward except the PBQs which are nonsensical in how they are asked. In my PBQs I was asked to set up/configure a network and WIFI and was also asked to troubleshoot a network. The questions were pretty comprehensive across the board and there were a few questions on port numbers, OSI model questions (know what layer does what and what types of programs or hardware pertains to each layer), network topography, wireless standards and a bunch of questions on various plans/policies and a bunch of questions on command line utilities (learn these!). I also had maybe 3 questions on CIDR notation, but I did not have to compute anything. Again, know your acronyms! For this test, I watched the total seminar series, practice exams on crucial exams, a couple of Dion practice exams (only partially) and referenced Mike Meyers’ CompTIA Network+ Certification Passport Book. I really liked this book. His “all in one” book goes more in depth (I have it but didn’t read it much), but the Certification Passport book was much better to look up a topic and briefly read about it when going over things you need to go over. Watching the video series and then using this book as a backup was all I really needed. I did a few quick reviews on crucial exams to build some confidence.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity – C844 (3 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read any course material, I just went straight to the assignment and chipped away at it all day. I thought this class was useful as it gave you an introductory on how to use Wireshark and Nmap. Wireshark is a very cool program. Lots of features to analyze traffic. I did not read the course material for this class as the Nmap portion was easy to figure out without having to really look anything up, but for the Wireshark portion, I only watched the Udemy course: “Getting Started with Wireshark: The Ultimate Hands-On Course” by David Bombal. Excellent course and will provide you with all you need. This guy is very passionate about his Wireshark! I highly recommend this Udemy course and get as much as you can out of it. There are others, but this one was the best one that I was able to come across.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications – D329 (7 Days)**\\n\\n\\- This class is the class that requires the Security+. I found this exam to be fairly easy because there is a lot of overlap from Network+. Just like Network+ there is a lot of memorization of acronyms needed. I apologize as I don’t have much to offer on this because I don’t remember the specifics of what was on it. It is just kind of one big blur. I remember it being shockingly easy compared to Network+ like if you passed Network+ you could probably take this the next day and pass it after reviewing all the common types of attacks. For studying, I just watched the Security+ course on udemy by TIA Education, Andrew Ramdayal. He was actually pretty good, straight to the point on topics with no fluff. Probably not everyone’s “cup of tea”. Also, probably could have gone a little more in depth in some areas, but I would take this over Dion Training any day. Hell, I would take anything over Dion Training. Ramdayal strictly sticks to the objectives laid out exactly the way Comptia has their test laid out. It was easy to goto each one and pick the things you need to work on. I did no practice exams. Went straight to the official exam after I finished the video series. I do remember that one of the PBQs was setting up a firewall.\\n\\n**Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity – D431 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read the course material, I just went straight to the assignment and used outside resources and Udemy to guide me. I actually found this course to be quite fun. You will have (2) PAs and an OA to do. The first PA is that you have to create an investigation plan per best practices. The 2nd PA was fun as you will need to run a program called “Autopsy”, where you have to analyze a disk image and put a story together about what crime will likely be committed based on the evidence you found when doing your forensics. As far as the OA goes, know your tools, Windows/Linux/Mac log types and folder locations, what different parts of your Windows registry does and the various Federal Laws (critical). The preassessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty and style. That was really the only study aid I used.\\n\\n**Information Systems Security – C845 (10 Days)**\\n\\nYou will need to pass your SSCP for this one. I wrote a post on this class before. However here is a brief TLDR recap from my previous post on couple of things for you to remember:\\n\\n\\- The SSCP Practice Exam Book by Nick Mitropoulous is a fairly good representation of the exam and is the only thing I used.\\n\\n\\- This was an easier version of Security+. If you passed A+, Net+ and Sec+ than this exam will be fairly easy.\\n\\n\\- questions seem to be spread out evenly across the board for the most part, with the exception that there were very few questions on “cryptography” (I had maybe 5 or 6 that I can remember), but there were seemingly a bunch of questions regarding “identity access”. They weren’t difficult, but that section definitely had the most weight. Be sure you know the concepts behind the “who I am”, “what I know”, “what I have” principles as there were a lot of questions on that.\\n\\n\\- There were no trick questions and you don’t have to worry about remembering acronyms\\n\\n\\- Don’t psych yourself out. The most obvious answers are like the correct answers. There were no trick questions.\\n\\n\\- This is very important, read the question very carefully and really think about your answer when it comes to the “best”, “worst” and “most likely/unlikely” questions. These questions have multiple right answers so they can be kind of difficult. You have to consider how you are answering that question because you will get questions like “What is the best course of action in this (insert scenario)? Choose: A, B, C or D. Lets say the answer “A” and “B” are both definitely correct in the scenario, but choice “B” might be a step that you would do in part of step described in choice “A”. So the answer would be “A”. These are not trick questions, but you really need to think how answers integrate with others to pick the best choice. These questions were probably the most “trickiest”, but if you know to look out for them and think logically, you will be ok\\n\\n**Introduction to Cryptography – D334 (8 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed my first OA attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. Lots of memorization in this class. Just like all the other threads you will see about this course. Shawn’s Course Study Guide/Notes found in course chatter is all you need. The book is ok, but is pretty dry. Shawn did a very good job on his study guide. Its all you need! Get familiar with that and then do his practice exams for each chapter. You will pass. The PA and his practice exams were pretty close to the OA in terms of difficulty and style of question. Lots of memorization. I’m probably in the minority here, but I thought the subject matter was very interesting. I think about this stuff when I download programs and visit websites and stuff. It only took me about a week to finish this class, but I got pretty immersed in it. The concept of cryptography is pretty much engrained in me. Regarding the exam, questions seemed to be more skewed towards PKI, Wireless Encryption Protocols and Tunneling. These seem to show up the most on my exam and there were very few questions on blockchain/crypto currency and lightweight cryptography. The rest of the topics were pretty evenly distributed. It was a good introductory course in my opinion.\\n\\n**Managing Information Security – C843 (4 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Didn’t read any course material. Just read and did the assignment. You will need to do an incident analysis and response as well as a risk assessment. There is a lot of crap you are going to have to discuss and write about, such as legal acts, tools, techniques for gathering and analyzing, examination process etc…. It’s a very annoying assignment. I did not care for it in the slightest.\\n\\n**Cyber Defense and Countermeasures – D340 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- The CYSA+ is required for this class. WGU is enforcing a policy where accelerators can only have one class approved at a time and the program must be taken in a specific order….atleast that is what my mentor told me and won’t budge on it. The reason I’m mentioning this is because the order in which they have you do classes makes sense and does a good job preparing you systematically in my opinion. Every class builds on each other and the time you are required to take the CYSA+ is the right time. That being said, I felt the CYSA+ is a much harder version of the Security+. It went much deeper in security concepts compared to the Sec+ and I found some aspects of it to be rather difficult. However, all the Comptia exams you have taken so far preps you for the CYSA+. The cryptography class taken before this class, covers most of the cryptography questions on this exam. The digital forensics course that we have to take before this was sufficient enough to not have to do in depth studying for this exam. For studying, I just blew through the Total Seminar CYSA+ Series on Udemy and did a quick run through with things I was not familiar with the CYSA+ Certification Passport Book by Bobby Rogers. I did not do any practice exams. My lack of study was due to me being over confident. The PBQs were fun though. From what I remember, they all had to do with using nmap to determine what specific servers did and log trouble shooting. That was pretty much the gist of all the PBQs. They were pretty straight forward. &lt;750 is considered a fail…I passed with a 751 on the first attempt. Probably should have done some practice exams to get that score up a little. Pass is a pass!\\n\\n**Managing Cloud Security – D320 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed this OA by a slim margin the first attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. The instructor for this course was a relief because he just let me do it after I told him I reviewed the book the previous day. Normally they make you do a bulls\\\\\\*\\\\\\*t generic study plan and make you jump through a bunch hoops. Apparently the course was redone and a new exam had been made following the CCSP text book. This test was a doozy as there are 125 questions. However, just going over the book is sufficient. It was for me anyways. A lot of it will be a review which makes studying quite quick. It followed the book quite nicely. There were no curve balls and the questions were pretty straight forward. I’d probably say that the most sh\\\\\\*tty thing was having to memorize the various laws and frameworks. This is a must! You also need to make sure you are familiar with all the different frameworks and standards, quantitative risk assessment, uptime institute, data lifecycle, SOC report types, Software Development Lifecycle and Stride Threat Model.\\n\\n**Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis – D332 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\* This is taken from a previous post I made after I finished this class. Im reposting it here so you don’t have to search for it.\\*\\n\\n\\- By far the most difficult exam in my opinion. This was the only Comptia test that I failed the first time. All the Comptia exams kind of built off the previous and you could make your way around the exams without feeling completely lost. Pentest+ was different, the previous exams will help you very little. The things you really have to know are the commonly used tools and what they do. There is a lot of them and there are bunch of questions like “which tool would use for this?”. NMAP commands and syntax (very heavy in this), SQL Injection/XSS types and deciphering vulnerability logs. Make sure you have a semi decent grasp on SQL in general. ALL the different types of attacks that are commonly used. There are some that came up that I did not come across in the book. If you know the main/commonly used ones, you should be ok for the most part. Learn scripting! You will not need to write any per se, but you might as well learn because there are questions where you need to decipher/interpret various scripts and therefore need to know how to write them. Make sure you know the different syntax. For example, know how an array is written in PowerShell (there is a question in the exam where you will need to figure this out). Learn the common commands for PS, Bash and Linux. There was a couple questions having to do with common HTTP methods. There were not really any questions regarding the different laws. Definitely do not need to focus on that. You should know them anyways if you had just done the Managing Cloud class. The PBQs were medium difficulty. From what I remember, they were as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n1. Mix and match: You will get like a single line of script (or payloads rather) and you have to pick what kind of vulnerability it is and then you need to pick a method of remediation. Need to know your scripting and various types of SQL injection. This is critical. There will be like (10) of these you have to do.\\n\\n2. Scripting: On the right, there will be a block of incomplete scripting. On the left, you will have multiple options of code snippets that you will need to use to plug into the incomplete areas of the code. The code is prewritten for you. You just need to place the right snippet in the correct blank spot where the code is incomplete. There are twice as many code snippets then there are blank spots so you can’t just use the process of elimination. You kind of have to have some sort of clue. Also, the code might be in Bash, Python or Ruby. You have to be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n3. NMAP Interpretation: You will get a block of an NMAP scan result. Like above, you will have a bunch of options on the right hand side. You will be asked to put together the correct NMAP command to get the results shown in the scan output. Part 2 is that you will need to also pick the trouble areas (attack vectors) based on what the scan shows. There will be a list of options for you to choose from.\\n\\n4. Investigate Login Page: You will be given a login page of which you can view the certificate, source code and cookies. You will need to determine if any of those 3 things have issues. If they do, you will need to specify and provide a solution.\\n\\nThe Sybex book is by far the best book for this course. I did not care for the Sybex books in the other courses. Finding a good video series was difficult. I’m a total seminars fan, but this one did not do it for me. I hate the Dion materials in general and I’ve tried others on Udemy and Youtube and none of them were doing it for me. Another great book is Pentest+ for dummies. Very engaging. Lastly, you must spend time and do labs to understand the concepts. You’re really shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t. Look into tryhackmeDOTcom as well. I took the exam 3 days after registering for the class after a quick review. I thought I would be ok and I wanted to quickly get it over with. I found out in the first 10 questions and the PBQs that I was very underprepared. I took the test again a week later after intense studying and passed.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project – C769 (9 Days)**\\n\\nEh, it is what it is. A bunch of busy work. No need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look in WGUs database that has\\n\\nall the previous capstones that were rewarded for “excellence” and look at them for inspiration, ideas and see how they put theirs together. There is also a dedicated capstone page that will provide templates and samples for you so you will not be totally lost. I chose to propose implementing an “Insider Threat Management System” for a pharmaceutical company based on a scenario that I made up. There are 3 parts to the capstone: submitting what you will propose, writing the actual proposal and writing a post implementation report/reflection. None of it is difficult, it is just time consuming as they are asking for you to include a lot of stuff. 70% of part 3 is going to ask you for the same thing in part 2. I literally just cut and pasted the applicable sections from part 2 and changed the wording to past tense as part 3 is supposed to occur after you implemented your system. There will be a portion where you have to use outside references and cite books or whatever…just goto researchgateDOTcom query whatever subject you’re doing, pick however many you need from the search results that pertain and just read the abstracts and tie them into your proposal and cite them (already provided when you select a paper to view). This should save you some time. You are also going to need to turn in some sort of “deliverable” whether it be code sample, UML diagrams, operations manual, etc… I would suggest just doing a simple process diagram and explain each process. Its quick and easy and satisfies that requirement. If you goto apps dot diagrams dot net, you can build a nice one for free. If you want to be ultra creative and spend all your time doing the capstone on some crazy and innovative idea, all good. However, I would suggest you put in the bare minimum effort and move on, finish this program and get started on your new career asap. I WOULD NOT put any effort into this capstone! WGU doesn’t require it (they are just looking that you have all the things in their rubric). This project is not beneficial in any way and its not like you would be using it for a portfolio or anything. Do not waste your time on it. Read the requirements make sure you include those requirements and go.\\n\\n**List of exams from least difficult to most difficult:**\\n\\n1. A+ part 2\\n\\n2. A+ part 1\\n\\n3. SSCP\\n\\n4. Intro to Cryptography OA (Not difficult, but lots of memorization)\\n\\n5. Security+\\n\\n6. Managing Cloud Security OA (Due to amount of questions and material needed to go over)\\n\\n7. CYSA+\\n\\n8. Network+ (Information overload and acronyms galore!)\\n\\n9. Pentest+ (read review!)\\n\\n\\*I am awaiting to take the CCSP. I will be taking it in 2 weeks. I do not know how difficult it will be. Can’t be that hard. I’ll provide a writeup when I do take it\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2 things that may or may not help you…**\\n\\n1. There is a lot of information on the internet about how to study. Reading the text book through and through and taking notes is not efficient nor is it the best way and it is what is called “passive learning”. It is more efficient to do active learning. Which means…well…do active things when you’re learning…flash cards, practice exams, simulate teaching the material, physical home lab, etc…\\n\\nWhen it comes to studying especially for exams, my normal study habit is to watch a video series on 2x the speed or the fastest it can be where I can clearly understand it. You are trying to get an overview and have familiarity with everything. The video is visual and helps things stick. You’ll be surprised how much you can pick up. I will not take notes, just jot down questions of things I need to go over as they come up while I am watching. When Im done with the series, I will then look those question topics up and determine the what, why, and how of it to understand that particular topic/concept. Then I will generally do a practice exam, note question topics that I am not familiar with to look up when done. I will also go over the questions missed and then repeat then go over the same or another practice exam. It doesn’t matter if the test is not that similar in style/difficulty to what you are taking if you take the time to understand the concept. Comprehensive practice exams is my preference but anything that is “active” is good. You will figure out what works best for you. Just don’t read a book front to back, take notes in between and try to memorize it unless you like being inefficient and wasting your time…unless that is what is best for you. Lol\\n\\n2. Most of you already know this, but ChatGPT is your friend! By far the most valuable tool for me. It can be abused or it can be used as an extremely well-functioning learning tool. You are only hurting yourself if you want to try and use it for other purposes. When I would study my material and need to understand a topic like OSI models for example, I would write something like “Explain to me like a child what the OSI layers are and what they do. Also provide me an analogy.”. I cannot tell you how easy it was for me to pick things up when Chatgpt was able to explain things to me like im a 5 year old and provide me an easy to understand analogy. Analogies was a game changer for me. If you still don’t understand, you can have full conversations with it and ask it questions until you do understand it. Something like “I don’t understand, why would it do \\\\\\*this when it seems to do \\*that? You said \\*this. What is difference between \\*this and \\*that?”! Like full on conversations. Try it right now and see what I’m talking about! Use it to your advantage for learning. It is an amazing resource! Word of caution though, it is not always right depending on what you are asking or telling it what to do so when in doubt verify it.\\n\\n**My thoughts overall:**\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking: “ MmMMMmGoOoOo! BuT, bUt, BuT, YoU JuSt RuShEd ThRoUgH iT aNd DiD NoT LeArN AnyThInG! mMmGoOoOoOo!”. I learned the amount of material I needed to learn to get through the entire program and have probably come out with just as much as everyone else who graduated regardless of time spent. More than others in some cases. I also feel like I have a gotten a very solid foundation out of it, which was my expectation. \\n\\nHere is the thing, I would rather blow through the program and pay minimum tuition of $4k (plus get all my bonus certs!), continue learning and fill in gaps after completion at my leisure vs taking my sweet time and pump out the program in 3-4 terms and pay $12k-$16k. I guarantee I will have far surpassed that person’s knowledge on an intellectual and practical level by the time he/she is done. My learning will never stop, but my tuition will as soon as I can make it stop! Time is money. Massive acceleration is the way to go if it can be done…in my opinion. That is the beauty of WGU.\\n\\nThat being said, I feel like I’m just beginning, in that I’ve only dipped my toe and now the real learning begins. Now that I have the time and am not at the mercy of my term date lest I pay another 4k, I will go back and fill in my gaps and really start doing real world practical stuff and labs that I did not do. I did build a pretty intricate homelab that I will be using heavily. Anyways, I feel like this program did an excellent job in providing a solid foundation and I do mean excellent. I do not regret it in any way and I am in many ways more excited about this then I was with the Computer Science degree. That’s all I got. Good luck to you all! If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me.</td>\n",

Review of all classes.\\nThere are others that have made this post, but I think it would be helpful if people gave context to who they are and their level of proficiencies so that others can more accurately predict how the experience will go for them.\\n\\n  \\n**Who I am:**\\n\\n*  Early 30s male\\n* Wife and kid (toddler)\\n* Working full time while doing the degree in an unrelated field (High school AP physics teacher)\\n* No prior work experience in the tech field\\n* Did a Udemy course about 2 months before enrollment, which taught basic programming (Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python... and I did about 20 days of that and had never coded before)\\n* Have always had a strong interest in tech and computers as a USER. Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.

       "      <td>My Fun 41-Day MBA Journey - SO WORTH IT!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\*This is about my MBA journey, I hope to inspire, but don't be hard on yourself if your accelerated path is different\\*\\n\\nI was highly motivated and inspired by the post I read in this Reddit group from Sleyk2010, along with many other accelerators in this group and a few FB groups. Before I chose WGU for my MBA, I had my share of skepticism. I looked at numerous online and Brick and Mortar schools (I received my Bachelor’s from a traditional B&amp;M University). I completed my BSBM in a little over two years for a 5-year program (about 18 months ago), so I was already used to acceleration. I could have accelerated my Bachelor’s degree even more, but of course, I could only go as fast as the university allowed. I had to go the full 6 or 8 weeks for a course, even if I completed all of my exams, papers, and reading ahead of time. This led to me doubling and tripling my course load each semester. What drew me to WGU was that I CAN DICTATE MY PATH. I knew that I had a hunger for reading books, writing papers, and retaining the coursework. I am just maniacal like that, so I don’t expect everybody to feel the way I do about school. I knew I could crush my goals through acceleration because I know myself well enough and have been able to do it in the past. School is actually fun for me and if that makes me weird or crazy, I will proudly own that, lol.\\n\\nAll of this being said, everyone approaches school at their own individual pace and I am not writing this to declare that everybody will complete their Master’s degree in a matter of weeks or a few months. Everyone’s motivation is also not the same and how a person approaches school impacts how they set their pace. There is no way to “cheat” a degree. Everyone gets the SAME courses and the same coursework. Less than 10% of students accelerate at a pace where they can achieve their degree in well under one term/semester. The norm is that students will take two terms or more. Be clear that it IS TOTALLY OKAY. There is no “correct amount of time” to finish a degree. It is totally up to you based on your motivation, the time you dedicate to it, and your ability to absorb the coursework.  No matter how quickly you finish, be proud that you finished and that it took some hard work to get there.\\n\\nSo, let me get to the fun part. The Reddit and Facebook groups are helpful and great motivators for those who decide to come to WGU. It is a great school, properly accredited, and VERY reputable. WGU is also very relevant for the working adult and career-minded individuals who want to advance their careers. I am laying out a full course-by-course write-up of how I approached each course and how I successfully passed it. Let me be clear, this is how I did it and what worked for me, so by no means will this be a blanket approach that works for everyone. It is a lot of hard work and some frustrating days will be ahead, but trust me, obtaining your MBA is doable if you stay focused and put in the work. I don’t have any “tricks,” no rubrics, no papers to use for sampling, and no study guides to pass along. For the sake of academic integrity, I won’t risk myself or anyone putting a stain on the school or me for giving people the easy way out. If I had to do the work, so do you. I am offering some guidance and motivation for students in the program. Hopefully, acceleration will work well for you all too!!!!\\n\\nAgain, I don’t have any work to pass along, so please don’t inquire. If anyone feels the need to minimize and discredit accelerators, keep that negative energy somewhere because accelerators are the exception, not the norm, so this is NOT easy. As you will see many accelerators say, they will not apologize for busting their ass to obtain their degree faster than others. Some people are brainiacs, some are overachievers, and some are both. That is not a bad thing. Also, some Program Mentors are better than others and will be supportive of your path. My mentor was AWESOME and I came in with a game plan and strategy that she backed me up on. I made it clear that I was accelerating and would NOT be in the program longer than 45 days because I am on a mission. I am maniacal in my approach and putting in 40 hours or more a week outside of work to do schoolwork is not a problem for me. I can rest when I finish my degree. I do not suggest this for everyone. Plus, I have an empty nest with all my adult children out on their own. I had some downtime at work and figured no time was better than the present to get my MBA and advance my career. I will start with the Three Commandments of WGU, which I will cite as a source courtesy of SLEYK2010 himself (which are great by the way!!)\\n\\n*“The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.”*\\n\\n***To add as an addendum to the commandments, use Grammarly or some type of paper editing application for your papers. They will eliminate grammar and spelling errors on all of your papers. It is your best friend. Also, use Quizlet, they have very useful study guides to use for the courses.***\\n\\n**\\*Disclaimer\\* This is not the order I TOOK the courses in, they are in numerical order. My game plan was to do all of the PA (writing courses) first and switch my brain over to the analytical courses next (ones with OAs). I did C213 and C214 Back-toBack because there was a lot of cross-over between the two courses. I  saved C215 and C207 for last because of the cross-over and because I wanted to close out with the OA and PA course (C207).**\\n\\n**On to the courses!!!**\\n\\n**ORA1** – **Orientation** – One PA\\n\\nDo what you feel is best for the orientation. If you have done a lot of research on the academic program before orientation opens up, this “course” won’t be tedious. Follow the rubric, keep it simple, and peruse the “coursework.” It simply gives an overview of what to expect as a student and ensures that you are prepared to start your program. Be as realistic as you can be when asked about how much of a time commitment you can truly make each week to your schoolwork.\\n\\n**C200** – **Managing Organizations and Leading People** \\- Two OAs (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nYou will start with what is called the “Signature Themes Assessment.” It does not take hella long to do and when you complete it, save the PDF. Task #1 is a paper centered around the assessment that you took. PLEASE FOLLOW THE RUBRIC when you write the paper. Task #2 focuses on leadership that you experienced in your career. It can be a past or present company. You won’t be able to use actual names for the company or the person (or people) that you write about. Have fun with it, the assignment will be about your life experiences, so it will be easy to speak to either way. I finished both papers in one day, I just got diarrhea of the brain and my hands did the rest. This is one course where I will say that even though there is some reading that is available, it won’t be of much use. The readings are pretty much common sense type of stuff and won’t make much of an impact on the papers that you have to write in this course. Just get straight to writing and have fun with it.\\n\\n**C202** – **Managing Human Capital** – One OA (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nThis class was pretty straightforward in my eyes. I assume we are all adults here and have been a part of a workplace environment that involved employee interaction. A lot of common sense and work experience type of content is in this course. The technical aspects of this course (terminology and concepts) are in the reading materials and there is a Quizlet (get acquainted with this site, it is VERY helpful) that is very helpful for the course. I did some of the reading, but a lot of it was stuff I covered extensively in undergrad, so I didn’t have to deep dive into the reading materials. This is the Human Resources course of the MBA program. I took the pre-assessment and reviewed my weak areas. I skimmed the readings and reviewed a few Quizlets to help me prepare for the OA. It took me about two days total to do the reading, study, and pass the OA. Again, the course is not a beast, you will know more about the course than you will think. Some people may take longer to get through the course and trust me, THAT IS OKAY.\\n\\n**C204** – **Management Communication** – Three PAs -Two Papers and One PPT&amp;Video (Another Straightforward and Easy Course) \\n\\nThis course was actually a lot of fun. Tedious, but easy enough. There are some reading materials for this course, but honestly, they don’t provide much help for the actual tasks. I skimmed the materials to see what use I could make of them, but I was able to dive right into the tasks. Task #1 is a paper, but it will be constructed in a weird manner. The course is about professional communication in the workplace. You will be writing emails from the perspective of being a business owner or a supervisor. You will be writing emails to your staff, a business partner, and the stakeholders. The three emails will be fun to make, so don’t overthink the assignment.  Task #2 is a Powerpoint and Video. WGU uses Panopto for video creation. If you have never used it before (most of us probably have not), they provide instructional videos on how to use it. You should have access to Panopto as a student, but if you don’t, reach out to the IT department, and they will rectify that for you pretty quickly, usually within 24 hours. The video only needs to cover the points in the rubric and your PPT should be an outline of the presentation. Mine took over 15 minutes, but I am a classroom trainer by trade, so it was in my wheelhouse. Most people can truly do their presentation in less than 10 minutes. Follow the rubric to ensure you cover all the points they want you to cover and you will be fine. Task 3 is an executive summary. A one-page paper and you are good to go. All three tasks can be done by jumping in head first while the reading materials provide just a little help for the papers. I was able to complete all three tasks over two days.\\n\\n**C206** – **Ethical Leadership** – Three PAs (Straightforward but VERY tedious course)\\n\\nI did not personally find this class to be “hard,” but it is very labor-intensive. This course is similar to C200 in that you will be using another assessment called the “Ethical Lens Inventory” to start you off before your first task. There are 3 PAs and they are a doozy, lol. I honestly had fun with this class because I had a few ethics courses in undergrad and had to apply them in real life at work. The reading materials are enlightening and helpful but don’t be intimidated by any of the reading. A lot of the reading is stuff you have previously or currently face in your workplace and your life. I had a LOT of ammo to use for these papers, so the writing was pretty easy for me. Task #1 is to write about a leader you admire, a leader you know, or a famous leader. It does not matter; just make sure you cite any sources if you use someone you don’t know personally. Task #2 is focused on social responsibility, ethics in the workplace, and ethical leaders. You may find that your work experiences will be very useful for this paper. Life experiences can be the best teacher. Task 3 is a paper about leadership and the code of ethics. All three tasks will include life experiences and ethics concepts, so the reading materials are helpful. PLEASE make sure you follow the rubric to the letter for each task because it can be easy to miss a section and have your paper sent back for revision. I spent one day reading the materials a bit and two days doing the papers. Three days total. I wrote over 15 pages for each task, but trust me, many of you can do them in 10 pages, give or take a page. I do like to write, so I tend to write with extensive details, but if you like to keep things simple and just answer each section in a rubric, DO THAT. Writing a novel is not necessary, lol. I did get two excellence awards for 2 of the tasks I wrote for this course, so the long ass days of writing were worth it for me.   \\n\\n**C207** – **Data-Driven Decision Making** \\- Two PAs and One OA (Hard course for most, not very straightforward)\\n\\nIf any of you have read up on this class on Reddit or Facebook, you will see that this class beats people up. I can understand why it does. This is the Statistics class of the program. No real reading materials are provided for this course, which is why I say it is not so straightforward. There are TONS of PPTs and videos from the course instructors for this course. USE THEM. I personally love statistics and data, so I didn’t feel intimidated by the class. There is not a lot of math used in this course, it is heavy on concepts and statistical methods. Again, there are tons of resources in the course from the CIs, such as videos, study guides, and PPTs. Review them multiple times if you have to until you start to comprehend the material. Reach out to a CI if you need assistance, they are there to help. Quizlet is also helpful for the OA in this course because you will be using a lot of terminology. For task #1, you are forming a hypothesis that you will have to analyze for task #2. Once the evaluators approve task #1, you can move to task #2. The course will provide the framework for all the statistical methods you can use for your hypothesis. Most people chose a T-Test or ANOVA. I chose linear regression. I only chose it because it made more sense for my hypothesis. Use a topic you are familiar with for your hypothesis, it will make the task less painful. I used home values and mortgage rates because I work in the financial world, but I easily could have used sports for a topic too. For task #2, they provide videos and PPTs for each test that you perform and will show you how to input them in Excel. You will need at least 30 data points to use for the assignment but trust me, once you gather the info, it gets easier from there. Once you run the analysis in Excel, you will be writing a short paper (probably no more than 5 or 6 pages) that covers about 6 or 7 bullet points. As always, follow the rubric and keep it simple. For the OA, they provide a pretty good study guide and flashcards for the terminology, but Quizlet is an excellent supplement for this as well. The pre-assessment does not align heavily with the OA, but use it as a starting point for the areas that you do need to cover for the OA. My Program Mentor let me push this class to the end before the Capstone because I wanted to follow the Operations Management course (there is a lot of crossover between the courses). I honestly had fun with this class because I love Stats and Math (I am a math tutor on the side), so I didn’t lose my mind in the course. It took me about five days to read and watch the course materials, do the tasks, study, and pass the OA. Realistically, this course can easily take many weeks for people to complete and that is okay. It is not easy for most and you truly want to comprehend and retain what you learn in the course. \\n\\n**C211** – **Global Economics for Managers** – One PA (Somewhat hard course for most)\\n\\nMany people have stated this course kicked their butt and I can see why. There is a lot of technical stuff to cover in this course and if you are not a fan of economics or did not cover it much in undergrad, this class will be brutal. For me, I like this type of stuff and still use a lot of the micro and macro Econ knowledge I learned in undergrad, especially being in the financial industry. There are reading materials, study guides, videos, and PPTs available for this course and they are very helpful materials to use. Focus on the areas where you are the weakest because you don’t want to be in the dark in important areas that you don’t know. There are a lot of terms and concepts that you need to know and the study guides are very helpful in covering what you need to know. Use Quizlet too, it supplements the course material tremendously. There are helpful YouTube videos for Econ as well, so just know that there are many ways to skin a cat here to find helpful information. The pre-assessment somewhat aligns with the OA, so spot your weak areas and drill those down before the OA. I felt the class was not hard for me because of what I came into the class with, but I know that this class can be a lot of work for many. It is not a race; take as much time as you need to understand the course. It took me about three days to complete the course, but just try to get as much as you can out of the course and do it at your pace.   \\n\\n**C212** – **Marketing** – One HUGE PA (Straightforward and somewhat easy course)\\n\\nThis course was easy in terms of understanding the materials but the final paper is long as hell. You really have to APPLY what you learn in the course. I still remembered many marketing concepts from my Bachelor’s program, so I didn’t have to spend far too much time in the book. The concepts are easy to understand and there is no test, so just dig around a little bit in the reading materials for information that you need. There is no way to sugarcoat this, the paper is very long. It will likely be the longest individual paper you write in the program. With that being said, try to have fun with the paper. Many of the areas you have to cover on the rubric are based on your opinion of what you would do if you made marketing decisions for a business. Some of the technical stuff is in the readings, but a good portion of the paper is based on what you would do to market a business. My paper was about 20 pages, but I didn’t feel it was brutal. All in, I completed the course in 2 days. The writing was a lot, but not painful. \\n\\n**C213** \\- **Accounting for Decision Makers** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most, but reasonable)\\n\\nThis course is very technical and if you aren’t familiar with accounting, it may beat you up a little bit. However, if you have any accounting knowledge from your bachelor’s programs, this course will not feel so brutal. Being the nerdy dork that I am, I think accounting is fun. I still retained a lot of what I learned from undergrad and apply it in real life because I do my own accounting for my side business. I still got a lot out of the class and brushed up on concepts that I had learned before, so the class was not hard for me. With all of this being said, there are reading materials (especially the Hawaiian shirt guy who had a video at the end of each chapter) and a few other videos and study guides in the course. The materials are very helpful, trust me. YouTube even has a few basic accounting videos (just like YouTube has for Economics) that are useful. Whatever you do, just make sure you find materials that help you understand accounting concepts effectively. There is a lot of technical work to nail down for the OA and you will want to know and understand basic accounting concepts. There is hardly any math on the OA, and the minimal math used is not hard. Know your debits and credits, the accounting formula, and understand accrual accounting. Quizlet is also a useful tool to supplement the course materials. The course only took me two days to complete and pass the OA, but that is because I already knew the material and could grasp the new stuff. This is a course you may find will be useful in the future, so try to get something out of the class, no matter if it takes you weeks to get through it. Use the CIs if you are struggling because some of the concepts may initially feel foreign.\\n\\n**C214** – **Financial Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most)\\n\\nI won’t sugar coat it, this course is not as fun for me as the rest, lol. I don’t mind finance as a whole, it is just sooooo tedious. If you don’t have a finance calculator (I have had one for many years), make sure you get one. The preferable calculator to use is the TI-30 BAII. If you use any other kind of calculator, you are asking for your life to be filled with agony. Learn the basic functions of the calculator. The course provides a good video on how to use it as well as YouTube. However you do it, just make sure you know how to use the bloody thing. The great thing about this course is that the pre-assessment and the OA will provide all of the formulas that you need to use. You don’t have to remember the formulas, but you do need to know how to apply them and plug them into the calculator. This PA has much more math than the OA, so you will want to focus more on the concepts of Finance and how they apply to the real world. This course has some VERY helpful study guides, PPTs, and videos from the CIs. Quizlets are also very useful. Watch those darn videos 100 times if you have to until it sticks. You will not want to skate through this course, many people fail the OA, and many fail more than once. You can’t BS through this course, you will need to use the materials to grasp the concepts and enlist the help of a CI if you truly get stuck. The math part of the class was the easy part for me, I spent more time focusing on the application of finance principles and that was very fulfilling. I was able to learn things that I did not cover in my finance course in undergrad. I completed the course and passed the OA in a total of 4 days, but I came in with a pretty good foundation that really helped me retain the stuff I learned in the course. Remember, GO AT YOUR PACE. Once you feel confident about the materials, take that OA and put it behind you. \\n\\n**C215** – **Operations Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard Course)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I like this course the least, lol. The main reason is that I was not as passionate about the material. With that being said, I got the most out of this course. I learned a hell of a lot. There is quite a bit of cross-over with C207 because the manufacturing industry utilizes a lot of statistical methods (like Six Sigma, Lean, etc.).  I studied my ass off in this class and completing it was the most fulfilling. The reading materials are helpful, but they are dense and probably more dry than most of the reading. The study guides in the course from the CIs, Quizlet, and some of the reading from the book got me through the class. It is honestly that simple. The materials are there, they are straightforward, they apply to the OA, and they are tools to help you succeed in the course. It took about five days to learn the materials, study, and pass the OA. This course tends to stop people in their tracks and they drag through this class for over a month or more. Don’t be scared of the course. Dive in, learn the material, and don’t stop and start the course to drag it out. That is how you lose your momentum and the course ends up feeling sluggish. Operations Management will be very good material to retain and for people in factories or other manufacturing fields, you will be very comfortable with the coursework. I will also add that this course is one of the most important courses to use as a foundation for the Capstone.\\n\\n**C216** – **MBA Capstone** – Three PAs - PPT &amp; Video, One Huge Paper, and 3-part final task (Very Tedious Course but soooooo much fun)\\n\\nWoohoo!!!!! You made it to the end!!!! You will now apply all the valuable teachings from your other courses and roll them all into the Capstone. The Capstone is centered around a Marketplace Business Simulation. You will be the owner and decision-maker of a business and have six total quarters to make sound business decisions and get a simulation score of at least 0.001 or higher. If you fail, you have the take the simulation all over again. Trust me, you do not want to be set back because of that. Before you do the simulation, it wouldn’t hurt to read the Conscious Capitalism articles they provide. There is no book for the course, just the articles. The CIs provide videos on how to do each task and they may be helpful for each of you to use when figuring out how to structure your presentation and paper. Now, on to the Simulation. You are going to do the simulation for three quarters and pause. You will assess your business and review your decisions so far (you cannot go back and change them once you submit the quarter). Do all of Quarter 4, but do NOT submit it (or else you will make your life hell and screw up the simulation for yourself). Once you complete (but not submit) Quarter 4, it is time to do the PPT and video presentation for task #1. You are a business owner and should act as such, so wear some business casual clothes for your Panopto presentation. You are giving an update of the business through Q4 and telling stakeholders your business plan while asking for more money to invest for the next few quarters. Don’t stress over the PPT, the course provides a template for the presentation PPT and you just have to fill in the relevant information from your business. Most people can do their presentation in 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes. Mine was 40 minutes, but that is because I live for classroom teaching and presentations. It is fun and I definitely overdid it. Once you complete Task #1 and submit it, NOW you can go in and submit Quarter 4. You have to submit task #1 before you do that so the evaluators can go in and open the final two quarters. Now you will work on completing Quarters 5 and 6. My best advice is to be a conscious business. Your decisions should be centered around that because that is what this is all about, right? You can get a jump on task #3 while you wait for task #1 to be reviewed. Task #3 is a reflection paper on what you have learned in the MBA program, make a S.M.A.R.T. goal, how it will be used for your future career path, and include “career and education artifacts.” You will also submit your LinkedIn profile. The rubric will break it all down for you. You can easily complete task #3 in a few hours with the paper and the gathering of your artifacts. Beware though, you CAN NOT submit task #3 until you have completed AND submitted task #2. Just keep it on ice until you submit task #2 and submit task #3 a minute later.  Once you complete all six quarters, you will review your business results in Quarter 7. From this point, you will gather everything you need for the final paper in task #2. Task #2 will be long (mine was 20 pages), but there will be screenshots of graphs and other charts included, so it will not be 100% written words, lol. Follow the trusty rubric and just rock out that last huge paper. You ran the business and made all the decisions, so you will have all of the intimate details of the simulation and will be the best person to speak on it, so own it and tell your story! Whew! Submit task #2, then submit task #3 and wait for the last evaluations of the MBA program.   The Capstone took me about nine days.\\n\\nThe MBA program took me 41 days, but I feel if I didn’t have to go out of town a few times, give myself a couple of days of rest, and not lose a day to revise a task (Task #3 of the Capstone, my silly self did not upload one of my artifacts), I would have completed it in less than 30. I will still take it though and I am very proud that I still crushed my goal.\\n\\nOnce everything is graded and you get confirmation that your final task passed, you can now scream to the world….. YOU ARE AN MBA GRAD!!!!!! \\n\\nSoak in the moment, celebrate your achievement, thank your mentor(who will submit you for graduation), thank your family and friends who have been in your corner, and pat yourself on the back for what you accomplished. Then, wait about 7-10 days for the WGU Owl and Confetti to appear on your WGU profile page, which will officially confirm you are a grad and can no longer access your courses. The road is not easy and some may take longer to get to the finish line than others, but once you finish, you are a winner. No one will be able to take it away from you!!!\\n\\nGO OWLS!!! Remember, you can do it with effort and motivation too :-)\\n\\nON TO THE MSML WHEN MY NEXT TERM BEGINS!!!!!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Success Story - 60k IT job 1 week after graduation!!! 1.5 terms nothing to FT Job Offer. Full accelerated-BSIT Write Up\\n**Intro**  \\nHi Night Owls! I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and I've been here since the summer of 2023. I'm a 22y/o based out of the east coast (US). WGU changed my life. In this post I'm going to share my story and the result of 18 months of hard work! I'm also going to provide you guys with the best tips and pieces of information I've gathered from countless hours of researching the job market, reading r/resumes and other related subreddits, news articles, interviews, etc. I'm making this post as a way of reflecting on the past 2 years of my life and to give back to the community by sharing information &amp; my story. My DMs are open for anybody who has questions or would just like to chat!\\n\\n**Background**  \\nI was working as a security guard before WGU and I had a lot of free-time at work to spend on my laptop. I knew I wanted a degree but couldn't afford the tuition and didn't like the idea of graduating much later than my friends I went to HS with. WGU offered me a solution to both of these problems, and I was able to complete a LOT of school work during work hours (I had explicit permission from my manager). This was an amazing opportunity for me because I still lived at home with my parents and was being paid between $17-20/hr to complete school work. If this sounds like something that interests you, I encourage you to apply to Securitas, Allied Universal, GardaWorld, or Prosegur. Look for \"warm body\" sites- locations where you're paid to just sit at a desk in an empty building. Overnight and weekend jobs are great for this sort of thing as well. A good resource for getting into the security industry is r/securityguards. You won't need to carry a firearm if that's a concern of yours. Also, be advised, some states require you to have a security guard license. Personally I didn't have to.\\n\\nI knew I wanted to study IT so choosing which degree program to enroll in wasn't difficult for me. I chose to do the accelerated BSIT-&gt;MSITM program and had a clear idea in mind of the career path I wanted to take. I cannot overstate the importance of doing research on career trajectories from different degrees. The [WGU website](https://www.wgu.edu/) does a decent job of providing degree and career information from whichever degree you choose, but the WGU website alone is simply not enough. Interview/talk with people in the field you're interested in, possibly shadow them, start projects of your own- it is entirely your responsibility to create a plan going into this. Changing your degree program later down the road is completely acceptable but do understand the consequences associated with that (time, money, etc). On a separate note, it's a good idea to organize your school materials and whatnot prior to starting. I created a free [Notion](http://www.notion.com) to keep track of my schedule, save informative Reddit posts and other course materials, track my progress, create reminders, store documents, etc. Another benefit of learning Notion and using it was that I was able to put this tool on my resume.\\n\\n**Pre-WGU**  \\nI took as many courses on [Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) that I possibly could, prior to officially enrolling. I'm not entirely sure if things are the same with Sophia nowadays but when I did it, all of the courses/tests were unproctored and open-book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you do Sophia courses. I didn't do [SDC](https://study.com/) and personally I don't recommend it because their courses can take a while. [This resource](https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines) outlines what you can transfer in, for each WGU degree. I also transferred in the CompTIA A+, N+, S+ (these three certifications together are commonly referred to as the trifecta), because I already had them. WGU will pay for attempts for certifications if they are *required* for your degree program. I used to have a good transfer guide saved but I'm not sure what happened to it; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1390mx6/bsit_im_still_waiting_on_my_transfer_eval_of_my/) might be a helpful resource as well. Also, before you officially enroll, make sure to buy a webcam for the OAs. I use the Webcam 1000 which is what WGU recommends. It plugs into my laptop and works great. I've heard of other people buying one that has a tripod, so do some research and get whichever is best for you. Despite the scary proctoring stories you might read on this subreddit, I've never had any bad experiences myself. YMMV\\n\\nYou get assigned a Program Mentor before your start date. Mine has been extremely helpful and respectful of my preferred communication style and needs. I have seen reddit posts where people complain about their mentors- them wanting to schedule too many meetings, not opening classes, etc. This might be a good [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/16ybsoq/can_i_request_to_change_my_mentor_what_is_your/).\\n\\n**WGU**  \\nMy start date was October 1, 2023. I was able to complete 13 courses in my first term (a term is a 6 month period). I definitely recommend looking up the course code in this subreddit (ex: C268) to find resources. Here is some helpful information about the courses that stand out to me:\\n\\nC268 - This was the 4th class I had, and the real first challenge for me. I think it's like a meme in the WGU-IT community that we've all used [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pf6syi/c268_spreadsheets_video/) to help us pass. &lt;15hrs of studying.\\n\\nC962 - This class was the most amount of writing I've had to do in my undergrad. You'll enjoy this class if you like reading, researching, and finding a great quote to support your writing. I think I wrote my paper about AI or wearable technology or something. This class was &lt;25 hrs of work.\\n\\nC773 - I enjoyed this class a lot. This is an [exceptional resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1f12w4e/summary_user_interface_design_c773_passed_in_6/)\\n\\nD333 - I passed this exemplary on my first attempt but a lot of people have trouble with this class. I think that most of the names of the laws you have to memorize are self-explanatory. [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1d2f20e/d333_finished_in_3_days_passed_first_try_heres_how/)reddit post helped me formulate a strategy for studying for the exam, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/zhy5l8/d333_ethics_in_technology_updated_class_version/) post provides a lot of good learning material.\\n\\nThe CompTIA trifecta can be studied through [free courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/tcqdwh/guys_please_remember_that_wgu_gives_you_a_lot_of/) through udemy (all WGU students get a free udemy account). FWIW, I quit my security guard job around this time because I was offered an unpaid internship at my friend's dad's company. I'll talk more about this later.\\n\\nMy second term was from April 1 - Sept 30, and I was able to complete 3 courses (10 CUs):\\n\\nC954 - I spent a week straight in the library studying for this. Imo, this class is on par with the CompTIA A+ in terms of just how much course material there is. [This](https://onlinedegreeblog.com/wgu-c954-information-technology-management/) is a FANTASTIC read for those interested. Personally I loved this class because I felt like it tied everything together and gave me PRACTICAL insight into how companies (and specifically their IT department) function. If you're interested in additional learning opportunities beyond WGU, definitely look into Hubspot. It's a very popular CRM (well, it's more than just a CRM) that a lot of employers care about.\\n\\nC783 - I actually have weird circumstances regarding this class. I *forgot* to submit my CAPM certification prior to my start date. I reached out to my mentor and Student Support Services for help. My Mentor was able to fill out a form or something... and well, WGU made an exception for me. WGU makes it clear that they don't accept transfer credit after matriculation but they did for me, just this once. As a result, my program changed a little bit. I believe the BSIT is normally 122 credits but mine was changed to 138. Because I had passed the CAPM, the additional credits came from other courses, outside of my BSIT program, that were marked as Passed simply because me having the CAPM qualified me as having passed those courses. I never took the WGU OA for this class.\\n\\nI definitely slowed down in my 2nd/3rd terms and honestly I slacked off a lot. I was able to pull myself together and finish despite a lack of motivation. My third term was scheduled to end on the end of March (this month).\\n\\nC769 - My capstone project took me 2 weeks. Mine was about improving the security posture of a fictitious company. I really enjoyed working on this. If you're reading this and are about to start/currently working on your capstone, congrats on making it this far! I had a fun time using resources from my previous classes to work on this. I took this class more seriously than some of the others because I wanted my work to be a reflection of everything I've learnt at WGU.\\n\\nC777 - The dreaded Web Dev Applications. I took the Sophia course that is supposed to provide a foundation for this course so I didn't start with much knowledge. I procrastinated for weeks lol. PLEASE read the Study Guide. [This](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI) is a link to the study guide but I'm not sure if that link works, so please also refer to the 21day challenge document, sent in an email by your course instructor. I also watched the TraversyMedia HTML+CSS video a couple times and followed along with him. He will have you download SublimeTxt which is good, but I chose to use Visual Studio Code. The C777 study guide is your best friend. You're ready for the OA if you can score 90%+ on the practice OA, and if you feel comfortable creating a website. Another thing: some people may disagree with this, but for the purpose of passing your OA, try to not teach yourself additional information that isn't covered in the class. It can be a lot of information, try not to overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nD247 - I hated this class. This was my absolute worst class, and I just hated every second of it. My course instructor was amazing and I absolutely recommend that you review the powerpoints they've created- it's what helped me pass! The powerpoints will most likely be emailed to you. If not, please ask for them. One small mistake will flag your entire answer wrong for OA questions where you have to write code.\\n\\n**Graduation and my Personal Success Story**  \\nI applied for graduation on March 3rd and officially graduated on the 11th. I was emailed a link to download my WGU transcripts the next day, and was emailed a digital copy of my Diploma today (the 18th). I'm still waiting for my physical diploma and [regalia](https://www.buildagrad.com/wgu) to arrive. I'll be attending the Vegas commencement in April, hope to see you all there!!!! Maybe we can get a big groupchat together for people going! :)\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, I was offered an internship at my friend's dad's IT company. It was very informal and honestly a little disappointing but I was grateful for the opportunity to observe their work and go with them to meet with clients. I stayed with them for about 3 months or so and then decided to take a break to focus on my last two classes. Part of me regretted leaving my security job but I also didn't want to continue working there either. In the end, it worked out for me because I was able to put that \"internship\" on my resume and I figured that it looks better than no internship.\\n\\nI started to apply for jobs the moment I submitted my graduation application, which is what I recommend to everyone (if not sooner). However, it wasn't until after I graduated when I found the job posting for the job I got an offer for. I graduated on 3/11- on 3/12 I applied to this IT support technician job. I reached out to the recruiter (guide on that below) and we instantly connected. She helped me secure a screener interview (through Zoom) with the company later that week. I passed the screener interview and we set up an in-person interview yesterday. Honestly, I bombed the technical questions. I got destroyed in front of the CEO. I think I got the position because I spoke confidently and was transparent about my knowledge gaps. I arrived in a freshly dry-cleaned suit with 3 copies of my resume, and I took notes during the interview on my black leather padfolio (please buy one of these!). Every time they asked me a technical question I didn't know the answer to, I wrote it down, and said I'd research the answer. Also- before my interview- I wrote down questions I had for them, in my padfolio.\\n\\nThe job I was offered is a hybrid position and I couldn't be happier!!!! In 1.5 years I went from a security guard making 17/hr to making TC\\~60k in an MCOL, and I still live w my parents so no rent. Never, absolutely *never* doubt yourself.\\n\\nBelow are some tips I have for Resumes, Cover Letters, Applying, and Interviews. :)\\n\\n**Resume and Cover Letter Tips**  \\nYou already know that your resume (and cover letter) is extremely important, so I'm going to talk about how you can improve. Resume formats and the amount of creativity you can have really depends on the industry, so please don't interpret this as an end-all-be-all guide. This is more so for tech. Bluntly, you should have a pretty straightforward and easy-to-read resume.\\n\\n* Your resume should be 1 page unless you have 10-15+ years of experience. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jeg5ks/4_yoe_unemployed_tech_field_united_states/) is similar to what I use for mine (Idk why it's so zoomed in). Also please don't use a two-column layout.\\n* Your resume should be in an ATS-readable font such as Arial or Times New Roman (I use TNR for mine) and size 11 or 12.\\n* I suggest that you keep your resume in black and white. Don't use icons, shapes, or emojis. Far too often I see resumes with a little phone icon or something next to their phone number. These icons/shapes/emojis can look nice but they can also mess with the ATS (applicant tracking system) scanners, and also take the readers attention away from important details as they can be very eye-catching.\\n* Aim to fill the entire page. If you don't have enough experience or whatever that's completely fine, but there are ways to mitigate that. For instance you should use 12px size font, maybe expand upon your PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY section, make the size of your headings a little bigger, etc. You could also put a Relevant Coursework section in your Resume and name your WGU classes (don't include the course code \"C268\", just the name). This is what I did. During an interview, the hiring manager asked me about one of my classes!\\n* Your name/contact info section should contain your Firstname Lastname, phone number (xxx) xxx-xxxx, email (make sure your email sounds professional. Your professional email shouldn't be \"[gamerboy1206@gmail.com](mailto:gamerboy1206@gmail.com)\", it should be your name), a link to your Linkedin profile, and then city, State. Never put your exact address on your resume. That's a security concern and they don't need your address anyways, or at least until you get a job offer.\\n* Please, Please trim your Linkedin handle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNDY2KnXBw) for a guide on how to do that. Ensure your trimmed Linkedin handle is then put at the top of your resume\\n* If you have experience that isn't relevant to what you're applying for, put it on your resume anyways! Especially if you were there for a long time or if you really gained skills/experience.\\n* The bullet points under your jobs should NOT be pure fluff words. Instead, write meaningful statistics and hard facts.\\n   * \"Increased operational efficiency\" means nothing. Instead, you can put \"Achieved X through Y which resulted in Z\"\\n   * One of the bullet points in my resume is \"Efficiently handled over 100+ monthly calls, including inquiries, service calls, incident reports, technical support, and emergency responses.\" This bullet point includes an actual statistic, \"100+\", in a timeframe \"monthly\", and I specified the different types of regular issues I dealt with. Truthfully, I could have been more specific on \"technical support\", but I got the message across that I handled a variety of different inquiries. My intention there was to showcase my diverse skillset- again, there is always room to improve!\\n* WGU actually offers classes on Resume building, and will review your resume for free. You can find information to that [here](https://careers.wgu.edu/channels/resumes/). I did this, and the results were amazing! The more people you can get to look over your resume, the better.\\n* !! This one is very important. The end result of your resume should be a PDF. I've always used Google Docs online to create my resume. It allows me to convert it into a PDF with two clicks of my mouse. When you download your PDF, PLEASE rename it to \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_Resume\", instead of just \"Resume\". This will make it 1000x easier for hiring managers to see your resume and know it's from you. A lot of people name their resume just \"Resume\"... you need to stand out, and that's how you do it!\\n\\nIn addition to a resume, you should also make a cover letter template. Meaning, for every new cover letter you create, you change the name of the job title and company (written in the CL) to match the job you're applying for.\\n\\n* If you choose to make two templates, here is what I recommend you do: the first template should be called \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_CoverLetter\\_CompanyName\" and also \"FirstName.Lastname.CoverLetter.CompanyName\". That way, there is a slight difference between the two (that only you know of) and it still looks professional. For instance, lets say you want to apply to Helpdesk roles and Project Coordinator roles. The Helpdesk cover letter template could be the one with the periods, whereas the Project Coordinator cover letter templates could be the one with the underscores. Again, this is a very subtle way for you to distinguish between the two, so you can have a more personalized cover letter for the jobs you're applying to. This is actually what I do personally.\\n   * For example, my Project Coordinator cover letter is more geared towards PM/Project coordinator positions. It mentions my CAPM cert\\n* Your Cover letter should contain the same name and contact info as your resume. Same email, phone number, city, etc.\\n* Your CL (ideally) should be the same font and font size as your resume. I don't think this is necessarily required but the attention-to-detail can go a long way. I like the uniformity of doing it this way.\\n* As a general rule of thumb: the first paragraph (3-4 sentences) should explain who you are, the body paragraph should talk about your experiences, qualifications, why you want the position, and why you're a good fit, and the closing paragraph (2-3 sentences) should reaffirm your interest, express gratitude, and indicate your eagerness to discuss this opportunity/interview.\\n\\n**My 'Guide-to-Apply'**  \\nIt's vey rare that I'll hear back from an application submitted thru Indeed. LinkedIn is my preferred way to apply. I have LinkedIn premium (I highly suggest you try the $0 down *free trial*). I swear, it's what helped me get this job. If you get contacted about scheduling an interview, your next steps should be to research the company ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is an amazingggg tool for this).\\n\\n* Look up for tech job openings near you. Most of IT (and some CS) start out in job titles such as Helpdesk, Support I, jr IT specialist, IT technician, stuff of that nature. That's what you should be looking for. Don't expect to go right into cybersecurity lol. The reality is that cybersecurity is mid-level and senior-level.\\n* Have realistic salary expectations. A huge factor is where you live (understand the terms LCOL, MCOL, HCOL). But I think that a very general rule of thumb is that out of college you can reasonably expect between 40-65k for an entry level IT job, with the national avg being about 51k ish.\\n* GET A PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT TAKEN FOR YOUR LINKEDIN. Have your hair nice, shave your face or freshen up your facial hair, wear a fresh outfit, have a SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND, and just be presentable. You should want to look your best. [This is interesting:](https://www.earth.com/news/attractive-people-have-more-career-opportunities-and-success/)\\n   * DON'T put your headshot (or any pictures) on your resume. This might be a norm in other cultures but definitely not for tech jobs in the US\\n* Go on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and get a nice background for your linkedin. Doesn't have to have any text, could even just be a solid color with a gentle gradiant. Anything is (usually) better than the default background. Mine is just a blue background with some lines on it, it looks like waves. It's just an artistic thing. But I made sure that the tie I'm wearing in my profile picture is the same shade of blue as my background. I think it ties it together nicely.\\n* Reach out to a recruiter. I wouldn't have gotten this job opportunity without my recruiter's help. In my opinion, a good recruiter might feel like a 'temporary career coach'. My recruiter gave me advice, gave me constant updates, insight, etc. She was amazing. This is the message I sent her to initiate our first conversation:\\n   * Hi,  I hope you're doing well! I came across the *JobName* position at *CompanyName* and am very interested. I’d love to learn more about the key qualities and skills you’re looking for in applicants. Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to send my resume if that would be helpful.  Looking forward to your reply!  Best, *FullName*\\n* Monitor your email regularly. People don't like to be kept waiting, especially when companies may be interviewing potentially hundreds of other applicants.\\n\\n**Interviews**  \\nOne of the best resources for interviews (and resumes too) I've ever come across is chief.analyst on tiktok.  Even though he's in an entirely different industry (finance), I love his advice and how articulate he is. Being able to speak confidently and clearly is a non-negotiable. Never underestimate the importance of good communication- it's what helped me get this job after not being able to answer a single technical question correctly despite being up against over 160 other applicants.\\n\\nIt's typical for you to go through a virtual interview before being invited to an in-person interview. This is called a screener and as the name suggests, it's for screening out candidates who don't meet the qualifications necessary or those who appear to be unenthusiastic. Showing enthusiasm and positive energy is incredibly important- you can show this by asking questions, smiling, and knowing what the company does.\\n\\n* I mentioned this earlier in my Graduation section but invest in a padfolio. I think I got mine for $12 from Target. It should carry 3 copies of your resume (anything more is excessive) business cards if you have them (I personally did not), a pen (ensure that it works and isn't out of ink!), and paper for notes. You don't need your padfolio for a virtual interview- instead, I'd recommend you have your full attention on the interviewer. It helps to look directly at the camera (instead of your screen) so it gives the illusion you're looking directly at the interviewer, from their end.\\n* In my padfolio, I also wrote down questions I wanted to ask the interviewers, the night prior to the interview. Having pre-written questions made me look more prepared and took the burden off of me of having to remember them.\\n* Push in your chair after getting up, like when leaving your interview. Similarly- if they offer you water at the start of your interview, make sure you throw out the cup in a trashcan and don't leave litter in their office.\\n* Maintain eye contact and speak slowly. For me, it helps when I use my hands when I talk.\\n* Look, dress, and smell nice. You don't have to be a model but definitely make yourself look the best you possibly can. Also, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.\\n* I like watching CareerVidz on Youtube because he comes across as a little silly and that may (hopefully) take some pressure off of you. It's okay to be nervous, but try not to make it apparent.\\n* Rehearse your [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54).\\n* Research the company you're applying for, before any interviews. You can show a genuine interest in the company by understanding what they do and who they are.\\n* References: If you don't have any professional references, you can definitely ask a course instructor or your Program Mentor! They are here to support you and they will absolutely vouch for you (speaking from experience).\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI think it's incredibly important to continuously grow and improve regardless of which stage you're at- whether you're considering enrolling, have already enrolled, are about to graduate, or even if you're looking for a job. I'm hopeful that my write-up is able to offer a fresh perspective on the challenges and possibilities you might encounter. Sorry for any typos/weirdly worded sentences lol.\\n\\nI'm now looking forward to starting my MSITM on April 1 and starting my new job. If you have any tips/advice for the MSITM program, I'd love to get some info\\n\\nHope to see y'all at the Vegas commencement ceremony!!\\n\\nEDITS: Expanded upon my internship, additional random bullet points all throughout</td>\n",

       "      <td>D288 - Back-End Programming 2024 Guide!\\nHello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click &gt; new &gt; Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n&gt;Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: &lt;version&gt;3.3.6&lt;/version&gt;\\nLombok: &lt;version&gt;1.18.36&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\\n&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\n&lt;version&gt;3.3.6&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\n\\n```\\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;\\n&lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\n&lt;version&gt;1.18.36&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n&gt;MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n&gt;When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below. Other Reddit users and I will try and get to them and answer them accordingly. If a significant update/revision should be made to the guide, please leave a comment suggesting a change. I'll try and keep this guide relevant for at least a little while, but with the new degree plan coming, it will inevitably become superannuated.  \\n\\nIf you followed this guide and passed, **CONGRATS!** This is probably the most technical project I've done so far in my degree, and I had a lot of fun with it. So, I hope this guide made the class enjoyable for you too! Wishing you well in your future studies! 📚🎉</td>\n",

I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database &amp; SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&amp;list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching &amp; promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope &amp; out-of-scope), requirements (functional &amp; non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development &amp; testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.</td>\n",

       "      <td>D287 Java Frameworks Ultimate Project Guide\\nWGU students, by now you have likely experienced or heard how this course is low effort, half finished garbage. Well, since they can't be bothered to fix this course, it is up to us to help each other out. This post is my attempt to help fellow students with this project. After stumbling through this project for like a month and a half, I finally finished it and here is my best attempt at a guide.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly, get your IntelliJ Ultimate downloaded, and get your project files on your local machine. Check out my previous post at to get through task step A: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, so this project basically gives you a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and a myspace looking old school HTML user interface, and your job is to customize the code to meet a customers needs. You need to come up with a shop that will have 5 sample products, and 5 generic parts that can be combined to make those products. They give the example of a bicycle shop that has different bike types for products, like mountain bike/ road bike etc. and then generic parts for those such as seat, handlebars, gears etc. Do not overthink this, just choose something and keep it simple and generic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo know what the heck is going on, here is some background info. To get something like this to work, it is convenient to use a framework, something to contain all your different files and get them to work together the way we want, while offering tools and libraries to simplify development and let us focus on the logic and features of the application we are creating. Often used with Spring is Spring boot, a sub project of Spring that simplifies things for us even more by using embedded web servers so you don't have to install and configure a separate web server, while also offering auto-configuration, so we have less to do manually to make sure that any files/classes etc that depend on other files/classes/methods etc have the information shared to be able to carry out their functions. This project uses a common design pattern known as MVC (model view controller). This is a way to organize an applications files based on its function which promotes organization, modularization, maintainability, reusability, testability, and improves development efficiency. Now if you have opened your project, it may seem overwhelming the amount of files in there, so I am going to try to tell you what files belong to what part of MVC, and a bit about what they do so you know what you are looking at.  \\n\\n\\n**Model:** represents the applications data and business logic. Encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the app, including data manipulation, validation, and interactions with the database. The files for this project relating to the model are:\\n\\n* Entities: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;domain you have 4 .java files containing entities. These are your classes, for the different types of parts, and for products. Entities are marked with the annotation '@Entity' which tells Spring this is an entity, allowing it to work its magic to make these work the way we want overall for the application.\\n* Repositories: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;repositories you have 4 repository .java files corresponding to the entity files. Repository files allow for CRUD (create read update delete) on the database. These files interact with the database and are marked with '@Repository'. Note that these files extend CrudRepository which eliminates the need for the annotation.\\n* Service: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;service, there are service files and service implementation files. The service files contain declarations but not the definitions, while the implementation files have the definitions to implement the service. Services interact with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.\\n* Validators: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;validators, contains .java files that contains the actual validation logic, and annotation files that allow you to make a custom annotation to easily mark your other files with ('@CustomAnnotation') to get the validation enforced. Code that enforces validation rules and constraints for your data.\\n\\n**View:** responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It encompasses the user interface elements, templates, and visual elements that users interact with. Views receive data from the Model and render it in a way that's suitable for presentation. Views also capture user input and pass it to the Controller for further processing. The files for the view layer are:\\n\\n* HTML Templates: src-&gt;main&gt;resources-&gt;templates. These are all your html files that contain the format and structure for the webpages you see. This project uses Thymeleaf, a template engine that helps make dynamic html content.\\n* CSS: found in src-&gt;main-&gt;resources-&gt;static-&gt;css. This provides additional styling for the webpages to enhance the look and feel.\\n\\n**Controller:** These classes handle user requests, process input, interact with the Model, and determine which View should be rendered. Controllers are annotated with '@Controller'. In general, a controller in a Spring application is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate HTTP response. Controllers typically have methods annotated with '@RequestMapping'(or other annotations like '@GetMapping','@PostMapping', etc.) to define the URL paths they handle and the HTTP methods they respond to. The controllers are found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;controllers.\\n\\n**Other Notable Files:** There are some files that aren't included in MVC but are still important to recognize. These are:\\n\\n* BootStrapData.java: The purpose of this class is to provide initial data for testing and development, ensuring that there is data to work with when starting the application. This file is located at src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;bootstrap\\n* application.properties: a configuration file in a Spring Boot application that allows you to configure various settings and properties for your application. It is used to customize the behavior of your application without requiring changes to the source code. \\n* test files: located at src-&gt;test, contains files for testing your code.\\n* .gitignore: this file is used to specify files and directories that you want ignored by git when tracking changes in your project. I did not use this file at all for this project. Is found in target directory.\\n* mvn &amp; mvnw: These are files used to ensure the right version of Maven is being used to build the project regardless of whether you have it installed or not. Maven is a build automation and project management tool that simplifies the process of managing and building software projects by providing a structured way to handle dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging.\\n* pom.xml: is the Project Object Model configuration file used by Maven to define project details, dependencies, and build settings for a Java project.\\n* README.md: is used to provide a brief and informative description of a project, often found at the root of a repository, to help users understand its purpose and usage. We will be using this file to track the changes we make for task steps C thru J.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, hopefully that helps, I was completely lost and overwhelmed at first but hopefully that gives you some background and helps you see how the pieces fit together. If it doesn't make sense yet, it will start to as you work through the project and see how things work together and interact. Anyway, on to the tasks!\\n\\n**NOTE:** to view and test your web app, open your browser and go to localhost:8080. This will show you your webpage in its current state. You must run the application successfully in IntelliJ for this to work. You will be using this a lot to make sure your changes are working the way you want and you are meeting the requirements.  \\n\\n\\n**Task B:** This part is super easy, they want you to create a README file, but there already is one! What I did here was I kept the nice WGU and D287 header stuff deleted the rest, and then I copy and pasted the task requirements from parts C to J so I could type my changes for each part under the step it is a part of.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**NOTE:**  For tasks C - J you have to commit and push with a message to the remote repository after the completion of each step. You are allowed to push more often, but at a minimum you must push after each step is completed and put a brief meaningful message. At the end you will have to get the history and submit it with your zip file. I made a new branch to do all my changes to, and named it working\\_brach, as this is more common than doing work on the main branch. To make a new branch, go to the bottom right of the screen, click the current branch, and it will bring up some options. Click new branch, name it something like working\\_branch, and check the box for checkout branch so that you make it the branch you are working on.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task C:** For this step, you will be working in mainscreen.html. You will need to customize this page to reflect your custom shop choice, changing the titles and headers appropriately. Make sure to log the changes and locations on the README. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message. You can do this by clicking the git tab and then clicking commit, and it should bring up a commit window where your project window usually is, and then you can select what changes to commit, type your message, and select commit &amp; push. Almost every time I did this, I got warnings and it stopped the push, and I had to click push anyway. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task D:** For this part you need to understand some basic html. This step you need to make an about page, and so you will need firstly a template, so create a new html template with all your other templates (when asked if you want to add your new file to git, always say yes). This file will be where you create all the visuals for your about page, where you describe briefly your business and who its for. I just put some super generic stuff about how we care about the customer and giving back etc. I copy and pasted the first 12 or so lines from another html template just so it had the same styling and structure info as the other webpages. I personally tried to match the look of mainscreen.html, but you can make it however you want. Remember to catalogue each change you make in the README.md file. For example, if you add a title for your about page, you would put something like: -about.html: added title 'About' on line 15. You need to say what file, have it under the correct task letter, and say what line(s) the change(s) is(are) on and what the change(s) is(are). When you are satisfied with your about.html, you will need to make a controller for it in the directory with all the other controllers. The controller is being used to map the URL to  the corresponding webpage and guiding Spring on which template to utilize for rendering the content. Remember to annotate your controller with '@Controller' just like in the other controller classes, and you will also need the @GetMapping(\"name\\_of\\_about\\_template\\_here\") in your class definition to connect the template and the url such that you can reach this page and see it by going to localhost:8080/about\\_template\\_name\\_here. Check out the other controller classes to get an idea how for this, or watch a video on it if needed. On mainscreen.html, you will need to add a button that takes you to the about page you created, I just copy and pasted similar code for other buttons and changed the link for it and name to make this work. Similarly, on your about html file you will want to add a link or a button back to the mainscreen. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n **Task E:** Now you need to add a sample inventory consisting of 5 products and 5 parts. There is commented out code in the BootStrapData.java file that gives you an example of how to create a part and a product (in separate spots), you can use that and change it to make 5 of each. You either need to add an if statement that checks if the parts count and products count is zero before adding the sample inventory, or you will need to comment your code out after the sample is added to your page so you don't keep adding duplicates. If you don't add the logic to check for this, make sure to make a note somewhere to uncomment this code back out before you submit your project, or it will get sent back as they will not see your sample database get loaded in. (Hint: I used variables for part count and product count and set them equal to their respective repository classes and used the .count() method to see if both were == 0 before adding the sample inventory). Once you are done, commit and push with a message. Make sure you are logging all your changes!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task F:** This step asks you to add a Buy Now button next to the update and delete buttons for your products. The button needs to decrease the inventory of the purchased product by one, and make no changes to the inventory of parts. You need to display a message for failure or success of a purchase. First I would add the button to mainscreen.html in the appropriate spot. There is a table in mainscreen.html that sets up the products table, you will see it referencing tempProduct.name, .price, .inv, and then you will see the update and delete buttons. You will want to add your Buy Now button in here. The button here is a bit tricky as you need it to map to /buyProduct URL (we will make the controller for this later) and you need to set it up for http POST request so it can access and update the inventory amount for purchased products. You also need to pass a hidden input field so that you can pass the tempProduct.id along to the controller. I would post the code for this but I don't want this post to get taken down lol. Next you need to make a new controller to handle the desired behavior of the buy now button. Once you make your controller, make sure to annotate it as a controller. For this controller I added a private ProductRepository object with an '@Autowired' annotation, as the ProductRepository provides methods for interacting with the database which we need to do to decrement the inventory by 1 after purchase, and the annotation injects an instance of ProductRepository into this controller, which allows it to use the methods it needs. Just like the other controllers, we are going to make a public String method, I called it buyProduct. For its input parameters, you need to use the '@RequestParam' annotation to be able to obtain the productID from the product that was purchased over on mainscreen. Next I created an Optional &lt;Product&gt; object that assigns its value to the .findById method of the product repository, using the productID obtained from '@RequestParam'. By using Optional&lt;Product&gt;, the code handles the possibility that the requested product might not exist in the database. It avoids directly returning null when the product is not found, which helps improve code readability and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. This object basically represents whether the product was found in the database or not. Using that, you can set up if statements based on whether that object.isPresent() is true or not, and if it is true, you can create a Product object and set it equal to the optional object.get(). You can then set up an additional if statement that checks if that products inventory (product.getInv) is above 0, if it is then you can set the inventory for it to its current value -1 (decrement the inventory like the instructions wanted). Make sure to save this new value using the product repository .save() method to save the new count to the repository. If this part of the code is reached, then the product had enough in stock to be purchased, its inventory was subtracted by one to reflect a purchase, and now you can generate a success message. There are many ways to do this (as is the case with most of the project), but I personally made a new html template both for a purchase success and a purchase error. You can use a redirect statement in your return statement to the url of your success page for the case that the purchase went through, or to your error page if it did not. You will need to add '@GetMapping' annotations and displayPurchaseSuccess (or error) methods that return to the appropriate url. After the controller is all setup, you make your html templates for the success and error pages if thats the way you chose to do. These can be super simple, basically mine just said purchase successful or purchase error in big letters when the page loaded. When everything is working and looking the way you want, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task G:** In this step you have to add max and min inventory fields for parts, modify your sample inventory to show the max and min inventory, and update both the part forms to have additional inputs for the max and min inventory. Then they want you to rename the database file, and add code that enforces that the inventory is between the max and min values. First go to Part.java, and add the minInv and maxInv fields (name em whatever you want), you can also use the same '@Min' annotation as the other fields to enforce that it cannot be below zero, and have a message with it. Be sure to also add a new constructor that includes these new fields, and make getter and setter functions for them. Next go back to BootStrapData.java and add max and min inventory values for your sample inventory parts. Then for both InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm, add text inputs for both max and min inventory. You can probably figure out how to put it in there just by seeing how the other fields are put in there and copying it but changing as necessary. Then rename the database file, it will look something like this **spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db** you can find it in file explorer or finder and right click it and rename it to whatever you like. In the application.properties file, you will need to rename it there as well and make sure they match. Next I would create a method in Part.java that checks if an inventory is valid, by returning true if the inventory falls between the max and min values, and returns false otherwise. For both inhouse and outsourced part controller files, add logic that uses the isInvValid method you created to generate an error message if the inventory is outside of range. I used BindingResult to reject bad values with a message, look into this for the error messaging. Once this is working as expected and desired, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task H:** This step wants you to add additional error messages and more specific error messages, one for if the inventory is below the minimum, one for if the inventory is above the maximum, and one for if adding/updating a product would cause an associated part to fall below the minimum. This isn't too bad, adding some more if else type logic to both inhouse and outsourced part controllers will take care of the first two conditions I listed. For the last requirement, I edited EnufPartsValidator.java with some additional requirements in the if statement that returns false to check if any of the parts for the product would fall below their minimum if the product was made (Hint: p.getInv() - 1 &lt; p.getMinInv()). I also updated the error message from ValidEnufParts to be more specific. When you are happy with the results and everything has been tested and working, commit with a message and push. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task I:** Add two unit tests to the PartTest class for the maximum and minimum inventory fields. The course resources has a video for this. You go to the file, and use the '@Test' annotation, and then make two tests that look similar to the tests already in this file. For min, you can set the minimumInv to a number that you expect to be the lowest to be used for the program, its just an arbitrary test number. Then you use partIn and set its value to the variable you just assigned, and use assertEquals() to make sure that it works as expected. Repeat for partOut. Do all this again but for maximumInv. Thats it for this one. When it is working, commit and push with message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task J:** Remove the class files for any unused validators. This one was so simple it had me doubting myself. When you open the validators, it will tell you how many usages intellij recognized for them. One of them had no usages so I deleted that one. It was really that simple lol. Commit and push with a message. This is the last step that needs to be tracked in the read me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow double check you meet all the rubric requirements, watch the completed project video from the course resources and make sure you got all the right stuff, and when you are satisfied and everything is working, export your project to a ZIP. Next on Gitlab, go to the code tab on the left hand side, expand it with a click and then select repository graph. This shows your commit and push history and must be turned in. Use print button and then specify print to PDF, and save it to your computer. You must turn this in with your project ZIP. Finally, get the url for your gitlab by clicking the blue clone button and copying the https url. When you submit, you need the ZIP, the repository graph, and the URL. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI hope this guide helps, please let me know of any mistakes or typos, I wanted to do this quickly and move on to my next course. If you have questions feel free to ask, but just know I stumbled my way through this and by no means to I understand everything or am an expert. This guide does not constitute the right way, best way, only way, or most efficient way to do this project. It is just what worked for me. I tried to tell you as much as possible without just giving things away and getting in trouble lol.  When you guys finish this course, make sure to let them know honestly how you feel about the course in the end of course survey! Best of luck. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

       "      <td>WGU MBA - The \"Sort of\" Accelerated Adventure\\nJuly seems to be a good month for me. July 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from WGU in Business Management. After that was done, I wrote this post, to give my take on the \"Sort of\" acceleration I did through my undergrad studies. It's a long read...but...if you want context for this post...feel free to give it a skim: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu\\_bs\\_in\\_business\\_management\\_the\\_sortof/geijacp/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu_bs_in_business_management_the_sortof/geijacp/?context=3)\\n\\nFast forward to July 2021...and I just completed my MBA at WGU as well. Like I said...July seems to be my jam. My first Graduate Term at WGU started in October 2020, so I accelerated two years of course work, into a little less than 10 months. Not too shabby. \\n\\nNow, you've likely seen other posts. \"I accelerated my Bachelors degree (or MBA) in 2 weeks\" or something of the like. My point here, is the same as it was last time: I'm not racing anyone. I applaud those who were able to do in minutes what took me months. However, for those who are still with me here...keep in mind I work full time in the Tech sector as a Senior Program Manager, I coach high school athletics on the side, and I have a family that I happen to enjoy spending time with. That's why I title my posts as a \"sort of\" acceleration. I don't have every hour of my day to devote to classwork so I can hammer out 11 classes in 11 days; but I want to give back to the WGU subreddit, because I got a lot of assists from these posts and I want to help others, who may only be looking for a kick in the arse that they can do it too. I did what I could in the evenings to devote to my school work, and on weekends too. But, I really didn't sacrifice an entire weekend to school at any point. I enjoy sipping my coffee. I also just happened to have an Appendicitis during my MBA Adventure, so that didn't exactly help my cause! \\n\\nI gave a lot of advice and pro-tips in my Bachelor's Degree post above. But, I'll reiterate the important ones here, up front:   \\n\\n\\n**1)** Get a Business Calculator, (I bought the BA II Plus) and learn it. *Know thy calculator*. It will save you a LOT of time. \"But, hey OP. I have a graphing calculator. I'm good.\" Sure, but, you could be better off. The Business Calculator, when you get into the Financing Courses will legit save you a ton of time. \\n\\n**2)** Be nice to your exam proctors. They work in a call center for God knows how many hours a day, watching people take exams. Sometimes they'll ask you to do something that no other proctor asks you to do. Just, go with it. Sometimes I was asked to take off my Smart Watch, sometimes, I wasn't. Sometimes I was asked to take my hand away from my face during exams (I tend to rest my chin on my hands during exams); other times, I wasn't asked to do that. Sometimes I quietly talk through an exam question to myself, and sometimes the proctor would chime in and ask me if I was talking to someone in the room, and I'd have to rotate the camera to show I was alone; and sometimes it didn't matter at all. But, there's no need to make your proctored exams more stressful then they may already be. Just go with the flow. They're human, just like you and I are, and there isn't a single proctor out there like \"I'm totally going to try and get this person to fail their exam\". Be kind. \\n\\n**3)** Be patient when you submit papers for grading. They have three days to return it to you. *Pro-Tip*: if you can avoid it, try to get your papers submitted before the end of the month. There is legitimately a term ending at the end of every month; so the volume increases a lot at the end of the month. I generally found papers I'd turn in, in the middle of the month would get graded in 12-36 hours; whereas at the end of the month, you can bank on it taking all three days. For whatever it's worth to you. \\n\\n**4)** Regarding papers: I said it before, I will repeat myself: Follow. The. Rubric. Every. Single. Word. Of. It. If you deviate from the Rubric, it doesn't matter how much you write, or how eloquent you are, or what your experience is in professional writing in your career. You will get your paper returned. You could write War and Peace, and get your paper returned. Or, you could follow the Rubric, write two pages, and pass. Just give them what they ask for, because that's what they're looking for to grade.\\n\\n**5)** It's okay to fall behind a bit, or to stall out a bit. My term started in October 2020. I didn't even get to open the first course until November, because of a work deadline. You can catch up. In the MBA program, you have six months to complete three classes. Anything else, is gravy. \\n\\n**6)** Take the Pre-Assessment straight-away when starting a class with a proctored exam. Have no fear. There is no penalty for getting crushed on the Pre-Assessment, and there's no limit to the number of times you can take it. But, you want the Assessment Report at the end of it. It will not only tell you the weight of each section to better help you study, but will also give you an answer key to see what you missed. As a bonus, if you pass it, it unlocks your Proctored Exam (Objective Assessment/OA) right away, so you can schedule it. I took the Pre-Assessment straight-away for every class I had with an exam, and it helped me shore up where I was weak, and I saved time by not studying sections I aced. \\n\\n**7)** Get a Quizlet account. You're welcome.\\n\\nHere we go:   \\n\\n\\nThere are eleven courses to complete for your MBA. Six of them have a Proctored Exam, five are written papers. The Data Driven Decision Making course (C207) has both Proctored Exam, and two papers to write. I'm going through them, in the order I took them, over the course of ten months (one, six-month term, and then three and a half months of a second term). I took some cues from a post by [https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) and his Mega Thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/). I always like to give credit where it's due. They had a bit of a different journey than I did, but we also had some similarities. But, I did draw some inspiration from their post, which is why it looks similar! \\n\\n**Managing Organizations and Leading People (C200)** *– Two Papers*   \\nThey ease you in with a pretty easy class up front. First up, get the Signature Themes Assessment out of the way. I think it took me about a half hour ish. Download the result, and start in on your papers. I wrote both papers over the course of two days. Paper 1 wants you to talk about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Paper 2 is for you to use a situation with a real organization, but you have to redact the info, and make up fake names. Then you write about a leader you know in the org. No reinvention of the wheel here. \\n\\n**Managing Human Capital (C202)** *– One Proctored Exam (OA)*   \\nThis class was super chill. Honestly, anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content here as common workplace knowledge. Not necessarily every word, but you know what I mean. I took the pre-assessment straight-away without looking at a single word of the course, passed it, and then scheduled my OA for that weekend to give me a couple days to study where I was weak. Took my OA a couple days later, and passed. \\n\\n**Management Communication (C204)** *– One Paper, One PowerPoint &amp; Video + One Executive Summary*   \\nPaper 1 involves writing up a few emails and letters to your staff, your industry contact and your shareholders of your company that distributes a hot and fancy new product, depending on your chosen scenario. you pick. This is a class to have fun with. Level of Difficulty is not high at all. After Paper 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow. The. Rubric. Then you make a Panopto video. It's very easy. You download and install the Panopto (or use the web version). When it opens, add your PowerPoint you created, and start recording your presentation. My video was about 8 1/2 minutes, and I passed on the first attempt. Then write your Executive Summary of your PPTX and submit the lot. This all took me about a work week in the evenings, but if you had a weekend you could probably hammer it out in a full day, maybe two.\\n\\n**Marketing (C212)** *– One Paper*   \\nI've seen other posts calling this paper a monster. I respectfully disagree. Mine was ten pages, including the title page, table of contents and references. So, my actual content was seven pages long. Just follow the Rubric. I've seen other posts where they wrote 16+ pages. They must reeeeeeeeeally love writing more than I do. I don't add a lot of fluff. Just write what they ask for. You are tasked with writing a proposal for a hot new product from any of seven provided industries. (I work in the Technology sector, so I chose Technology.) This took me about a week, but I started this class the day after Thanksgiving. So, between Turkey Coma and Black Friday (which, let's be honest...due to COVID-19, there wasn't really a Black Friday, as much as there was me not wanting to look at school while I made leftover stuffing...and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...)\\n\\nI'm grouping the next two together. C213 and C214. Here comes that need for the Business Calculator. Friendly Reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Let it do the work for you. My best advice is this: Do whatever you must with your Program Mentor to get them to schedule these two back-to-back. Bribe them, beg them, or simply ask them. Taking C214 immediately after C213 is a game changer, as they tie into one another like Cookies and Cream. I asked my mentor about it; he sort of waffled; so I asked again, and he adjusted my Degree Plan so I could take them back-to-back. \\n\\n**Accounting for Decision Makers (C213)** *– One OA*  \\nThere are some calculations and math, but not too terribly much. I've seen other posts that say \"don't worry about the math, just focus on all the other class material and you'll be good\". False. Disagree. Nope. Spend time on the math. There's enough math on the exam that if you bomb the math, you're going to essentially need to be perfect on the rest of the exam to pass. I have a strategy on any sort of Finance, Statistics, or Math exams that include theory questions as well. I do the non-math related questions first. If I get to a question that includes an equation, I skip it, and come back to it. Save all the math to last, that way once I switch my brain to calculations, I don't have to switch it back. For me, that's helps bring down the stress level. (Having a beer with me during the exam also helps. Just saying.) I used the same strategy for Financial Management. This one took me four days, because I had a weekend in there that I could devote 2-3 hours at a time to, here and there. Otherwise, probably would have taken a week or so, with after work studying.\\n\\n**Financial Management (C214)** – *One OA*   \\nAnother reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Especially if you've never used a financial calculator before. All the formulas you need will be given to you on the Pre-Assessment and the OA, you don’t have to remember any of them. You'll find many things from C213 carry over here, so that's nice...and the reason I say do whatever you can to take this immediately after C213. Memorize the Financial Concepts as best you can. The math won’t be crazy tough, especially if you *Know thy calculator*. There are more non-math questions than there are finance math questions, but don't skimp on learning the math. Last thing you want is to start second guessing your non-math question answers, because you're not feeling too confident about the Finance Math questions. This one took me two weeks, an hour here and an hour there. \\n\\n**Ethical Leadership (C206)** – *Three Papers*   \\nI admit it. Writing papers bores me to death. With an exam, I can get in, hammer it out, and be done. Not so much with papers. But, c'est la vie. Another easy one, just a time suck because of having to write not one, not two, but ***three*** papers. Blah. First up, do the “Ethical Lens Inventory” task in the course itself. Pretty sure this took me a half hour or so. For Paper 1, write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. I used someone I used to work for. But, I've seen other posts that they wrote about Lincoln, etc. Write about different leadership concepts. For Paper 2, write about social responsibility and leadership. For Paper 3, write about the code of ethics and its various leadership applications. All three papers, including citations, was a total of 21 pages of writing. Took me two weeks, but in fairness, I was doing this right before Christmas, and decorating the tree, watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and wrapping presents took priority. I'm not sorry. :-)\\n\\n**Data-Driven Decision Making (C207)** – *Two Papers and One OA*   \\nI've read other posts basically calling this class The Devil. Like, bust out the Exorcism for this class, and burn it at the stake for heresy. Honestly, I didn't think it was all that horrible. But, I enjoy data, so to each their own. It took me three weeks. First, form a hypothesis, then you complete Paper 1, which is a form they provide, and turn it in. Then, the data fun starts. Follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis option from the list. I will say this, don't overly complicate things, regardless of how much you like data. Use the T-Test. It's the simplest one, requiring the least amount of data, and therefore has the least friction. You could choose others, but that's like deciding to run a full marathon when you registered for a half-marathon. Not like you're going to get two medals for finishing. Anyways, plot the numbers in Excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for 30 data points. (*Pro-Tip*: Make sure you have the add-on installed in Excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions if you don't). You have to write Paper 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. I was able to get data from my wife's place of work, so this probably made things easier for me too. After Paper 2 passes, then it's time for the OA. Remember when I said \"Get a Quizlet account\" up above? You should use it here. If you're not a data person, take your time. Data isn't an easy topic for many people, so put on your Patience Hat, and grab a beer while you study. \\n\\n**Operations Management (C215)** – *One OA*   \\nSo, I've spent some of my career in Ops Management, so I breezed through this one. I wish I had some pearls of wisdom to share here. I was done in four days, and that's only because the closest OA I could schedule when I wasn't at work...or at near midnight was four days after I took the Pre-Assessment. Topics included supply/demand, operations and employee functions, and process improvement. But again, I've worked in this field, and when I passed the Pre-Assessment with Exemplary across the board, I didn't even bother to crack the study material. So, you may want to search for another sub-Reddit thread that goes into detail here.  \\n\\n**Global Economics for Managers (C211)** – *One OA*   \\nIf you pay even a small bit of attention to business environments, the economy, currency exchange, global corporation behavior, this won’t be a headache. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge on my part. I took the pre-assessment right away as per usual, then scheduled the OA for later that week. Took about 6 days from start to finish. But, this was my last OA, and a cause for celebration! \\n\\n**MBA Capstone (C216)** – *One Business Simulation + Three Papers*   \\nPaper 1 is a PowerPoint presentation + Panopto video (Exactly like C204 above). Task 2 is a pretty lengthy paper as a Stockholder Report (mine was 19 pages); Paper 3 is basically submitting your resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and a tiny paper on what you learned during the MBA that helped you on the Capstone Simulation (mine was 5 total pages, including the cover page and Table of Contents). \\n\\nOf all the courses I have taken with WGU, including my Undergraduate course load, this was by far my most favorite. An actual workplace simulation of opening your own small business. There is a lot of work to do for this course, as there should be for a culminating final of a graduate level degree program. All up, I spent close to three weeks on this sucker. I could have done it faster, but I wanted my presentations to be air tight. Also...above I mentioned an Appendicitis. Well, this is when it hit, was during my Capstone. So, take that into consideration as well. Start off with the simulation. The simulation consists of a start-up business and it's first six quarters of operation that you have to get through. After you get to the end of Q4, you have to stop and that is the information you use for Paper 1 (the PPTX presentation/video) to justify your decisions you've made up to that point.  You actually cannot progress to Q5 and Q6 in the simulation until you pass Paper 1. Don't forget: Follow. The. Rubric. To. The. Letter. This is basically a sales pitch to potential investors in your business. Also, this is where you have to be in professional dress for the camera, so ditch the hoodie and put on a collared shirt. *Pro-Tip 1*: Submit Paper 1, then submit Q4 in the Simulation, in that order. Don't submit your Q4 decisions before turning in the Paper. *Pro-Tip 2*: Do the \"Final Check\" each quarter before you submit your results. Don't deviate from that. You can really screw yourself if you muck something up and submit it. The Final Check looks for errors. Once you pass Paper 1, you'll be able to move on to Q5 and Q6. \\n\\nNext, you'll complete the final two quarters, then comes Paper 2, the Stockholder Report. To beat the long dead horse, Follow. The. Rubric. This isn't going to be a short paper, so buckle up, and knuckle down. This paper is written as a narrative, so don't use the Bullet Points from the Task 2 explanations. You don't want it written as a Book Report; you want to tell the graders a story about why you did what you did, and when you did it, and why you did it.  You'll download reports from the simulation, and take screenshots, and have appendices. But, you can do it, because you're storytelling. Since you made the decisions along the way, you know why you did what you did. You just have to explain it, like you're telling a story about it. I found it to be very fun, and I learned quite a bit by doing it. Again, easily my most favorite class I took at WGU. Once this one is submitted, you're basically in the clear. All the grinding work is done, and Paper 3 awaits...and...they sure do lob you a softball on this one to swing at.\\n\\nPaper 3 is writing a quick explanation of of three competencies you used throughout the MBA program that helped you successfully complete the simulation. You'll then create a SMART goal about your career. Then you discuss and attach three artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification or other that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future. (I used my undergrad degree, and two professional certifications I have - my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and my PMP Certification as my three.) Then update your resume (make sure WGU is listed as the latest school with the expected degree end month and year). Then, print off your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or create a profile if you don't have one). But...don't trip at the finish line! **Follow. The. Rubric.** You don't want the final thing you have to do to be having to re-do a cupcake Paper because you hit Auto-Pilot. Submit the lot. Once you punch submit that last time, sit back and remember Advice Point 3 from above, about being patient while they grade papers. Head to the pub, and drink a well earned beer. Maybe add some Chili-Cheese Fries, for posterity. Just sit and wait to see the good news email hit your Inbox with that glorious subject line \"**You Passed!**\" You did it!!! You made a choice to get your MBA...and now...it's yours! Your program mentor will call or email you very soon. They'll gush about how awesome you did. You'll get an email from Records, that your Mentor submitted you for graduation. Fill that application out when the email comes through. It'll take a couple days to process your degree; and within a couple weeks, you'll get a digital degree you can use online, and shortly thereafter, a package from your Mail Carrier with a super rad piece of paper within, declaring that WGU certifies you to be a master of all things business administration related!\\n\\nCongratulations to you, you're now the proud owner of a Graduate Degree. Now, when you see career opportunities that say \"MBA Required\"; you get to smile; and that's a pretty rad feeling. \\n\\nAnd to you...yes you...reading this wondering if you should enroll. You have obligations. You don't know if you can carve out the time. You work yourself to the bone, and barely have time to sleep. You can do it. I legit work 50+ hour weeks, then I go coach high school sports, then I like to have free time and spend it with my family. Oh...one other thing...I also run marathons competitively. Do you know how long a 23 mile training run takes on a Sunday morning? You don't want to know. But, I made a decision. I knew I could sacrifice some time to open doors that were closed to me previously. Because, it doesn't take forever to get that MBA. It only takes a little time, right now. The longer you delay, the longer it will be before you finish. \\n\\nYou can do it. You can. You just have to make the choice. I don't know you. I will never meet you. I don't know your story, or how you got to where you are right now that lead you to this post. But...I believe in you. But, me believing in you isn't good enough. YOU have to believe in you too. So, stop reading this, and get cracking on that MBA. It's already printed off. It just needs to know your name so it can find it's way to your mailbox and live out it's days, decorating your wall in a diploma frame. :-)\\n\\nGood luck!</td>\n",

Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try. Go here:  [**https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl**](https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl)\\n\\nC204 – Management Communication – **Very Easy Class. 1 Paper, 1 PowerPoint Presentation and Video + 1 Executive Summary**.  This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job  well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qc5bhx6kre051.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e976844dd1590b122f3580644ec34cbf84c5d8)</td>\n",

I think that anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content of this class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance** of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens” the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA. If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try.

This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video, using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7 minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**. This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3 papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about 20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work. Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task 1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3 papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**. This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**. Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15 separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References*** page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from. Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.( Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love, love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class** I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3 freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**. I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me, it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards, passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially in this current political climate with the current president and the state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked, then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**. This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1 paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**. This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets, passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment. Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out. Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**. For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY** formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not, I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management, same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3 math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable, just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**, to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself. Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones, skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on. Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**. I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand, operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with, along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always, then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1 PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**. This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace” conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6 “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game. And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators) and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass, you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity** that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about 15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.) Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in, it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2 and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim, then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past. Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin, create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy. Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA. Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree. Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gnvb6f2ere051.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=716b83558c25039900e6965c1d264339be2dea09)</td>\n",

       "      <td>One-Term MBA Thread\\nSpecial shout-out to [u/Sleyk2010](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) &amp;  [u/Hypermatrix2075](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hypermatrix2075/) your threads totally helped me 1/ understand that it was possible to accelerate and 2/ how to actually do it! You also inspired me to keep a little log of what helped me, and I thought I would post it in case it could help others. This is a thread that introduces me, why I went with WGU, resources that helped me, a class-by-class breakdown, and my overall thoughts after finishing.\\n\\n# A little bit about me:\\n\\nI have a degree in business that I got from a traditional university. I have worked in marketing in corporate America for the past 7 years and have been in business classes for 15 years. I do not have any kids and my work schedule is pretty light. I didn’t plan on accelerating through this program when I signed up, the original plan was 18-months or 1-year if I really pushed myself. After research I found out It really is doable in one-term. For me that meant committing large chunks of time at once - If you have a family, outside obligations, aren’t familiar with business, and/or work 60+ hours a week - do not compare your progress to me because idk how you’re doing this at all, you're awesome. Lots of folks in these situations finish in one term as well, but I think they approach the program differently. I also have a natural affinity for multiple-choice tests and while I am not a stellar writer - Grammarly and forced motivation work wonders.\\n\\nI wanted my master’s degree because it’s always been a goal, my work was paying for it, it helps qualify me for more senior roles, and I would really like to teach community college/university later in life (I know an MBA isn’t required, but it's nice to have). I didn’t need a fancy degree from a top MBA program because I already have a great job and do not have the time/patience to commit to a brick &amp; mortar approach. I had always heard about WGU, but once I looked into it: it served my purposes, is non-profit, and pretty well respected - so I was sold!\\n\\n## How I prepared:\\n\\nI got everything squared away with registration about a month before my term started and I used that time to prepare as much as I could. I read the reddit threads and Facebook groups a ton. I did a lot of general internet searching too because I wanted to learn about WGU, how people approached classes, studied, etc.\\n\\nI then started a google doc I called “MBA Resources'' as a way to put everything I thought might be helpful in one place. I listed out links to overall resources (threads, groups, websites) and then made sections for each of the 11 classes. Under each class I highlighted the deliverables for each class (1 Exam/OA, 2 PAs/Papers) and pasted the class-specific paragraph from each reddit mega thread. Lastly, as I read and searched the Facebook group, I compiled resources under each class on the google doc (ex. Dr. V’s bootcamp for C207, quizlet link, etc.) That way when I enrolled in the class I didn’t need to hunt for things. I could scroll in my resource document and read each person’s experience with the class and see resources that people found helpful. I didn’t necessarily know what everything meant or where it would be in the portal, but it offered me a place to start once I enrolled in a particular course. When I finished a course, I moved it to the completed section and wrote my own little paragraph that I would later post as this mega-thread. This approach really served me well, when I (finally) received access to my classes I had a good understanding of how the program worked, knew what generally to expect, and had a place to start when entering each new course.\\n\\n## Resources:\\n\\n● [WGU Course List Guide - Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1clcNTu5cHTbPa6IZfamRF4BoF0fyca6Jned0HePtcB0/htmlview?fbclid=IwAR1GV-x4dwprk79gK_WsNFfbOD3XoaPhD6qJUuHi_SmzMk9im-g8IK6DAv0)\\n\\n● [Masters of Business Administration - Night Owl Pro Tips](https://nightowlprotips.com/?page_id=39)\\n\\n● Grammarly Premium Discount - [https://gram.ly/DSDq](https://gram.ly/DSDq)\\n\\n● Free Office 365 (This is great to have for PowerPoint and as a final check for papers before you turn them in.

The math classes provide formula sheets, and every test has a pre-assessment which will give you a great place to start the materials. Definitely look up how to set-up your webcam, I ended up doing exams at my dining room table because my office had too much stuff around (screens, junk etc.)\\n\\nPerformance Assessments - I was scared going into this because a lot of the feedback from folks who were drafting 10-15 page papers. My longest paper was my marketing and capstone papers which were hovered around 10-15 with visuals and an appendix. Most papers aren't that long, as long as you are addressing each section w/ supported citation where required you will be fine - these don’t have to be novels. Getting to your point concisely is a huge skill needed for work in business.\\n\\nGrading - This can take up to three days, but I don't think I ever waited more than a day or two. If you’re anxious like me, your best avenue for notifications is text messages. Opt-in to the text notifications, save the number and give it a different text tone, that way you know the moment something comes back. The app notifications are never current, and the emails are a bit delayed.\\n\\nThe Three Rules of WGU Coursework (Updated from my view)\\n\\n● Papers/PA’s: Follow the Rubric, every single time. (Seriously, use it as your outline)\\n\\n● Exams/OA’s: Start with the pre-assessment (most of the time), then move on to the flashcards and study guides, and fill in with resources as needed. Once you feel ready, schedule that test so you have the motivation to study. Whether it's a few hours from now or this weekend… Having that set time is going to help you get ready. Study your PA just before you take it. Breathe and relax.\\n\\n● Exams and Papers: If your paper has revisions or you fail your OA don’t be discouraged!\\n\\na. Exams - Study again and retake. (No more than a few days)\\n\\nb. Papers - Review the evaluator’s comments and add in the missed or omitted work and resubmit. Make sure to reference your updates in the notes section of your additional attempt. (Try for the same day)\\n\\n# MBA Courses\\n\\n## C200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People\\n\\n## Deliverables: 2 Papers; 0 Exams\\n\\nThis class was quick, writing the first paper was like riding a bike but it started slowly. I carved out the day to write the paper (outlined with the rubric and just started plugging away). The WGU Library works great to find sources, you only need three sources for one section of each paper. The first paper I filled in all the sections and made sure my sources were cited and did a Grammarly run through and submitted. I started the second paper but that's when motivation left, and I pivoted to C202. I revisited the paper the next day after passing my C202 OA which was the motivation I needed to tackle this paper. I liked this second paper a lot less but just wrote about my former workplace - used the rubric as an outline, found the sources and submitted. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C202 – Managing Human Capital\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nThe popular quizlet people use was more reflective of the Pre-OA than the test and according to my Pre-OA there were a few wrong answers on it too (be careful out their folks, not all resources are created equal). I would stick to book end of chapter quizzes instead of using the quizlet. I just took the Pre-OA and studied what I got wrong, definitely focused on the laws. Find a mindset that’s a balance between HR being “the good guy” but also you are there to protect the company, that's where the right answers are. I took the Pre-OA and then set my test for 1.5 hours later, studied in between that time and passed. (1 Day)\\n\\n## C204 – Management Communication\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Paper, 1 PPT &amp; Video, 1 Exec Summary\\n\\nThis class is very doable, make sure you address the main chunks of the chosen situation but, outside of that go with where your mind wanders. If you’ve worked in business, writing these comms should be cake. Once you’ve finished, evaluate them as an outside party using your own thought processes and concepts from the book. For task two I used my communications from Task 1 to guide my presentation and exec summary. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C211 – Global Economics for Managers\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nI took macro/micro in undergrad, so this material was somewhat familiar (once I reviewed the materials). I used a teach-back PowerPoint from the MBA Facebook group that someone made which was super useful - I created physical flashcards from this. I should have reviewed this entirely before taking the Pre-OA but didn't because it was so long. I ended up barely passing and scheduling my exam for the next day to force myself to study. Once you review the PPT, take the Pre-OA (don't take the quizlet before the Pre-OA - it’s the exact questions), and then study that Pre-OA because while the questions weren’t the same on the OA the concepts were similar/adjacent. Once you review these, move on to the 267-question Quizlet and review the top 3 areas annotated PowerPoint decks (the professor emailed to me after passing the Pre-OA) - these were amazing. I actually found the OA easier than the Pre-OA but, that’s probably because I was prepared. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C206 – Ethical Leadership\\n\\n## Deliverables: 3 Papers; 0 Exam\\n\\nI really didn’t want to do this class to the point where I forced myself to complete the first task and rewarded myself with pivoting to ECON (?). I did get to write about someone in music as a leader which was fun. The megathreads weren’t lying; this was tedious but, like any PA, just start tackling sections and hop around if needed. This is the first class my PAs needed revisions because I either missed the mark on a point or completely forgot something, but just addressed those highlighted areas and ended up passing the second time around. (6 Days)\\n\\n## C213 Accounting for Decision Makers\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nFairly basic accounting class, I would start off by taking the PA to gauge my understanding of the concepts and test out how you work out the calculations. I took three accounting classes in undergrad, so I knew I just needed a refresher. This was the first PA I didn’t score competent on but was still able to schedule the OA (I think because I was close?). I went through the PA question by question studying the answers and looking up concepts/terms in the book. The same cheat sheet you get on the PA is on the OA - which is so helpful. I saw someone say they didn’t need a calculator or whiteboard for this class and that’s BS - the math isn’t hard but, I needed both. The quizlet was helpful for the terms but, I actually just ran through the PA again (mainly to work through the math). (1 Day)\\n\\n## C212 – Marketing\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Paper\\n\\nOffta had this class open longer than a week because I did not want to write this paper. I am a marketer by trade, what was I doing?!?! The trouble was getting started and committing to the products. I think the global aspect also threw me, I outlined this paper and then did not return for a long while. But, in reality this paper is a piece of cake - commit to two products from a business you know and pick a US-like country to expand in. Detail how you would roll those products out, highlighting some book aspects for what you should look out for when thinking globally. I ended up writing the paper in one very long afternoon - it doesn’t have to be as long as the threads lead you to believe. (2 Weeks)\\n\\n## C207 – Data-Driven Decision Making (Rev4)\\n\\n## Deliverables: 2 Papers (2 Analysis + 2 Reports), 1 Exam\\n\\nAfter finishing 7 classes in just over a month this is where I hit a wall. I opened this class, made a paper outline and then just didn’t come back to it for over a month. It really is not hard; it is just tedious and disorganized. Everyone is at their own pace and there is no shame in taking a break if you need one - just make sure you come back.\\n\\nAs far as the PAs, there is an outline of responses for Task 1 in the Facebook group which is good to help you think about what to address where. The set-up for this class changed mid-2022 so you are given the data for both tasks rather than choosing it yourself, which I think is better. Each task has associated videos to do the analysis and practice documents which help illustrate what you need to do for the papers. These were invaluable. I dragged my feet here but kept coming back, adding a little every now and then over about a week.\\n\\nI took the pre-assessment after finishing the tasks without any preparation just to gauge where I was. I didn’t pass and then closed my laptop for yet another month -\\_- I then sucked in up and studied the Pre-OA answers, used a study guide from the Facebook group, and then reviewed some decks from the instructor (Chapter 2 &amp; 5 / 6 expresses, the “Are You Smarter Than a C207 grader?”). Pay special attention to the top competencies, but don’t overthink it. I set my OA for 7 hours ahead of time and used that time to cram. (9 Weeks, yikes…only about 1.5 weeks of actual work)\\n\\n## C215 – Operations Management\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nThis one for me was pretty straight forward, I took the exam the day after I passed the c207 exam. I think you could do it either way because there is definitely some overlap with C207. I took the pre-assessment blind and got just under competent. From there I used a study guide from the FB group and studied the section I totally bombed, which was the JIT section. The Terms/Definitions and Glossary PDFs from the course resource page were really helpful. I work in program/project management so it was cool to learn about where a lot of that methodology comes from and the origins make a lot more sense in the manufacturing sense. The OA was harder than the pre-assessment (study pre-OA and expand on those concepts). Pay special attention to plan concepts and layouts. (1 Day)\\n\\n## C214 – Financial Management\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nI procrastinated on this class and should have taken it right after 213, but c'est la vie. This class gets a pretty bad wrap, but it is not that difficult. The pre-assessment is not really indicative of the OA in my opinion. I would learn how to use the calculator first and then go ahead and take the pre-assessment. There is a great calculator overview video in the class resources section and an excel document that takes you step by step keystrokes for the common problems. Once you do that, study the Pre-OA to make sure you can schedule your exam (a few of the questions will be on the OA, but not many). Once you feel comfy with the math &amp; pre-OA - learn the 222 questions quizlet backwards and forwards - this is the bulk of the OA.\\n\\nI signed-up for a free Quizlet+ trial in order to use the “Learn” feature for the entire thing. This will take you through the questions again and again until you’ve got them down. After you do that, schedule your exam. I then generated a 100-quesiton test on quizlet and practiced the math (PV, FV, and especially Bond equations) using your BAII Plus. Outside of those equations you have a formula sheet which can help you figure out the other math and some of the questions on the OA. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C216 – MBA Capstone\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1 PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 paper and 1 portfolio (resume, summary of competencies learned, LinkedIn profile, career/edu examples).\\n\\nBelieve it or not I attended a business camp in high school (I know I am so cool). We spent the week doing a business simulation where we produced a product (I think mp3 players?). Really the only difference is we got to do the task as a group and submitted paper decisions (vintage). They weren’t lying, it was college level, because three years later I did it for my bachelor's capstone (I can’t remember what the product was for this one, but that was group thing too) and now here we are again but this time...you're on your own, kid. Make sure you read the industry news/memos, stick to your plan, anticipate needs/demands - you will be fine. I suggest really investing in fixed capacity and the follow-up study findings.\\n\\nTask 1 is a recap of where you are at halfway through and asking for 2.5 million in VC money. After you complete the first few quarters, you will fill out the tactical plan in QA4 which is just educated guesses for what will happen in the next three quarters. Make sure you fill that out and download it before submitting Q4. The presentation is pretty simple, make sure you use their template and read the notes section, you can also check out YouTube for a few example presentations. After you have recorded your video, submit task one (link to video, PPT file, and the tactical plan). Once you submit the task then you can submit Q4 in the sim (everything should already be filled out) - then you have to wait until the task passes for Q5 to get unlocked. While you wait, I suggest working on task 3. You need to collect some materials and identify three competencies from the other courses you used for the simulation and will use in the future. Work on it but don't submit it until you’ve submitted task 2.\\n\\nOnce you get approval on task 1 you can go back to the simulation and finish up the rest, you only need a total score of .001 so it’s totally doable and goes much faster this time if you put in work the first few quarters. Once you finish up the simulation you can get to work on the paper. Mine ended up being super long because of the enormous number of screenshots - the write-up itself is not too bad, but make sure you do it either as you make decisions or right after you finish the sim. I used the capstone Facebook group a lot for templates/outlines/questions to make sure I was addressing everything correctly. As always, follow the rubric and you will be a-okay. Make sure to download the required CBS and CCS files and submit those along with your paper.\\n\\nAfter you have submitted Task 2 you can submit task 3, make sure all of your artifacts have your name on them - mine came back for revisions because they couldn’t “attribute” it to me.\\n\\nAfter that you wait and wait and wait for the grades and then woot, you did it! (5 Days)\\n\\n# Overall Thoughts\\n\\nI think this program is great, when I compare it to the program I did for my undergrad at a traditional university…it just cuts out so much red tape. I literally could not imagine having to go back to 3 classes a quarter, multiple lectures a week, and having to wait years to finish a degree. But there is a certain magic that you get through a traditional program too especially if you're young. You really just have to weigh out the pros and cons of each.\\n\\nI think the MBA program is especially useful for folks who don’t have an undergraduate degree in business. As I understand it, that is the original purpose of a master's degree - to learn something new, different from your undergrad education. This program gives you all the information of a business degree, without any fluff.\\n\\nI obviously have my undergrad degree in Business, but I was mainly looking to check a box for senior &amp; teaching roles going into it. I did end up enjoying being able to apply my corporate experience to material that was familiar to me - I had a few ah-ha moments throughout the program. I think folks getting a BA in business from WGU (or any institution) and then immediately getting the MBA are doing themselves a disservice. Without time in between It really is just a summary of the BA program with a slight-managerial focus. If you’re just trying to check a box for whatever reason though, then more power to you.\\n\\nIf you want to branch out more for your next degree and have a business undergrad, I would wait until you have few years under your belt or get a master’s degree in a different or related field (MA or MS in IT or Marketing Analytics) these can offer certifications or hard skills that you can market to employers.\\n\\nThe MBA courses are all very manageable, the ones that took me the longest were C206, C212, and C207; those were purely due to fatigue &amp; mental blocks. My favorite courses were C204 because I was able to apply a ton of my work experience to those assignments and C216 because I am a dork, and the simulation was really fun and truly a way to flex every concept you studied at once.\\n\\nOverall, I think programs like WGU are the future of education and would recommend this school to anyone, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into and think you can work through the program yourself - you can do it!</td>\n",

       "      <td>D287: some starter tips to get you going on a project about the weirdest shop ever...\\nHi everyone,\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI just finished D287 and wanted to add some pointers for starting out before the project (just getting your bearings and learning the basics and stuff), as well as to try and clarify some things in the project instructions that I found to be not very clear. There are other guides that cover how to tackle each of the steps, so I don't go into that stuff. Instead, I just include some starting-out resources and then explain the parts I found to be ambiguous and try to give you some sense of what I think they might have meant.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDisclaimer: My brain picks apart the meaning of words without me even trying. I tend to think of all the ways an instruction (or OA test question...) might be interpreted and end up getting caught up trying to figure out exactly what they meant. So, it is possible that the things I found confusing about this PA were not that confusing to anyone else. But in case anyone else gets confused by imprecise wording, hopefully something here will help.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**BEGINNER STUFF BEFORE YOU DO THE PA THAT MIGHT HELP:**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI had no idea what Spring was, or what a \"framework\" was, before this course. You'll see terms thrown around like \"dependency injection\" or \"inversion of control,\" but you don't really need to know the definition of those terms yet. You can just learn how Spring works and then later on, it will probably be easier to learn those terms because then you can say, oh, that's what this thing is called. Learning them first might just end up being confusing.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nMy best beginner's explanation of Spring is this: there is a boatload of code that ends up being involved in doing something like making a functional website that links to a database and has info on stuff in your database and basically keeps your data secure and does everything else you need it to do. And a while ago, some people decided to basically write some generic code to do this stuff that you could just download and link to in your own code and it would do a lot of the work for you. (Sort of like if you end up writing the same email for a job or school once a week, you might end up copying and pasting the beginning of the email that stays the same every time, right? And you could save your stock email opening to a keyboard shortcut and then use that instead, and it would be less typing for you, yay!) But then over time, people got so happy at how much less work this was for them, that they kept adding more and more stuff. So then there was this awesome set of code you could customize and pick and choose bits from and use and it would make what once was a ton of work into a lot less work. But....because people have been adding to this thing for years and making it super functional and cool, it actually now has so much stuff that it can be overwhelming to learn all the things it can do.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nImagine if you had to go to the store and it was really far away and all you knew how to do was walk. But then someone was like \"oh here's this thing called a tricked-out SUV with awesome rims that shoots lasers at pedestrians,\" but you didn't know what any of those things were because all you knew was how to walk. So it would def get you to the store faster...but you'd still need to learn what a car was and what all those words meant and how to drive the car and operate the lasers and stereo (stereo? what's a stereo?) and all that jazz. So, in this example, Spring is the tricked-out SUV with awesome rims that shoots lasers at pedestrians, and you're the poor schlub who's out here trying to walk 27 miles to the store.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSoooo for the course material, I tried reading that book they link in the first chapter and it was super overwhelming. Ultimately, I tried a couple of courses on Udemy until found one I really liked: [\"Learn Spring Boot 3 in 100 Steps\"](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-tutorial-for-beginners/). It is available through your free WGU Udemy subscription ([https://wgu.udemy.com/](https://wgu.udemy.com/)). The reason I liked this course instead of some of the other ones is that it walks you through everything slowly and takes a one step at a time approach. Like, you start by making a Spring app that just....prints some text to a webpage locally on your computer, using Spring (so entirely through the backend with no html page). Then you do a tiny bit more, and then a tiny bit more, so that you're not overwhelmed with a barrage of info all at once. And also, there is a lot in here that relates to this project and also to the next project as well. (You end up creating some things that are the same kind of things as some of the stuff created for you in the project, which makes it easier to understand how to use those things, if that makes sense? Like you'll create a repository and a service, and both of those are in the project.) So if you're feeling a bit lost, def give this course a try. It really, really helped Spring feel less intimidating. One note: the project uses Thymeleaf and the course uses something called JSP files. I ended up doing my stuff in Thymeleaf and just googling \"Thymeleaf equivalent of JSP XYZ\" when needed. For example, for both, there is a specific place you need to put the files (aka you need to name your folder something specific and put it in a certain spot). The instructor will explain where the JSP place is and if you just google \"where do Thymeleaf files need to be in Spring,\" you'll find the equivalent place (or just look at the 287 project because it's the same).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, IMHO, there is one part of this course where you add Spring Security to your project that I felt explained the gist of Spring really well...basically you do very, very little and suddenly you have this at least semi-secure login page that blocks you from accessing any of the pages in the app until you enter the right id and password. You don't need to know this for the 287 project, it's just cool how little you have to do to get this thing working. It's like you download one thing and maybe write something up to store your username and password and bam, instant login. That is what made it really hit home for me what this whole Spring thing was about.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor Java stuff, I don't know how much new stuff you really need to learn, but there's some in the book if you want. I tried reading the book but then I found this YouTube page, [Coding with John](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithJohn/videos?app=desktop), that has some good videos on specific Java concepts and is less boring than the book (the Java part of the book (chapters 2 onward) isn't terrible though or anything). The one on generics is pretty cool and is done well, and I ended up watching a bunch of other ones too (not necessary for the course but I wanted to learn it). The Hashset one is good and might be helpful for this project.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**STUFF IN THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WAS CONFUSING THAT HOPEFULLY I CAN NOW CLARIFY:**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe PA has you making a backend for the weirdest shop ever. Apparently, they want a webpage where customers can go and read about the products and buy the products, and also mess around with their internal inventory and product names and parts. So you could go visit this shop, buy something, then go in and edit the products to add a new product called \"a brand new, hot pink Maserati,\" and set the price at $1, and buy that, too. And then you could delete their entire inventory from their database just for fun. But hey, what the customer wants, the customer gets, right?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIf you read the entire project first before starting anything, and are wondering where the \"update\" and \"delete\" buttons are, don't panic. They will only appear when there are products and parts in the tables.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFYI: IntelliJ will always find errors and warn you before pushing. I bet you could go in and add a single space to a single file and it would tell you that you had 14 errors and make you confirm again that you wanted to push. So don't sweat this. Also, if you amend your commit to include your own comment and delete IntelliJ's default commit message, for some reason it will just commit both. Like each commit of mine is one commit with my message and another with IntelliJ's stock message. My \"similarity score\" for my history file was like 80%, so I don't think I'm the only one who had a file full of the same default message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Part B: how detailed does the README file have to be?**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI wondered if I was going to get dinged if I didn't detail every single possible change to every single line in excruciating detail, but practically speaking doing a literal line by line log seemed like a bit too much. I did write a lot, but I wrote most of my changes in groups. I would group the lines related to the change, like if I wrote a method in a class, I'd just put lines 25-30 for the method. I did have a LOT of style changes to the HTML files and I broke those down in a bit more detail, but still grouped them by category (like \"changed layout of main page using CSS grid and moved these two sections next to each other\"). I just sort of used my judgment and tried to balance meeting the requirement of detailing changes by line with not making the evaluator's eyes bleed.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I would go back during later steps and change things again that were technically part of earlier steps, I did put those changes in the readme under the earlier step, but I just said \"went back during a later step and changed the background,\" etc. (As you can see, I can write a lot, so I was not too worried about being dinged for not writing enough. Mostly I just tried to keep everything brief but make sure I included enough chunks with detailed changes to show I was being diligent. Some parts were much more detailed than others.)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nDid you know...? IntelliJ will highlight files with changes in them before a commit, and inside the file it will mark the changed lines on one side. So if you see a highlighted file but don't want to commit any changes to that file (maybe you added a line of whitespace or something), go back into that file and hit CTRL Z to undo changes until the file name isn't highlighted anymore.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Part C: the HTML interface**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI like messing with webpage style so I took this literally and went to town. But, as instructed, I did not delete a single element. I commented out the bootstrap link (hey, it's not an \"element,\" so bye bye bootstrap), but otherwise left all of their actual elements on the page. I just created my own divs and classes around them. I also changed some of the bootstrap classes they had put in their elements to my own class names. I did move the layout of the products and parts tables to be next to each other instead of stacked, centered everything, etc., and it was all fine. You don't have to do this, I just did it because I find that stuff fun.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe instructions say that the page should include the product names and parts....does adding them to the tables count? Because then they're in the tables and displayed on the page...but it said to \"add the names to the page,\" not add the products to the table. I originally just added them to the table and thought that was fine because the page was already cluttered enough. The instructor demo project (if you notice) only has them in the table and does not have them listed separately, so it's probably fine. However, if you delete your products and parts entirely, then the product names and part names aren't there anymore, so I ended up going back later on and adding the product and part names to the top on either side of the shop name just to be safe.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBUT.....the document they give you with the task says something about Outsourced Parts and Inhouse Parts...do you have to indicate which is which on the page? There will be more on this later but for Part C, you can just put the name of the part without regard for outsourced or inhouse anything.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Part D: How much is required?**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis one is pretty self explanatory. The instructor demo version has a single line of text but I actually think they want a little more than that. I had fun and made a whole silly page with a little story and all, but I think you just have to have something describing your company. In my evaluation report there was a line that said something like \"the About page describes the company,\" so might as well throw a few lines in there just saying what the company sells and all.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Part E: Why doesn't it tell you how many parts have to be outsourced/inhouse???**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis step is not that clear. You're supposed to add five products and five parts, but it says nothing about outsourced or inhouse parts. Does it mean five outsourced *and* five inhouse? Five total from one or the other, or a combination of both? I ended up making 3 of one kind and 2 of another, and I passed, but I have no idea what they actually want here. I think if you at least have one of each and five total, you're probably fine. I have no idea if you can do more than 5. As far as this whole \"don't overwrite existing data in the database\" thing, I don't know what that means because later in the same step, it says you're only supposed to add your sample inventory when \\*both\\* the product and part tables are empty. AKA only when there are no products and no parts in inventory. So what would you be writing over? I assume this is just some kind of redundancy meant to enforce the rule about only putting products and parts in when everything is empty, idk. I assume if you just follow this step like the other guides have spelled out, it should be fine.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRegarding the \"multi-pack\" thing...basically your products have to be made up of your parts (don't over think this, it's fine if you had like a bicycle and your parts were wheels and a seat...obviously a bike has more than that in it). And if you want one product, their app is not set up to let you add multiple copies of a part to a product (you can \"associate\" parts to products using their product form). So instead, if your product needs two wheels, just make the wheel part be \"set of two wheels.\" If you also sell a unicycle, then they just get an extra wheel as a spare.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Part F: The buy now message**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe one thing I'll touch on here is that message indicating success or failure. What kind of message? Do they want a pop up? A message on the page itself? A separate page? I don't know. What I do know is that for their own \"delete part\" confirmation message, they made a separate page that it will divert you to after you delete a part. You can view the html file for this page in the project. They also made their page immediately go back to the main page with no delay, so when you delete a product it's kind of a blink-and-you'll-miss-it message. So....if that's sufficient for the delete part, then it should be sufficient for the buy now message. So I made two separate HTMLs, one for success and one for failure, and just routed to either of those after the buynow was clicked. I did go and look up some simple javascript to set a brief delay before going back to the other page instead of the instantaneous reroute so you could actually read the message, but I don't think that was necessary. And that part passed so I imagine just using the same thing they did would work as well. You could probably pass by displaying the message another way if you feel comfortable with that.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAs far as that little line about not decreasing the inventory of the associated parts....what? Notice they never told you that your sample inventory needed to have parts associated with it...there is a way to do that via their web forms but what if your sample inventory is populated from the command line runner? Do you need to find a way to associate parts to products then? I do not know if you do, but I went ahead and did this. The only thing I would note is that the id I set for my parts and products would be overwritten when the parts and products were saved to the repository (not when creating them, only when using [repository.save](https://repository.save)(product/part). If you look at part and product, you'll see a \"generated value\" annotation on the id field, and I think what that does is, when the product/part is actually saved to the database, it auto generates an id. So then if you try to find by id after saving to the repository, the id might not be the same (at least, it wasn't for me). I don't even know if this is required, but I ended up writing some long code that broke this down into steps, so that I would first save all my products and parts, then access the repository and do a for loop checking if the product/part name .equals() and then getting the id for each product/part that way, and then going back and adding a set of parts to each product and products to each part, and resaving all to the repo.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis was not super difficult, but it was long. There is probably a much easier and shorter way to do it, but at that point I just wanted to not have any more errors pop in so I did it the long way. I have not seen this in other guides so I don't know if it's necessary at all to even do this. But, when I was done and deleted everything from the website in order to make the sample inventory populate, it did populate with the associated parts. And then....turns out I didn't have to do anything to make sure the buy now button didn't decrement the associated parts because why would it? Their code is written to decrement parts when adding more of a product, not when removing a product (like when buying it).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nOne thing to note: to test out the code I did end up deleting everything and having it repopulate many times while working on the project. (They will test your code with nothing in the database to make sure your sample inventory populates when evaluating it.) So, I would test the functions with everything there and then delete it all, rerun the program and see how it acted when repopulating everything over and over again. So, even if you're not required to put the associated parts with the products in the sample inventory, it did make it easier than having to go through and re add them each time.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Parts G and H: how many ways can you validate the same thing?**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe last line of G seems like it's part of the same thing as Part H. You're \"enforcing\" your new fields within the code and then also validating them? What? Isn't the code already validated by virtue of it being enforced? Like if the person can't add inventory outside of the min max range, then they can't add it. This is confusing. I think what they want by \"enforcement\" is the code not allowing a person to add inventory outside the range, and by \"validation\" is to basically do something that enforces it again but also displays a message. I couldn't figure out if the message had to be done using a validator, or if using Thymeleaf (you can use an if statement in Thymeleaf to display a message if a condition is met) was fine. I did it through Thymeleaf first and later got worried that by \"validation\" they might have meant \"write a class for a Validator,\" so I did both.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Part J: what are you actually supposed to delete?**\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThis is explained in another post, but one thing I didn't know was whether they wanted the class file only deleted or the class file + the corresponding interface (each validator has two files). After all, an interface is still a class file...but then again, the interface had some \"usages\" marked in IntelliJ, so that would mean having to go through and delete those usages, but it didn't say to delete those....so I just deleted the one file and left it's lonely little interface there and apparently that was fine.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHopefully this is helpful...if anyone else is stuck on some instruction that seems confusing or ambiguous, I can try to help. I am sure there were a lot more things that I forgot to include that I found confusing about this project.</td>\n",

I owe a ton of thanks to this community for providing assistance at various points, so this is my attempt to give back by writing a comprehensive guide to what I did. \\n\\n**TLDR:**\\n\\n1. 1 month planning/prep, 2-3 months of Sophia, 1-2 month study.com (SDC), 1 month prep, than 6 months WGU.\\n2. Prep = pre-study Java, Discrete Math, Linux, Networking/Security, maybe Version Control before starting to maximize your paid time.\\n3. Once enrolled at WGU, Get with your mentor ASAP about your plans to accelerate; you don't want to waste study time waiting on them to add more courses to your plan.\\n4. For project classes, submit tasks at 70% quality level and let evaluators guide you on what to improve (submit early, submit often!) Usually, it's best to  go straight to the tasks, referring back to the course material or Google if you have questions.\\n5. For test classes, take PA FIRST (don't look at/write down answers, just focus on question format and overall strong/weak points) then focus your studying around understanding PA questions, then retake the PA. Answers are a trap; don't look at them. 80% PA level is probably good enough.\\n6. Don't sweat the details too much. The order you take classes at WGU, which classes to take at SDC, what % you need on OA's before taking a PA...not that big a deal. As long as you are consistently working tasks or studying for OA's daily, you're fine.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\nI think it's important you know my background, so you can see if this plan works for you. I'm an IT manager in my late 30's who's been working in government IT jobs for a decade+. I was able to fly through the IT portions of the degree and/or get transfer credit, but felt reasonably challenged by the CS portions that were new and wholly unfamiliar. Calibrate accordingly.\\n\\n**Why you should NOT accelerate:**\\n\\n* First, understand what you are sacrificing if you plan to complete in one term. While WGU has much less \"fluff\" compared to a more traditional online degree, it's still a lot of work. You will have to be very focused and that's not very fun when you really want to do stuff with your kids, or just binge watch Succession, etc. Burnout is real, and there were days I definitely regretted doing this.\\n* Second, let's be real - if you do this, you're not going to remember most of it. That said, I took four years to get my bachelor's (in a non-technical field), and I don't remember most of that, either. If you're expecting to actually learn CS to anything more than basic familiarity, that's going to take either work experience or additional self-study above and beyond WGU's materials. My personal opinion is 1 year accelerated WGU + 3 years of Leetcode/projects/interviewing/etc. will prep you for a CS job WAY better than 4 years of traditional CS schooling, but I think reasonable people can disagree on this point.\\n\\nWith that, let's get to the guide.\\n\\n**General Tips:**\\n\\nFor every course, follow these steps.\\n\\n1. Search Reddit for the specific course number; someone has likely written up a guide.\\n2. Click through the \"Course Tips\" and \"Course Search\" on the right hand side of the Course Page, and read things linked there- there's usually something helpful posted there that isn't officially posted in the announcements. \"Course Chatter\" can also have some gems occasionally.\\n3. Join the relevant channel on the WGU CS Discord and look for any pinned posts or guides that people have linked.\\n4. For OA courses, take the PA FIRST as a pre-test, as there's nothing worse than studying the textbook for a couple weeks and realizing that it's not relevant or way too in-depth, etc. DON\"T look at the answers when complete; just get a feel for the questions and what you're expected to know. Once you do that, THEN go study with that in mind. (I prefer reading textbooks to Youtube videos, but there are plenty of video alternatives out there for all this stuff if you'd rather. Keep in mind that you have to actually pay attention to the video and not just have it in the background while you focus on finding lethal in Hearthstone.) When you think you've got it, take the PA again, This time, you can look at the answers, but look at ALL of them. The important thing is the process; if you guessed and got it right, that's bad from a PA perspective, so review anything that you didn't know cold. Repeat until you're about 80% confident, then take the OA. (100% confidence will take time you don't have.) \\n5. For task-based courses, start with the actual tasks. (I found it helpful to print out the Task Overview so I could have it nearby when studying - you want to make sure you're studying something that's actually a task.) When doing the tasks, you want to follow the requirements outline EXACTLY; it's super boring and repetitive, but each requirement section gets evaluated independently so you want to make it easy to the evaluator to check the box and move on. Finally, a lot of the requirements are vague. It's tempting to add dozens of extra pages of detail to cover every contingency, or ask the CI's to clarify (they won't); fight that temptation, just give it your best guess and submit. Either you're right, or you're you can adjust based on the evaluator's feedback. You have unlimited submissions! Use them. I would say about 50% of my tasks were first-time completes, and 95% were completed after one revision. (Note that some evaluators will force you to talk to a CI before resubmitting; this happened to me twice, and both times a quick email to the CI unlocked it within a day.)\\n\\n**Month 1 - Prep**\\n\\nPlan, plan, plan. Write out a list of all the courses in the major and how you plan to get credit for them. (This list is a good [starting point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/12xwwnc/updated_bscs_curriculum_and_credit_transfer_from/)) I had a spreadsheet listing each course and my plan for getting credit for it.\\n\\nOnce you have a plan, start talking to WGU about a projected start date. You can change it up until you finish Orientation, so feel free to push it back if life happens. Get an initial transfer eval (if you have prior college or certs to transfer in). Do this ASAP - you want to know early what you got credit for and what you didn't to plan what things you need to take/not take.\\n\\nPre-Study: This is critical to the plan. I recommend pre-studying the following topics when time allows before committing to WGU.\\n\\n* Java: I used the [r/learnjava](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/) recommended [Java Programming course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) from the University of Helsinki. Try to do a little each day; there's a lot of exercises, but you need the practice for it to become second nature.\\n* Discrete Math: I used this [free Discrete Math textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/) from Oscar Levin.\\n* Linux: The Linux Foundations textbook [is freely available](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/010-160/) and is the same material used on the test.\\n* Networking/Security: I didn't need this given my background, but if you do [Professor Messer](https://www.professormesser.com/) has some great free resources.\\n* Version Control: Tons of free resources one Google away, but GitHub's [official tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) is quick and all you need.\\n\\n**Month 2-3 - Sophia**\\n\\n[Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) (non-referral link) is great, and where you want to take the vast majority of your transfer courses. It has three key redeeming features. First, it's cheap at $100/month. Second, the tests are open-book. Third, it's a good barometer. If you can knock out the Sophia courses in 1-2 months, then you have the ability to successfully complete the accelerated schedule. If not, then you  need to allow yourself more time (which is something you want to know early before you start spending the bigger $).\\n\\n*How to Sophia:*\\n\\nThe [Student Guide](https://www.sophia.org/content/dam/sophia/sophia-guide-and-syllabus/sophia-student-guide.pdf) sums it up well, but each course is a mix of Challenges, Milestones, and Touchstones. Challenges are 3-5 question multiple-choice quizzes, with two attempts at each question; these are straightforward. Milestones are longer timed tests. For these, I recommend having the practice Milestone and the course open in separate tabs; this is explicitly allowed, and makes it much easier to reference formulas or methods for solving problems. Touchstones are projects, and vary in difficulty.\\n\\nKey point to remember is that you can only have two classes open at a time, so ideally you want to start a class, do all the Challenges and Milestones, submit all the Touchstones, then start on your second class while the first Touchstones are being graded. (If you're super fast and have two classes blocked and waiting on Touchstones, supposedly chat support will open a third class for you.)\\n\\nI can't speak to the general education classes as I had transfer credit for those, but for the rest:\\n\\n* Intro to IT / Intro to Web Dev - two very simple and straightforward courses that should take no more than a day each.\\n* Intro to Python Programming / Intro to Java Programming - while I don't think these courses are very good at teaching Java or Python, they're a much easier way to get credit than the respective WGU course. If you've taken a programming course before (or the Helsinki course), these will be easy. I recommend taking both as you'll need to know some Python for WGU DSA2, and you MAY (not guaranteed) get credit for both SP - Foundations and SP - Applications. You really want credit for both as Applications is pretty tough at WGU.\\n* Intro to Relational Databases - this course is pretty long and dry, but a decent primer for SQL and a good measure of difficulty. You can Google-force your way through the other courses, but not so much this one. Keep in mind there's no project for this one so I'd work on it while waiting for your Java or Python project to be graded.\\n* Calculus - The \"toughest,\" though not that tough if all you care about is passing. The instruction isn't the greatest so use Khan Academy or similar sources if you're stuck on how to solve things.\\n\\n**Month 4-5 - Study.com** (SDC)\\n\\nSDC is overrated, IMO. It's Sophia with maybe slightly better course quality, a much worse interface, and 2-3x the cost/time due to a frankly insane number of quizzes that are all mandatory. (For comparison's sake: Sophia Calculus has 105 quiz questions, broken into 21 quizzes, and 130 test questions broken into six tests. SDC Calculus has over 500 quiz questions, plus a 50 question test.)\\n\\nWhy are we here? There's a few WGU courses that can ONLY be done at SDC, and SDC courses are easier than WGU courses to pass as the quizzes count toward your final grade.\\n\\n*How to SDC:*\\n\\n1. Once you've signed up for a class, take the \"placement test\" first. This will give you credit for some of the quizzes. You can retake the placement test and get a little more credit for missed questions.\\n2. For each \"section,\" open the quiz in one tab and keep the material open in the other. If you don't 100% a quiz, retake it in another tab so you can refer back to the correct/incorrect answers. (Some people do the quizzes on their phone.)\\n3. Once done with all the quizzes, do the (typically simple) project if the course has one, take a practice exam, then schedule the \"proctored\" exam.\\n4. Note that it can take a week or more for exams/projects to be graded, so you want to be completely done with SDC by the middle of month 5, to allow them to get you the grades back in time to submit to WGU.\\n\\n*What to take at SDC:*\\n\\n* Data Management - Applications / Advanced Data Management: These two courses on SDC have overlapping quizzes, so that relieves some of the tedium, and the equivalent WGU courses are somewhat challenging. (This assumes you took Intro to Relational Databases at Sophia; if not you'll want to also take the Data Management - Foundations at SDC.)\\n* Discrete Math 1: Either way, this is tough to learn, but the SDC test is significantly easier. (I took it at WGU, which I regret as the Zybook wasn't very good and I ended up using outside materials.)\\n* Data Structures and Algorithms I: Like DM1, the DSA1 test is easier. You definitely want to have the Java prep done before you do this.\\n\\n*What to not take at SDC:*\\n\\n* Artificial Intelligence: People say take AI at SDC due to the AI course at WGU having a monster third project - what they're missing is that you can use the monster third project as your capstone project also, with a little extra work.\\n* Computer Architecture: The WGU CA exam is pretty difficult, but the projects at SDC are VERY time-consuming. Plus, the WGU CA material duplicates over to Operating Systems.\\n* Fundamentals of Information Security: I had credit for this so didn't take it at WGU, but from a glance through the curriculum it looks VERY similar to D315.\\n* Anything you can take at Sophia, obvs.\\n\\n**Month 6 - Final Prep**\\n\\n* Make SURE your final transfer credit eval is right; once you start you can't go back.\\n* Keep doing Prep. If you have extra time, look at MIT's \"[Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)\"; some quick lectures on a lot of beginner-level topics that CS courses don't teach well.\\n\\n**Month 7-12: WGU**\\n\\nIt's go time! I've grouped courses into a rough recommended order and time recommendations, but there's no hard prerequisites so don't freak out if your mentor wants to do something different. Get on their good side, btw; typically mentors are going to be resistant to acceleration plans until you demonstrate you can knock our the first set of classes, so don't push it too hard.\\n\\nEdit: [u/katrinars\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/katrinars_/) has a ton of great walkthroughs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT2YfYBaoU9Jxh0hj9ytbYvGUL7FAWN7wzyWOk6JCsErmGib4_qbBkEhz1sE-_Bqx1e1v349GOx41DA/pub), highly recommended and I wish I had known about these when I was doing the classes.\\n\\nIT Classes (4 weeks):\\n\\n* D197 Version Control - Simple and quick, but vital to know for future projects. Knocking this out &lt;1 week will help your mentor know you're serious about accelerating.\\n* D281 Linux Foundations -If you pre-studied, this can be a week 1 completion; if not, can be done in a week.\\n* D315 Network and Security Foundations - it's tough for me to assess the difficulty of this class since this is what I do in my day job (WGU wouldn't take my certs because they were over 5 years old...even though I have to pay an AMF and do CE's...grumble). This will probably take 1-2 weeks of study if you have no familiarity with IT and didn't do the prep. If you need D430 (Fundamentals of Information Security), take it right after D315 as the material is very similar.\\n* D336 Business of IT - Ugh, this class sucks. The material is mind-numbing memorization, but thankfully there's not that much of it. The worst part is the Axelos software you have to install for the test is some of the shittiest software I've ever seen. I think I spent more time trying to get the test software working than I did actually studying the material. Give yourself PLENTY of time on test day for this one.\\n\\nMath Classes (4 weeks):\\n\\n* C960 Discrete Mathematics 2: There's not a lot of guiding I can do here, unfortunately; you really have to read the textbook and learn how to do the problems. Hopefully you did DM1 at SDC, which is much easier. I didn't and ended up taking six weeks total for both, including a \"fresh start\" where I dug up the other Discrete Math book linked above that helped me finally \"get it.\"  You can supplement with [Youtube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxersk8fUxiUMSIx0DBqsKZS) if that helps, too.\\n\\nCoding Classes (6 weeks):\\n\\n* D286 Java Fundamentals - If you did the Java prep course, this will be a snap - you can skip right to the PA. Note that this PA/OA is different than the others as it's the only one to have an actual coding environment; as such, you'll want to take this PA several times, each time focusing on a few of the coding questions, to make sure you're comfortable coding in the given environment.\\n* D287 Java Frameworks - This course is where things get real. Forget most of the Java you just learned; this is actually a frameworks/design patterns/MVC course. That's a good idea, but the curriculum is basically \"go watch this Udemy video,\" so I bounced off it and tried to just Google my way through the tasks. This is a BAD idea because there are tons of fiddly little bits between your IDE, Maven, Spring Boot, and Java that all have to be in sync for things to work right, and Googling isn't going to help you understand which specific fiddly bit is wrong. Take some time here and build a Spring Boot-powered website from scratch so you understand what the annotations are actually doing.\\n* D288 Back-End Programming - All the fiddly bits of D287, but now \"do it in a virtual environment for no real good reason,\" and \"let's add SQL and Angular fiddly bits on top of the existing fiddly bits.\" This is where tiny mistakes will sink you for days so triple-check spellings on things.\\n* D387 Advanced Java - If you made it through D287/D288, this is pretty easy in comparison. The \"advanced\" stuff you have to learn here isn't really all that advanced, and the tasks are much more straightforward compared to the other two classes.\\n\\nDesign and Theory Classes (6 weeks)\\n\\n* D284/D480 Software Engineering/ Software Design+QA - If you need a break from coding, you'll get it here. These two classes are all writing assignments where you get to take some information about requirements and then design or engineer a solution. The Design one is faintly ridiculous as you have to create two multi-page documents to explain what is effectively a one-line code fix, so put on your pretend bureaucrat hat.\\n* C952 Computer Architecture - This class gets some hate, which I don't understand. It's definitely a lot of vocab, but this is all pretty key stuff. Overall this felt similar in quality to other college-level Computer Arch courses. Use the Lusby webinars as a guide to what to focus your reading on.\\n* C151 Operating Systems - Not as \"high-level abstract\" as Computer Architecture, but not very low-level either, so in-between? Anyway, I breezed through this class, but my IT background definitely helped me here. It relooks a lot of material from Computer Arch so definitely take that first.\\n\\nAlgorithms/AI/Capstone (4 weeks)\\n\\n* C950 Data Structures and Algorithms 2 - like many of the WGU courses, this class isn't really about algorithms and is really a \"mini-capstone coding project\" in disguise. The \"program a hash table from scratch\" part of the task is very straightforward and will take a couple lines of code; the \"use it to deliver all these packages\" will take many more lines and will stretch your coding ability.\\n* C951/C964 Artificial Intelligence / Capstone - The \"AI\" course is really just a grab bag of stuff. Two tasks are pretty easy; the first has you writing some basic scripting code for a chatbot, and the second has you tweaking some existing computer vision code (follow the Course Tips!). The third task of AI is to design an ML project. If you peek ahead to the Capstone, you'll see that the task there is to execute an ML project, so you can absolutely use one project to accomplish both tasks.\\n\\nThat's it! Remember to ask questions on the Discord, or feel free to DM me and I'll try to help as my MS coursework allows.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How I completed my MBA in 42 days! (Acceleration Guide)\\nThis post is about my experience in WGU’s MBA program. I completed the program in 42 days, starting on December 1st, 2021. I’ve modeled this post on two other posts that helped me immensely, and I probably wouldn’t have been able to accelerate this much if it wasn’t for them, so please show them love. \\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/ot0usb/wgu\\_mba\\_the\\_sort\\_of\\_accelerated\\_adventure/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/ot0usb/wgu_mba_the_sort_of_accelerated_adventure/)\\n\\nAbout me: I completed my BSBA from WGU in 4.5 months last year, so I am no stranger to accelerating. The format for the MBA program is almost 100% similar, but the expectations and workload are higher. During this time, I technically worked full time, but I used a TON of vacation days so that I could focus on school. I only worked 2 days a week for 5 weeks and concentrated 100% on school in between holiday events and family/social obligations. I also started to feel sick during the capstone (unbeknownst to me at the time it was covid setting in) but I managed to complete everything. When I started this program, I wanted to complete it by the semester end date, but then I saw that there would be a physical commencement in my city in a few months, but I had to be done sooner than the semester end date. This gave me a deadline of 4 months, and when I started, I allocated myself 10 days per class to meet this deadline. \\n\\nSome quick tips:\\n\\n1. Prepare for your upcoming class. Read about it on reddit, get other’s opinions on it. Know what is necessary to complete and what isn’t. A lot of classes have a lot of supplemental material, if you want to read it all go ahead. I wanted to focus on course specific material and meet my deadline. If you’re looking to accelerate, then it doesn’t help you to go into classes blind. You might find that you may be able to test out of certain classes early due to work experience or be pointed in a direction with more helpful resources.  \\n\\n2. STICK.TO.THE.RUBRIC. Enough said. This applies to ALL WGU classes with papers. Ignore paper length recommendations. Answer the prompt and move on. You’re not getting bonus points for writing books. Speaking of papers, the MBA program provides you a really good business paper template early on. SAVE THIS TEMPLATE. I used this template for ALL my papers. I will probably use it in my career for professional reports. IT IS THAT GOOD. Learn how to use Word’s “Manage Sources” feature in the References menu. This makes citing sources a breeze (I started using this in my BSBA). \\n\\n3. Get a business calculator. I used the TI BAII Plus. LEARN THE CALCULATOR. When I started this, I was under the assumption that there would be minimal math like in the BSBA. I was wrong. There is a class that you will be miserable in if you do not learn the business calculator. You may be able to get by with a regular calculator, but I honestly don’t see how unless you’re some sort of math genius. That class is hard enough, you don’t need to add stress to it by trying to figure out calculator work arounds. The calculator is about $30 USD. Just spend the money. You’re working on an MBA; you’ll see the return on investment. \\n\\n4. Check the course resources. A lot of classes have really good instructor provided resources and videos. If you’re stuck, look here. I found myself just jumping there upon starting a class, before even reading the material. Some of these resources are more helpful than the textbook. \\n\\nThe classes are listed in the order I took them:\\n\\n**C200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People** – Pretty easy, sort of tedious. Wow, 2 papers right off the bat. Ok then. So, there was not much reading material in this class, you literally jump in and start writing. If you’re a recent graduate this will be easy, just a warmup. If it’s been a while you may have to shake the dust off. In the first task you complete a leadership evaluation. Takes about 30 minutes. Then you write a paper about your personal leadership style. In the second task you evaluate someone else’s leadership style. I submitted 2 11-page papers. Both passed first attempt. Took about 3-4 days total. \\n\\n**C202 – Managing Human Capital** – This was pretty easy. If you’re returning from WGU’s business school like I did, or work in a professional environment this should be common sense. A lot of the material is reused from the undergrad courses. I took the time to read through the 14 chapters just because I’m paranoid when it comes to multiple choice tests. I wanted to make sure I understood the terminology that would be used. Maybe this was overkill, I scored all blue bars on the assessment. This covers staffing, recruitment, retention, risk management, training and development, performance management, compensation strategies, employee benefits, and unions. Took about 2-3 days.  \\n\\n**C204 – Management Communication** – Easy, somewhat tedious. Another writing class. This was an easy class, I just found it tedious due to having to be creative. Task 1 has you writing emails, blogs, letters, and addressing customer complaints. Easy stuff but you have to imagine yourself in the role of the scenario. I do this all day long at work so it wasn’t new to me. Then you write a short paper about why you used the communication methods you used for each document. Task 2 is a PowerPoint presentation and Panopto recording. I found this easier and more enjoyable than task 1. This is exactly the same as the Panopto projects in the undergrad programs. Took about 2-3 days. \\n\\n**C212 – Marketing** – Easy but tedious, 1 long paper. I didn’t bother reading any of the material. I jumped straight into the task. You write a paper from the perspective of a company that is proposing new products or services. Just follow the rubric as you write your paper. The hardest part is coming up with the product or service, as this has to be based in reality and must be feasible. My advice, just write what you know. What services or products do you use often, and what changes would you make for that company if you could? That’s how I approached it. Then I researched what I needed and wrote it up. This class has a good task template. I used it as a rough draft, and research what I needed on another window. It also points you to sections of the textbook you’ll need to cite. I had to submit this 10-page paper twice due to missing a rubric prompt. Oops. Took about 3-4 days, but 7 days total waiting for the resubmission to clear. I had already started the next class in the meantime. \\n\\n**C213 Accounting for Decision Makers** – Medium difficulty. This class re-uses a lot of material from the undergrad course, so if you’re still fresh from that then this will be easy. There is some math in this but nothing crazy. Just basic calculations. The trick is knowing what the word problem is asking, then running the math. Study the concepts and learn how to read the basic financial statements. *I recommend you really learn this, as this will be important later.* There’s only 11 chapters in this so its easy to pick up on the main concepts and terminology. Took about 2-3 days, I finished this class while waiting for my C212 results to post. \\n\\n\\*\\*Now, I’m not sure how your degree plan is structured, but I recommend that you take C213 and C214 back-to-back. Do whatever it takes to have these classes assigned together. Beg, plead, offer your first-born, bribe (just kidding!), whatever it takes. C214 builds directly on C213 and it will make a night and day difference if you stack these. \\*\\*\\n\\n**C214 – Financial Management** – Ok, probably the first challenging class of the program, and we’re already halfway there. First thing, LEARN THE CALCULATOR. There is a video in the resources that walks you through the functions. Or look up other videos or resources but do something! Learn what all those white function buttons are for. There is a lot of math in this class! And this is one of those classes where the OA seems to not align 100% with the material or PA, so you will already be going in at a disadvantage. You can’t afford to miss easy math questions because you didn’t know how to program the calculator. All the formulas will be provided during the OA. My advice? Skim through the textbook and take quick notes. The material is really dry, but just push through, even if you’re not getting it. Just keeping reading and keep taking quick notes. There is formula after formula and example after example. Focus on concepts and terms. When you get to government regulations, REALLY study that page and how the laws apply to different sectors. Then watch the instructor videos. All 4 of them. Its about 9 hours’ worth of footage. Watch it on 1.5 or 2x speed. Get some coffee and some popcorn. (I had a vape pen and energy drink handy) As you start to go through the videos all the notes you took will ‘click’. Dr. H’s 3-part video series really explains the concepts in the course better than the textbook does. Dr. V’s bootcamp video does an excellent job in showing you how to decode the word problems and step by step calculator instructions for each one. This took me about 3 days but let me tell you it did feel like a “bootcamp” (I would know 😉). Even after all this I scored 4 blue bars and 3 green bars. I would have struggled more if it hadn’t been for the videos. \\n\\n**C211 – Global Economics for Managers** – Medium. After the back-to-back math classes I asked for this class. It was a refreshing change from all the equations. Pretty straightforward, read the textbook, learn the concepts and keywords, and study for the PA/OA. I’d say that if you’re at this level of education, you’re probably already familiar with the concepts in this class. I do not work in the financial sector in any capacity, but I still knew about FOREX concepts and stuff. Some of this might have been covered in the undergrad program. I used quizlet flashcards to supplement learning. This class took about 2 days. I did bomb one of the competencies in the test somehow (but my PA scores were all high?), but still made up for it in other areas. Who knows, a pass is a pass, might’ve still been brain fried from the math class, and the holidays were right around the corner. Whatever the case, I’ll take the 2-day pass!\\n\\n**C215 – Operations Management** – Medium/Hard. A lot of these concepts were common sense and covered in the undergrad program. Nothing new here. What’s hard is picking out the information you’ll need for the PA/OA. The way the questions are worded is tricky also. It’s one thing to understand the concept, and it’s another when you get a question that wants a very specific and technical answer. There was a lot of multiple answer questions in this, and you need to know all the aspects of what it asks. As you know from these types of tests, if you don’t select the exact 4 answers for example, you’ll get the whole question wrong. My results for this where all over the place. 2 blues, 2 greens, and 2 oranges. But I passed this class in 2 days! And I was in a rush since this was 12/24 and I had somewhere out of town I needed to be for the holidays, so I sprinted through this class. \\n\\n**C206 – Ethical Leadership** – Another easy but tedious paper class. You have to write 3 papers for this class. You should have a solid system by now when it comes to writing papers, just stick to it. I wrote a 9-, 8-, and 9-page paper, all passed first try. Took me about 4-5 days to write all these papers. Just take your time, break it up into chunks, take breaks. It might be worth taking this class early on just to get these papers out of the way. \\n\\n**C207 – Data-Driven Decision Making** – Well here it is, the world famous C207 class. The class everyone hates. The class everyone struggles with. The last class between you and the capstone. This class is easily the hardest class I’ve taken at WGU. But my opinion? It’s hard because the material isn’t very helpful, and the tasks aren’t very clear. I don’t have a statistics background, so a textbook that skims the subject doesn’t help me. And while one chapter is skimming the surface of what you need to know, the next is a deep dive into calculations I’ve never seen, understand, or have a frame of reference for. The order in which the tasks need to be submitted is another thing that gave me issues. This class has you submit task 1 before you even start to understand the material. You have to submit a business hypothesis that can be evaluated with real-world statistics. What kind of statistical evaluation methods? Who knows?! Because you haven’t understood the material yet. Everyone recommends the T-test, I do too. It is the easiest of all methods. And remember, you need 30 data points! So, whatever you’re trying to measure better have 30 sources of public data available. Or you could collect your own data, but now you’ll need to submit release forms as well with your task. Performing the calculation was the easiest part of this, explaining it via a report in task 2 was not. Task 2 needs to be answered a *very specific* way or it will be returned. I honestly thought my initial premise was flawed after I finished going through the class and was ready to work on task 2. But you have to stick to your original task 1 premise for task 2. My initial report was returned with “it is unclear whether the results are related to an analysis technique that is appropriate for the business situation”. I reached out to the course instructor who pointed me in the right direction, and after some changes to my report it passed. Perhaps this class should have you complete the material and OA before you submit a real-life scenario and analysis. Its not fun stumbling in the dark because you don’t really understand this stuff yet. To give credit where its due, there are a TON of resources for this class. It’s like everyone knows this class is very confusing, so there are PowerPoints, video presentations, printouts, all sorts of stuff for this class. I felt like I had to have someone hold my hand literally every step of these tasks. For the OA I used quizlet in learning mode to really nail the concepts and scored exemplary. Took me 6 days for this class, including the time lost to resubmitting task 2. This also occurred during New Year’s weekend, so I had other stuff going on as well. For anyone about to take this class: take a deep breath, take it slow, don’t be afraid to ask for help, reach out to your mentors or instructors, and download all the resources you’ll need. This class is the worst! But it’s a shame because it doesn’t have to be; when all said and done its not that complex, its just so poorly structured. \\n\\n**C216 – MBA Capstone –** Finally! If you’re coming from C207 like I did then this will be super easy compared to that! The capstone is a business simulation where you manage a company quarter to quarter. It is VERY similar to the simulation mid-capstone in the undergrad program. For many of you this may be the second time taking this simulation, the only difference here are the reporting requirements are more in-depth. I actually found this very fun, this is something I’d do in my free time to relax, but I like playing strategy games so to each their own. Work through your first 4 quarters, then you pause and submit a Panopto presentation to seek more capital. This will be about a 20-minute presentation, but if you follow the rubric, you’ll have enough material to present. Protip: Do not submit Q4 until you submit your presentation. You will also need to complete your tactical plan for Q5 and Q6, and if you submit Q4 before you do this, it will “lock”. Then you’ll have to do it by hand, and it WILL BE TEDIOUS. We’re talking manually editing income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, plus a LOT more for 2 quarters. Let the program do it for you, then just export it and attach it to your presentation. Once that’s approved, you’ll be allowed to complete quarters 5 and 6. Now you write a report about your company’s performance. *Remember in C213 when you really learned the financial statements? Now is the time to use that knowledge, cite your statements accordingly as you work through the report.* Answer the rubric prompts, pretty straightforward. You made all the decisions, so you know why you did what you did and what effect it had, just put it on paper. Protip: keep notes each quarter of any changes you’re making and why as you’re going through the simulation. My final report was 17 pages, but there were a lot of graphs and charts. Task 3 is honestly the easiest task in the whole program. It’s a period of reflection, you write about what you learned, how it helped you, and how it will help you in the future. Then you update your resume, linkedin profile, and upload some artifacts. What kind of artifacts? Its up to you. I used my BSBA and a couple of certifications from work. \\n\\nAnd now you’re done! Just wait to receive an email asking you to complete your graduation application (I got mine this morning!). If you have the WGU app, wait until you get the owl banner and screenshot it (I can’t wait to add mine to my previous banner screenshot). This is a solid program, and even if you don’t accelerate to this pace, it is easily doable in 1 term. All you have to do is maintain a 2 week per class pace, and that’s not too rough. \\n\\nWhat’s next? I don’t know, a couple of months rest for sure. About a year ago I didn’t think I’d ever get around to finishing school, I was a couple classes short of an AA, and now I have 2 degrees! I definitely want to go back for the MSML as I read it synergizes well with the MBA for career growth. With the overlap I’d only need about 5 more classes. I’ll put it on the back burner for now until I reach a point in my career where I’ll need the advantage, for now 2 master’s degrees won’t give me an immediate benefit (but having 1 does 😊).</td>\n",

       "      <td>Recent Graduate's WGU Comp Sci Program Review and Ideal/Suggested Course List\\n# Overall Writeup of Classes Taken While at WGU\\n\\nLONG post incoming....\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the classes I will write about will change and have changed from when I've taken them (in fact one class I initially started is no longer offered in the Comp Sci program).  WGU regularly updates classes, resources, PAs/OAs, etc... so this will only reflect my experience with the classes and how I felt about the classes looking back on them not to mention \"difficulty\" is an entirely arbitrary rating based on subjective experiences/interpretations.\\n\\nMy background/Context: I started in September of 2018 working full time as an analyst at a large company.  I don't have any major family obligations, but did have some issues come up during my time at WGU which impacted how quickly I progressed through the program.\\n\\n## Overall Review\\n\\nOverall I think this is a solid program, like others I have my gripes about it in terms of resources, specific classes I'd like to see, and some of the certs, but all in all it covers enough to be a solid starting point when it comes to Computer Science.\\n\\nIn terms of areas of improvement I think that WGU could provide a better onboarding experience.  I remember being totally confused by how PAs versus OAs versus PA classes worked, for those reading this who are considering enrolling, PA can be either a \"Pre-Assessment\" (AKA: a practice test) or a \"Project-Assessment\" (AKA: complete a paper/code project and submit it for evaluation) with an OA being an \"Objective Assessment\" (AKA: a final composed (usually) of multiple choice questions).  The testing process gets even more confusing with multiple testing centers/requirements since different certs have different expectations.\\n\\nI was also initially confused by how mentors worked (basically you check in with them weekly in order to ensure that you're on track/not running into any roadblocks).  After changing mentors multiple times due to internal WGU changes, I ended up with an amazing mentor, and I can say without a doubt that a good mentor can make a world of difference that makes or breaks things for you.  Your mentor should align with you and your needs, all of my mentors were fine, but I had one or two where although we got along we had different ideas and concepts on how to approach classes that made it more difficult for me, but my final mentor was EXTREMELY easy to work with, understanding, and gave me the tools I needed to succeed.\\n\\nLike anything else there are tradeoffs with the program.  The WGU Comp Sci program is extremely convenient and flexible, especially for someone like me who was/is working full time, the tradeoff with it is that some of the resources could be better and it's not as specialized as other programs, but for me it was worth it.\\n\\nIf you're reading this wondering if you should enroll in WGU since everyone's situation is different, know what you want out of it going in, leverage the advantages you have, and do your best to decide if the program is right for you.\\n\\nIf someone were getting ready to prepare for starting the program who had no background in IT/computer science I'd recommend a few things:\\n\\n1. Do certification or two such as Net+, A+, Project+, etc... All of them are established, have solid study material, and are close to what you can expect with the program.  This is especially useful if you don't have background in IT and can be a decent benchmark for understanding potential areas of improvement.\\n2. Take as many classes as you can through Staighterline, Study.com, etc... just make it easier (and likely cheaper) on yourself.\\n3. Take about a month or so (especially if it's your first programming language/experience) and learn Python, it's relatively easy to read, and quick to pick up. Automate the Boring Stuff is a good resource and there are tons of YouTube tutorials on Python.  Go through all the standard stuff including variables, loops, branching/control flow, functions, and classes/object oriented programming.  Once you know enough to be able to comfortably build a \"car\" class and associated functions you're good.\\n\\n## C172 - Network and Security Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis class was relatively straightforward for me, I was able to reach out to my mentor and get some additional material, but covering IP address, networking hardware and its capabilities/limitations, and network security are pretty much what I remember from this course.\\n\\n## C173 - Scripting and Programming Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis class is reasonably easy even if they do throw some curveballs/unexpected bits at you in terms of the range of algorithms/languages you'll see on the OA.  As long as you can recognize programming languages, some of their eccentricities/concepts, and major algorithms, you'll have most of it down for this OA and this class\\n\\n## C177 - Business of IT - Project Management\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class was the CompTIA Project+ certification and resulted in memorizing a lot of jargon and business processes.  While I think it gives a good overview and insight into the business side of things this class can be tedious.  Because of the way that CompTIA structures, words, and writes their exams, I remember this exam giving me anxiety because it seemed like so many answers could fit a given question and being frustrated with having to choose the \"best\" answer.\\n\\n## C182 - Introduction to IT\\n\\nDifficulty: 2/10\\n\\nThis class is a good overview and introduction to most things IT and the OA isn't too bad and doesn't throw any real curveballs as I recall.\\n\\n## C779 - Web Development Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class at the time I took it was strangely difficult, not necessarily because of the content but because the class was outdated in several ways and because of the way the questions were framed.  I sincerely hope they've updated this class since, but it did make me more familiar with web concepts, accessibility, and other aspects of the web.\\n\\n## C958 - Calculus 1\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class took me about 4 months and the primary reason why I passed is because of Khan Academy's Calculus AB which gave me all the skills I needed to pass and in my opinion was far better than the ZyBook.\\n\\n## C867 - Scripting and Programming Applications\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class was a challenge and took me a month to complete.  Being the first hands on/coding class it definitely introduced a number of concepts and ideas that were tough to implement.  I know that they've removed the Book Keeping video series that went along with this class, and hope that they bring some kind of video/lecture series to accompany this class, because it's easy to see how students could get overwhelmed if this is their first time programming.\\n\\n## C959 - Discrete Math 1\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was a lot of material to cover with a fair amount of detail and minute.  I remember having to make a substatinial number of notecards for this class and cover the logic rules especially hard.  I failed the OA the first time because of all the trouble I had with proofs.  Once you get past Unit 1 it gets to be more manageable though.\\n\\n## C175 - Data Management Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class wasn't too bad, but for it I relied heavily on outside sources in order to better understand ETL, E-R diagrams, normalization, and the basic concepts of databases.  Overall a solid introduction to databases.\\n\\n## C170 - Data Management Applications\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis class was a good application of everything that C175 - Data Management Foundations introduced and was made a ton easier by the labs and being able to repeatedly practice what needed to be known for the OA.\\n\\n## C952 - Computer Architecture\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was a lot, not only because the textbook is so lengthy and goes into a lot of detail (if I recall correctly it's a grad level textbook), but because it covers so much it's not 100% certain what will be on the OA.  Luckily there is/was a study guide on the course chatter that was good preparation for the OA.  In general this class should be more concise and focused to introduce the necessary concepts.\\n\\n## C846 - Business of IT Applications\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis was another tedious class since it's ITIL and I would HIGHLY recommend taking C177 - Business of IT - Project Management (AKA: Project+) before this class as the vocabulary/process for learning stuff is much the same and had some overlap for me.  The ITIL app for practice tests and vocabulary cards was invaluable here.\\n\\n## C960 - Discrete Math 2\\n\\nDifficulty: 8/10\\n\\nThis for me, hands down was the most challenging class in the entire program.  Other people will definitely disagree with me here, as I've seen a number of posts saying that it was relatively easy for them, for me it took 3 terms (18 months) to pass this class and 3 tries at the OA.  This class has a lot of material, and a lot of detail associated with all of that material.  Specifically sections 4 and 5 covering probability and Bayes' theorem were the most challenging aspects for me and unit 3 on recursion seemed to be almost useless in the ZyBook.  I had to HEAVILY rely on outside resources on this one and at one point had daily calls with mentors to go over questions, concepts, and material.  I genuinely want them to make a video companion series to go along with this class at some point.\\n\\n## C188 - Software Engineering\\n\\nDifficulty: 3/10\\n\\nThis class was fairly easy as it is a paper that is straightforward and clear in what is needed and expected.  Overall it took under a week to do everything that was required of the paper that needed some research to complete.  Overall I wouldn't change this class too much.\\n\\n## C191 - Operating Systems for Programmers\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was another class that was primarily vocabulary based, but it was within a much broader context that required connecting the vocabulary learned to the larger concepts the illustrated.  Overall not a bad class, just a large word dump in some ways that I didn't fully appreciate.\\n\\n## C482 - Software 1\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was a struggle as it introduced a number of new things, but it really helped me grow as a programmer in terms of organizing the code, how to approach things, and internalizing new concepts.  I enjoyed it overall.\\n\\n## C195 - Advanced Java Concepts\\n\\nDifficulty: 7/10\\n\\nThis class really builds on C482 - Software 1 and extends it and I was grateful for that since it introduced some new challenges and things to consider that I hadn't thought of before.  Overall another fun project class that could be frustrating at times due to the challenges presented.\\n\\n## C836 - Fundamentals of Information Security\\n\\nDifficulty: 3/10\\n\\nIf I recall correctly I did this class over a weekend, if you've already taken C172 - Network and Security Foundations there is some overlap for the security section here.  Knowing the CIA triad and security approaches/attacks is what is focused on here and was a fun class for me since I enjoy InfoSec stuff.\\n\\n## C857 - Software Quality Assurance\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class is useful in how it introduces testing concepts and terminology, but the book wasn't the best, and the lectures/slides that went along with this class pretty much said the same thing.  I know this is one of the classes that they've changed/updated since I've taken, ESPECIALLY since it was first introduced and was a total mess in terms of the mis-alignment between expectations on the PA and the OA.\\n\\n## C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms 2\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nI thought that this class was a fun challenge and really focused on optimization and organization.  Overall I learned a fair bit from this class about Python and I found the class enjoyable.\\n\\n## C951 - Intro to AI\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nI got the second version of this class with 2 projects (chatbot AI and BubbleRob) and a paper.  I thought that the paper worked REALLY well going into the Capstone and although the projects were slightly tedious, they taught me a fair amount about the limitations and considerations when it comes to AI.\\n\\n## D191 - Advanced Data Management\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nDatabases aren't my thing, but I found this class useful for understanding how to effectively implement JOINS and more complex queries in PSQL.  The lab(s)/virtual environment were useful here for being able to practice for the PA.\\n\\n## D194 - IT Leadership Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 3/10\\n\\nThis class is easy as it relies on a self-evaluation and the associated paper.  It gives some language and insight into various strengths/areas of improvement and can be done over a weekend or less.\\n\\n## C964 - Capstone\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThe Capstone is a project that you design and implement (within the constraints of the requirements for it to be viable for a business product that uses machine learning in some way).  For me I implemented something using Python/Flask and and HTML/JS dashboard.  From what I gather most people often end up using Python because of its extensive ML libraries and its relative ease of use.  For me this was a fun challenge that I got to write about and wouldn't mind if I had to do something like this again.\\n\\n## Course Order Recommendation\\n\\nNOTE: I transferred in with a degree from a previous institution that took care of most/all of my gen-eds so modify this list as you see fit and with what works best for you in discussions with your mentor.\\n\\nLooking through my transcript, and thinking back on my time at WGU, this is the course order I would take if I had to do it over again.  Others are likely, and welcome, to disagree, but this is ideally what would have worked for me and my needs.\\n\\nI'll present the classes in blocks of what would be expected in a term (usually 4 classes sometimes less) followed by why I think the classes belong in that particular block.\\n\\nAgain, this list is based off of the classes that I had to finish, so your mileage may vary.\\n\\nIn speaking with my mentor(s), the classes that most often trip people up are as follows:\\n\\n* The math class(es)\\n* Scripting and Programming Applications\\n* Data Structures and Algorithms 2\\n\\nBeyond that I've also seen people struggle with\\n\\n* Networking and Security\\n* Business of IT and/or project management because it's so jargon heavy\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 1 (The setup block)\\n\\nC958 - Calculus 1\\n\\nC182 - Intro to IT\\n\\nC959 - Discrete Math 1\\n\\nC173 - Scripting and Programming Foundations\\n\\nThis block is set up so that it goes from a challenging class (calc) to an easier one (intro to IT), then a challenging class again (DM1) and then sets you up to start learning programming fundamentals and prepare for DM2\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 2 (The DM2 and errata block)\\n\\nC949 - Data Structures/Algos 1\\n\\nC960 - Discrete Math 2\\n\\nC779 - Web Development Foundations\\n\\nC176 - Business of IT/Project Management OR C172 - Network and Security Foundations\\n\\nThis block has a bit of everything from more DM2 prep with DSA1 to DM2 to some HTML/CSS with Web dev foundations and one of more jargon heavy/tech heavy classes in either project management or networking.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 3 (The database block)\\n\\nC175 - Data Management Foundations\\n\\nC170 - Data Management Applications\\n\\nD191 - Advanced Data Management\\n\\nC176 - Business of IT/Project Management OR C172 - Network and Security Foundations (whichever one you did NOT take in the previous block)\\n\\nThis block progressively builds on everything with databases and streamlines it, and then adds in the additional class of either project management or networking that is still outstanding\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 4 (The programming, business, and theory block)\\n\\nC867 - Scripting and Programming Applications\\n\\nC846 - Business of IT Applications\\n\\nC188 - Software Engineering\\n\\nC952 - Computer Architecture\\n\\nThis block encompasses a little bit of everything, it moves from hands on programming in Scripting/Programming Applications to more business and jargon heavy stuff with Business of IT applications, and moves the the relatively easy software engineering and then finishes up with the challenging computer architecture\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 5 (The programming heavy block)\\n\\nC482 - Software 1\\n\\nC195 - Software 2 Advanced Java Concepts\\n\\nD194 - IT Leadership Foundations\\n\\nBoth of the classes listed above are 6 units each and are therefore a full term.  I do think that these classes should be back to back as the concepts you'll use from Java/Java FX in software one are directly applicable to Software 2, software 2 just adds databases and a couple of extra things on top of it.  To finish up is IT leadership foundations which is a personality self assessment and associated paper(s) that can be done in a weekend (or less).\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 6 (The almost there block)\\n\\nC191 - Operating Systems for Programmers\\n\\nC836 - Fundamental of Information Security\\n\\nC951 - Intro to AI\\n\\nC857 - Software Quality Assurance\\n\\nThis block throws together a lot of stuff, with OS there is some overlap with computer architecture from block 4, fundamentals of information security is made easier if you've already gone through networking as some of the same topics are covered.  Intro to AI isn't too tough of a course and prepares you for the Capstone in the next block and software quality assurance is a solid class after they've gone through and updated it/the material for it.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 7 (The finish line)\\n\\nC950 - Data Structures and Algorithms 2\\n\\nC964 - Computer Science Capstone\\n\\nOK, that's it for me.  Given such a long post with a number of moving parts, I've probably made some mistakes in here, feel free to let me know and I'll correct it.  If you have any other questions posted in the comments I'll do my best to respond to them.</td>\n",

       "      <td>30 Day MBA Experience Executive Summary\\nEDIT:  In response to a comment that there's \"something I'm not telling you\", I decided to add a section prior to C202 explaining how I used the time after orientation to help me prepare. Contrary to the person's assumptions/accusations, I did not engage in pre-writing, nor did I solicit rubrics, pre-written papers, etc., but I did make use of the time in relevant ways that I will describe further below.\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nI started my MBA on 4/1 officially, got my capstone final task approved on 4/29, and have successfully filed for my diploma and graduation. I wanted to thank all of the folks on this Reddit, along with those on Facebook (the WGU Business page, as well as the WGU accelerators page) for the information and the support that they've provided, which were a big help in me finishing when I could. Below is a summary of my experience, a couple of tips, and a small description of how I approached each course.\\n\\nOverall notes\\n\\nI loved my program mentor overall. One thing I did need to get used to was that she opened C200, C202, and C204 to start, and wouldn't really open courses for me until I finished all of the courses. This was annoying because there were a couple of times early that I needed to wait (it was really like a day or so, but at my pace I didn't want to lose days). So, I needed to establish a pace where I let her know ahead when I finished one course, and she would accelerate the next one while I finished the other (after the first set of three, I pretty much had two at a time open). She did let me choose my sequence after the first 3, so I was strategic on my choices based on what I knew (OA vs Performance Assessment, how I did on the pre-assessment, existing knowledge, etc.). Below are some details on my experience with each, and how I made decisions within each course that ultimately led to my success.\\n\\n**Edit: Added this paragraph below since I remembered it while rewriting the other things.** \\n\\nTip for the OAs: Sometimes the proctor's aren't available right at the time (e.g., sometimes it's 8:07 for an 8:00 PM and the proceed button isn't available). If it takes too long (which happened to me a couple of times, but some people complained about it a ton on Facebook), I would just use the chat feature on the bottom right and let them know. The couple of times I did this (literally 2 times), they were able to get me started within about 5minutes or so. As a generally rule, I'd plan for about 15-20 minutes longer than your anticipated start time and completion time when you are scheduling your tests. This seemed to piss a lot of people off, but my feeling is if you plan on it being 15-20 minutes longer, then just be patient (you'll be fine waiting a bit, no big deal). I do get that some people are REALLY constrained for time, so I get it, but plan for it and you'll generally be fine with the proctors as long as you follow the rules (in my experience, at least).\\n\\n*Orientation - Completed on 3/15*\\n\\nThis was quite easy - just complete all of the required tasks. Was more than I expected to need to do, but was my first experience in seeing the rubrics, the submission system, etc. Was not a big deal.\\n\\n**EDIT:  Paragraphs below have been added to describe my use of pre-launch time, a critical phase to my final completion time.**\\n\\n*Pre-Launch - 16 days (3/15-3/31)*\\n\\nAn important part of my MBA time was some of the work I did during the pre-launch time. I want to emphasize that I used solely information available on the \"Class Preview\" versions of the site (which allows access to the pre-assessments and the course resource pages, I think). I took all the pre-assessments, passing all of them except for Financial Management, which I failed bit just a little bit. The pre-assessments let me know what areas I was weakest in, which were relevant in helping me determine which areas to focus on. Another thing that I did was be aware of what textbooks were used for the courses (using Reddit, primarily). While I was not able to obtain most of the books (e.g., those posted on 3rd party online sources such as Accounting), I was able to find similar books/older editions that I could use. There isn't really enough time to read all of the textbooks, but I did use some of this time to studying an older version of the book for C202 (a Human Resources book). Because this topic was new to me, I did read more or less the entire book (and because I did not have access to a lot of other stuff). That was the main book I read ahead of time (the other book I read completely was Accounting, another area completely new to me, but I did in fact do that during the term). Other than that reading, the other thing I did was curate all of the resources I could from the course websites about each of the tasks. Reddit provided some info, and the website constructed some info. Note that not all classes have slides/tips on the resources, so for some tasks I was more or less left in the dark (although I could determine from the Reddit posts of others *generally* what they are. I engaged a lot in \"brainstorming\" about each of the papers (e.g., if a paper was talking about an individual, I thought about who I would write about and what I would write). I did not, however, prep any materials ahead of time, partially due to the fact that you cannot view any of the rubrics, and it is generally suggested to write to the rubric (which I think is solid advice). One thing I did do that was helpful was copy and paste the instructions into the assignments and fill out my papers kind of like a worksheet (Section A - response for Section A. Section B - responses for Section B... etc.). This helped with ensuring that I met all of the rubric requirements and helped the evaluators find information (I did require a handful of revisions throughout, which I will generally note). The revisions tended not to waste too much time, as I tried to always have a second course open so that I could work on that while I waited for revisions to be approved for the other (you need mentor support in making sure things are open when you need them, and my mentor wouldn't allow me to have more than 2 open at a time, other than at the beginning when I had the first 3 open).\\n\\nI want to reiterate that I did not have the rubrics ahead of time, write a single page ahead of time, or read through/copy/receive any assignments from anyone else. Every single thing I wrote was my own work, and inspired only by the textbooks and papers I read (in a few small cases).  In any case, I used the time to scour the site for any and all information I could use to help me be mentally prepared for the tasks. When 4/1 hit (in fact, several hours into it, because materials don't really launch until noon on the first day typically, which I didn't know ahead of time), I was good to begin my work on the first 3 courses.\\n\\n*C202 - Managing Human Capital (1 OA) - 1 day (4/1)*\\n\\nThis was my first OA. I took the pre-assessment and passed, so I felt confident going in. To prep for this course, I read through the whole textbook at a light skim, picked up some things I didn't know before, and focused on particular points I recognized from the PA that I wanted to focus more on (and read more thoroughly in those sections). I took this test on the first evening after my skim/lighter reading and was all set. I could not open other courses at this point, so I continued with C200, which was already open, but would require more time (as it was a PA course).\\n\\n*C200 - Managing Organizations and Leading People (2 PA tasks, both papers) - 4 days from open (4/4)*\\n\\nThis course required two performance assessments, as well as a leadership assessment (CliftonStrengths) as part of one of the tasks. These were both very manageable tasks. I spent the most time in this class reading through a couple of papers to find good sources (this was actually one of the few that I had to/bothered to do this in). These look me a bit longer than average to complete compared to the others, so it took me a couple of days to get it done. In terms of reading, I looked at the materials related to the tasks (and the relevant papers). I did not look at any of the other course materials. After finishing this, I had C211 opened.\\n\\n*C211 - Global Economics for Managers (1 OA) - 2 days (4/6)*\\n\\nI passed this pre-assessment as well (although more marginally), so I wanted to take this one out. Apparently, a lot of people do find this test hard, but I did take Economics in college, and have made some efforts to learn some of these things on my own in the past. I focused on a read/skim approach on my areas of weakness from the pre-assessment, and was able to pass this pretty quickly (2 days after opening it). Test was absolutely fine, but my light approach to reading (only reading a couple of small areas) led to only a marginal improvement from the pre-assessment to the OA, but it was a solid pass, so it was good enough. With this done, I focused on C204 (my last remaining class). I think I was slowed down a bit, as my mentor made me wait until finishing C204 before I could continue (which annoyed me a bit, but forced me to focused on that next).\\n\\n*C204 - Management Communication (2 tasks - 1 paper, and 1 presentation/video/executive summary) - 8 days (4/8)*\\n\\nThis one took me a bit longer because the work was a bit more extensive. I also was traveling on 4/2-4/4, and on 4/5, so I was only able to do this on 4/8 after I was done traveling (as I needed to make a video presentation). These tasks were more extensive, so there was a lot more work involved. I relied on the textbook only, and focused exclusively on the sections related to the tasks. I maybe BARELY did a light skim on other materials, but honestly skipped a lot of it, as it was not relevant to what I needed to do. The tasks ultimately went down pretty easily (once I sat down to do them). I had to slow down a lot because of all the traveling and needing to shoot the video, but things sped up a bit from here for a while. This allowed me to open up C215.\\n\\n*C215 - Operations Management (1 OA) - 1 day (4/9)*\\n\\nFor this one, I BARELY touched the book (except for some last minute skimming the last hour before the exam). I passed the pre-assessment (barely), so I felt ok, but I focused on watching Dr. Haywood's videos on youtube (which tons of people recommended). Watching these boosted my knowledge about the area quite a bit (although he doesn't really touch any of the math, which isn't needed anyways). I was able to pass this OA immediately pretty much because I had watched all the videos. With that knowledge, it was pretty easy. The videos are very easy to understand and help with the OA a lot, so I HIGHLY recommend watching them (and use the book as a supplement too, if you need/want to). After this, I had C206 opened, and C207 opened (I was able to get two courses at a time by this point, which allowed me some flexibility in working on tasks)\\n\\n*C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs - all papers) - 4 days (4/13, including revision time)*\\n\\nThis one required a LOT of writing, as it is three papers! That said, a lot is based on other materials (case study, ethical leadership inventory, code of ethics), and so I barely touched the course text materials at all. I just diligently wrote and got everything done. I had to do a couple of revisions here because there was a lot to write and I missed a couple of things here and there, but it was easy once I knew what was missing to fill in the gaps. Revisions took me an extra day or so (one happened on day 3 for a task I submitted earlier, and another happened on day 4, which was what moved me to 4 days for the course. After this, I went to C207, which I already had open.\\n\\n*C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (1 OA, 2 PAs) - 5 days after open (4/14, including revision time)*\\n\\nI have a lot of expertise and experience and did well on the pre-assessment, so I looked at pretty much nothing here. I was able to do the two PAs pretty quickly, but also quickly realized that I didn't know what they were asking for in places (I felt the wording was strange). I had to resubmit both of these, and even had to do one of them a total of 3 times to pass. These also, for some reason, required getting instructor approval. This was the one course I worked with the prof but I did take advantage of it by asking them to look at the work. They gave me some tips that were helpful in terms of understanding what they wanted and I was able to pass (although it took more revisions across the board than any other course). Without studying, I took the OA, and was able to pass that (although I scored about the same as the pre-assessment, which makes sense). The OA was harder than I Was expecting, so I was a bit disappointed. Nevertheless, I finished this and was able to move on to C212.\\n\\n*C212 - Marketing (1 PA) - 1 day (4/15)*\\n\\nThis class required one pretty long paper. I looked at only the materials related to the paper and nothing else. I wrote the paper in about 4 hours, I think (ignoring my actual job that day...oops). I passed quite easily in one attempt (just was a lot of writing). This allowed me to move on to C213\\n\\n*C213 - Accounting for Decision-makers (1 OA) - 7 days (4/22)*\\n\\nI was a bit concerned about this course, as it was pretty much all brand new to me, and because I knew it was considered one of the two hardest classes (behind Financial management). For this one, I read the book cover to cover. I had passed the pre-assessment marginally using prior knowledge, but reading the book helped a ton, and I passed the OA fairly easily after all the studying. I had gone out of town for a few days again, so it took some time before I could sit for the exam. I used a few days to read all of the book pages, and then used the rest of the time to focus on C214 before sitting for this exam.\\n\\n*C214 - Financial Management (1 OA) - 1 day (4/23)*\\n\\nThis was the one pre-assessment I failed (barely), and I knew this was a hard course. After opening the course, I learned that the videos provided on the site (rather than the book) were the most useful materials. I basically read through a few chapters while working through the accounting, and then switched to the videos after learning about them. The videos (posted on the course site) were about 4.5 hours or so, and were all I studied other than those few chapters I read before. I did not watch the additional 1 hour calculations video that was also available because I felt I knew enough. That said, there was a LOT of math on the OA, and I honestly didn't know how to get the calculator (I had the TI BA II recommended calculator). That all said, I passed with a pretty good score (I think I may have guessed well in a few places where I couldn't figure out the calculator as well. I sat for this exam one day after C213, and was done with this course. This test took me like 1 hour and 40 minutes total (far longer than any other exam, which generally ranged from 30-60 minutes for me). But I passed and moved forward, leaving only the capstone.\\n\\n*C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs) - 4 days (4/27)*\\n\\nFor this, there was a business simulation and two associated tasks, as well as a profession portfolio PA. I had pretty much everything I needed for the portfolio, so this took a couple of hours to knock out and prepare for submission. However, I did need to finish the simulation and the two tasks first. Task 2 must be completed after Task 1 is passed, so I did task 1's simulation part and finished the task, and had to wait a day before getting to Task 2. After that, I finished the simulation (which I thought was an AMAZING way to integrate all that I studied and learned), and then completed Task 2. Both of these tasks passed within one attempt, and I submitted Task 2 simultaneously with Task 3, and my last days just involved waiting for approval, which happened yesterday (4/29).\\n\\nAfter all this, I filled out the graduation paperwork and am waiting on that. With all that, I completed my work within 27 days, and am slated for graduated after 29. It was quite a road, and a lovely experience. I'd love to study more if it wouldn't cost another 5k, and am eager to see what's next.\\n\\nI'm happy to share this with all of you, and am also happy to answer any questions that anyone might have! I would highly recommend this process, especially for motivated folks who can work well independently, and hope that I can use what I've learned for my work in the near future!</td>\n",

[My Full MBA Journey &amp; Advice](https://youtu.be/bozAL8FguH8)\\n2. [How I got every Capstone Excellence Award &amp; top 10% globally on the simulation](https://youtu.be/gDhBwrhvmEc)\\n3. [u/Sleyk2010 MBA Speedrun Guide (Not Mine: Somewhat dated, but Very Useful)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\n  \\n**On Legitimizing Acceleration:**\\n\\nA common argument against acceleration is “But how much did you really learn?” I believe that the Excellence Award provides the perfect counter to this argument. By proving a MASTERY of concepts in the degree plan, you get to prove your business chops while getting an extra few resume items to stand out in applications. (Also, nobody NEEDS to know how fast you earned your degree) \\n\\nAnother Piece of advice: **Do your assignments on real businesses.** This gives you more experience in the course material and further legitimizes your resume with real-world projects. For example, instead of just writing a marketing proposal for a fictional business, reach out to a business in your community and do work for them. Many of the assignments can help real businesses if you’re creative enough… You’re already doing the work; you might as well allow somebody else to profit from it.\\n\\n\\n\\nRules: updated from [This AMAZING resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n* WRITE TO THE RUBRIC – A strategy that I developed for papers was to upload [This Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6FWjGvKR5H7DCgRaLvpmh5rssFz-0RS/view?usp=sharing) onto Google Docs, add each section of the rubric to the paper with a comment describing the requirements, and open the resource manager. This gives you everything you need on one screen, with the added benefit of being transferable between devices. By doing this, I was able to write most assignments in 2-3 fewer pages than recommended and still pass the first try. (For a visual demo go to 5:28 in [My Full MBA Journey &amp; Advice](https://youtu.be/bozAL8FguH8))\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s**~~: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est~~* ***~~pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try~~***~~\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*~~\\n\\n* Not True – **I would actually recommend doing the opposite**. I would intentionally fail the pretest to give myself a better understanding of what to study for the real exam. (I’ll break this strategy down later)\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\n* The best part about failing is that they will tell you exactly what (and sometimes how) to fix. This can be great for speedrunning because it allows you to quickly submit your fist draft and let the instructor tell you which areas need improvement **instead of worrying about if you did enough.**\\n\\n\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n* **Course Resources:** This should be THE FIRST place you go when enrolling in a course. It will have helpful resources that explain, in great detail, what the instructors are looking for in the assignment\\n   * Course Resources will have everything you need to pass - I wouldn’t bother with external resources like quizlet unless something really isn’t clicking.\\n* **Using the Pretest:** This strategy helped me crush my courses with OA’s: \\n   * Take the test immediately – \\n      * **Don’t Guess!** If the question seems common sense, guess; however, if it’s something like an equation that you don’t know how to solve, leave it blank. This will let you ID which questions you will need to explicitly study before trying the real exam.\\n   * Review the sections you failed\\n   * Review the exam questions right before the test to see how much you improved / ID any “gotcha” questions.\\n   * Don’t retake the pretest – go straight to the final and take it. \\n   * Good Luck :)\\n* **Schedule your test as soon as the option is available**. This instantly gives you a deadline to beat procrastination. If you don’t feel ready, you can always reschedule for an hour or two later, but having a deadline will help you stay motivated and not waste time studying.\\n* Do yourself a favor and **download the free Grammarly plugin.**\\n\\n\\n\\nOutline:\\n\\nMy Overall advice is to **speedrun the degree, master the capstone.** For me, *burnout came from going slower, not faster.* It’s easy to begin overthinking assignments and slowly lose traction. I believe that the best way to get through the degree is to produce a minimally viable project, submit it, and then revise if needed. Then, when capstone comes, go all out and show off everything you’ve learned.\\n\\n\\n\\nORA -1 \\n\\nTake care of this as soon as possible. PLEASE Don’t be like me and wait until the semester begins. Because I waited so long, it delayed my actual start date by 1 day :(\\n\\n\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital - **Super easy, 1 Day, 2 papers, (15 pages total).**\\n\\nEZPZ class. The link for the Signature Themes can be hard to find, so I’ll add it here, but once you’ve done that, just write to the rubric. Once you’ve done that, assignment one is easy. They recommend breaking it up over 5 days… you can do it in about 3-4 hours once you have the report. The second paper is just a rubric-based rant. As long as you can find scholarly articles and USE THE CITATION MANAGER, you can easily get this course done in a day. \\n\\n\\n\\nC200 - Managing Organizations and Leading People - **Super easy, 1 Day, 1 Exam**\\n\\nAfter submitting C202’s essays, I did the pretest before bed and passed - there are a lot of common sense questions. It took me a little longer to complete this course because I had to figure out how to use the online proctoring service. The hardest part about this course is convincing yourself that you’re ready without reading anything. Once I did that, I scheduled the exam, reviewed the practice test, and passed the real exam.\\n\\n\\n\\nMGT2 – IT Project Management - **Easy/medium but fun, 2-3 days, 3 papers**\\n\\nTIP: Make sure you check the bottom of the assignments tab for assignment templates. \\n\\nThis course, probably because it’s more technical, had tutorials for each of the assignments. I would HIGHLY recommend following those tutorials step-by-step to ensure that you meet the criteria for the assignments. I made the mistake of thinking I could make a better GANTT chart with better software, only to have to redo the entire thing in ProjectLibre (their recommended software) to meet the criteria of the assignment. Though it was tedious, it was VERY relevant to the field of IT which made it interesting and reliable for me. As long as you follow the rubrics and the tutorials, you can complete it in 2 days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\*\\*\\* I took 9 days off because my family was in town. During this time, IT PM class sent back assignments for revisions. It was a nice little break :) \\*\\*\\*\\n\\n\\n\\nC213 – Accounting for Decision Makers - Medium Class,  3ish days, 1 exam\\n\\nWhen I took the pretest for this course, I failed every section, so this was the first course that I actually spent time going through course materials. This is the first class where my testing strategy (described above) can really help you dial in on what to study. Depending on your exposure to accounting (I had none), this may be a tough class. That being said, it’s easy to overstudy, which is definitely what happened to me. I would recommend learning about the 3 financial statements in detail and just reading the summary of all the other chapters (usually the first and last sections in each chapter).\\n\\n\\n\\nC212 – Marketing - Medium, 1 day, 1 essay\\n\\nOne long paper, but if you **apply it to a real-world project**, it can be really fun and motivating. For me, my friend has always thought about starting his own business, so it was really cool to talk to him about his business one day and send him a 13 page marketing plan the next. My only advice is to make sure you follow the rubric and check out the course resources for a video explanation. The video will tell you where to locate some of course-material-related requirements. It’s easy to accomplish in a day if you’ve got the stamina.\\n\\n\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management - \\n\\nIf you don’t need a break after Accounting, I would recommend taking financial management right after it.\\n\\nI failed the pretest, but this gave me an opportunity to discover something that CHANGED THE GAME: **The Course Resources tab**. Each course has a section where the instructors have compiled bootcamps, webinars, and additional worksheets specifically targeted to helping you pass your final (Test or Exam). By using these resources, I scheduled my exam for the next day and passed. For the rest of the challenge, whenever I started a new class, the first place I checked was the Course Resources tab. \\n\\n\\n\\nMMT2 – IT Strategic Solutions - Medium difficulty, 5 days, 3 assignments\\n\\nMy advice is to start this course as soon as it becomes available - you have to complete one assignment before you can start the next. This course was a masterclass in waiting - You wait for an instructor’s approval signature before you can submit the first assignment and then wait in between each assignment.If you’re accelerating, it’s even more important to make sure you’re writing to the rubric because having to redo any of the assignments will set everything back. I’d recommend submitting an assignment and then starting on another course while you’re waiting to maximize your time.\\n\\n\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership - Easy class, 1 day, 3 essays\\n\\nFor the first assignment, you need to take the Ethical Lens test [https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/98150994](https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/98150994) \\- The first assignment is pretty much just rephrasing the report. The next two assignments aren’t bad - I had to reference the textbook for a few of the sections, but as long as you follow the rubric, you’ll be fine.\\n\\nAnother cool thing that happened was that I got notified of my FIRST Excellence Award!!! This changed everything… Thankfully, I only had 2 courses left.\\n\\n\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers, Hardest Class (for me), 2-3 days, 1 Exam\\n\\nWay more difficult than people give it credit for… If you’re new to Economics, there are a lot of things that don’t mean what you think they would mean. Even so, I’d recommend taking the pre-test right away, watching all of the review sessions in the course resources, \\n\\n\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making - Medium Class, 1-2 days, 1 exam + 2 assignments\\n\\nI think there’s a lot of bad intel about this course - yes, it has a test and 2 assignments, but there are course resources that pretty much explain how to perform all the calculations for the analysis. I completed the course little differently: I took the exam then started on the assignments. Looking back, I think that this helped me to study what was important without getting lost in the details. If I hadn’t had to submit Task 1 (2 times) and task 2 (3 times), I would have completed everything in a day. I say all this to encourage you that it’s not as bad as people make it sound :)\\n\\n\\n\\nC218 – Capstone \\n\\nStart with this video: [How I got every Capstone Excellence Award &amp; top 10% globally on the simulation](https://youtu.be/gDhBwrhvmEc)\\n\\nThis is a fun course, but it can easily spiral out of the timeframe you allow. For me, I wanted to take extra time because **I wanted an excellence award** for the whole program. Since they consider your performance in all the capstone assignments, I wanted to make sure they were as good as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6jabyafvdpe1.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b0c78f6cdb4dc4bb1dc46cf622c7d793e686bbba\\n\\nCAPSIM: Very Fun. Looking back, I spent way too long optimizing minor decisions; however, it paid off because I was able to score in the top 10% globally on the simulation (to secure the CAPSIM Excellence Award). If you’re interested in overachieving, these are the resources that will help:\\n\\n* [How I got every Capstone Excellence Award &amp; top 10% globally on the simulation](https://youtu.be/gDhBwrhvmEc)\\n* [https://www.reddit.com/user/thesocialbolt/comments/z53lu3/wgu\\_d361\\_business\\_simulation\\_how\\_i\\_completed\\_in\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/user/thesocialbolt/comments/z53lu3/wgu_d361_business_simulation_how_i_completed_in_1/)\\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/18nx1gn/mba\\_capstone\\_simulation\\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/18nx1gn/mba_capstone_simulation_tips/)\\n\\nTip: If you get top 10%, ADD YOUR BADGE TO LINKEDIN RIGHT AWAY!!! Once you finish the course, you lose access to the simulation and all your courses.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i37o5nmhvdpe1.png?width=1166&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aed90fb65b1b406b263ce01ff71d859b3c105028\\n\\nAssignment 1: I went beast mode on this assignment – probably took a day to compile all the information for the assignment, but then I spent the rest of the week making sure that everything was perfect. If you’re interested in getting an excellence award, customize your template’s colors, change all the generic images, show the data to support your claims, and try to bring some personal information into the project. If not, you can just use the template and pretty quickly get all the information you need from the simulation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\*\\*\\* I took a 10 day break for a family Emergency \\*\\*\\*\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5g249livdpe1.png?width=848&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e63e768ff07b726b655309855b418a0d7e36060\\n\\nAssignment 2: This one wraps up the entire simulation - It’s a review of everything you did in the form of a stockholder report. They recommended \\~15 pages to complete it, but mine ended up being over 30 because I had a ton of stuff that I wanted to cover. If you put a decent bit of thought into your decisions in the simulation, finding content won’t be difficult as long as you use your tactical plan + Conscious reports. It’s also worth noting that they won’t give you your Capsim Excellence Award until after Assignment 2 has been evaluated.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment 3: While this assignment is the easiest one, it’s probably the most important. Building a resume and setting up a linkedin account is the perfect way to prepare for new jobs and show off your new degree (with excellence). \\n\\n\\n\\nNote from me:\\n\\nIf there’s one thing I’d love for you to take from reading this, it’s that **you can do it**. Whether or not you choose to accelerate, WGU provides you with everything you need to get through your courses and distinguish yourself with your degree. If you are accelerating, just know that fast doesn’t necessarily mean easy. Acceleration will make the degree way more difficult, but it’s totally worth it.\\n\\nIt’s probably worth mentioning that I had about 3 weeks of leave that I burned in the beginning. I added the details about my personal life to show that even when crazy things come up, you can still push through and keep making progress on your degree. If you don’t want to burn personal leave, you could probably knock out a course every weekend pretty easily.\\n\\nI’m truly thankful to WGU and all the redditors who helped encourage me to get my MBA. I hope that this post helps you on your journey :) Good luck!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Review of all WGU classes I took + tips (as an experienced software engineer)\\nI have benefitted extensively from reddit and discord throughout this process, so I thought I would give back now that I passed the capstone. \\n\\nAs the title says, I'm an experienced engineer (\\~8 YOE), but I have worked mostly on front end web dev, almost exclusively React. I went to a 3 month bootcamp back in the day. I pretty much only wrote JavaScript before pursuing this degree, so a lot of this material was brand new to me. I do feel like I have a good handle of what is important to know and what isn't for work though, so hopefully this post will give you some insight into that. The following list of classes are in the order I passed them.\\n\\n* **Version Control – D197**: This class is insanely easy if you have worked in the industry even a little bit. It's just basic git commands. Took me 2 hours between activating the class and submitting my PA, and most of that time was just figuring out what the assignment wanted. If git is new to you, learn it well. This is extremely useful and important for any SWE job. Practice what you learned in this classes in every coding class going forward, even if commits are not a requirement.\\n\\n* **Scripting and Programming - Applications – C867:** I'll be honest, I was a bit humbled by this class. I thought I could knock it out in 2 days but I think it took me about a week instead. It's one of the better coding classes in my opinion. You have some autonomy in how you write the code. Best tip is to find that book repo collection of videos and really understand what each line of code is doing. I've never done C++ or any serious OOP before, so I enjoyed this class and I think it's overall a useful class to pay attention to.\\n* **Business of IT - Applications – D336:** This is the first class I absolutely hated from WGU. I worked in tech, have a BS is business, and still don't get the jargons you have to learn here. I thought this would be one of those easy to pass common sense classes, but it's like my brain operates on a different wavelength from the people writing this material. Best piece of study material is the [Jason Dion Cram Sheet](https://www.scribd.com/document/750810258/ITIL-4-Foundation-Cram-Card-pdf) and beyond that, just do as many practice problems as you can until you feel like 80% ready. This is absolutely not a class you need to pay attention to for work purposes. \\n* **Discrete Mathematics II – C960:** The first hard class I took, and I loved it. I spent a lot of time before WGU warming up on math. I did precalc and calc on Sophia, and DM1 on SDC. I was good at recursion and algorithms from my bootcamp days, so that's a good chunk I didn't have to relearn. My best tip for this class is to go through all the unit worksheets. I was very weak on counting and probability so I had chatgpt quiz me over and over until I felt somewhat solid. I wouldn't waste time configuring your calculator, but know how to do nPr and nCr (built in functions). Don't skimp on this class. You might not be asked how to do these specific problems in the interview process, but this will help tremendously once you start doing leetcode problems. This was my longest WGU OA by far. Time management is key. Skip questions you don't know or know will take a while, come back once you are done with the easier/faster questions. \\n* **Java Frameworks – D287:** I'll just start by saying all the Java classes in this program suck a$$. Watch a spring tutorial, learn Java if you haven't at this point, and just follow a reddit/discord guide to pass. I followed nusa's guide on discord. This project hurt my brain because it made no sense whatsoever, and I spent way too much time overthinking it. Take all the instructions literally. I added some very basic css styling and got an excellence award lmao. Focus on understanding what an MVC is and how Springboot works, but these Java projects are very poor example of what real software looks like.\\n* **Linux Foundations – D281:** There is a guide for learning this stuff and a guide for passing this class IYKYK. I really enjoyed Shawn Power's playlist on this, and I think it's a good watch. While it is not necessary to learn a lot of this stuff to pass, I would still pay attention to the materials of this class. Not only do you absolutely use some of this stuff in a work setting, you will have an easier time later on in OS and Comp Arch. Command line murder mystery is a fun exercise to learn the essentials. As for how to pass, just join the discord channel for the class. \\n* **Back-End Programming – D288:** As much as all these Java classes suck, this one is the worst. The course material wasn't helpful, and the CIs were so hit or miss. It seems like they want you to do more set up and experience more of the development process, but this was one of those classes that you have to follow instructions carefully in each step. Not a lot of creativity allowed here. Also, you can't properly test your code in each step. It's just all really unrealistic. I wouldn't dwell too much on this class. Go to the live instructor support sessions, get help ASAP when you are stuck, and move on as quickly as possible. If anyone is wondering, I did most of the coding in my local macos environment, but also ran it in the dev environment for submission.\\n* **Advanced Java – D387:** After suffering through the previous 2 Java classes, this one should be a breeze. It took me maybe a day to do this one. Interestingly, this one resembles real work a little more. The Angular part was easy for me, but I have a lot of FE experience. I think there's a webinar that shows you how to do it as well. The docker part might be the trickiest, but I would just play around with the config file and again, plan to talk with a CI as soon as you get stuck. \\n* **Software Engineering – D284:** This class doesn't really teach you any sort of engineering. It's mostly about the software development process. I guess the process of writing this paper helps one understand what goes into planning and developing software, but don't expect this to be how it works at your job. Everyone just uses some kind of agile and no one talks \"functional requirements\". There's probably more that's useful for PMs than engineers. It's all very academic imo. Also don't be afraid to repeat yourself and make things up. Have chatgpt explain any concepts to you that you are unfamiliar with. \\n* **Software Design and Quality Assurance – D480:** This class was so horrendously hard for me, I was doubting my intelligence. The evaluators for this class is notoriously picky, but I think I also had trouble understanding what the assignment wanted me to write. It's incredibly bizarre to write about architectural and process decisions when dealing with an incredibly trivial bug. I had so many fail points in both tasks that I knew I needed to meet with an instructor to figure out what the disconnect was. I actually have a ton of debugging and testing experience, so I was very frustrated. The CI I met with told me a student was on his 6th or 7th revision. Speechless. I ended up passing on attempt 2 for both tasks. The main things I missed was 1) only front end changes should be talked about, 2) the functional requirements are the 2 different cases described 3) \"objective\" of (non)functional requirements is basically asking about why we need the requirements. Meeting with the instructors helped, but they are ultimately not the evaluators. I think learning about the different types of quality metrics and testing methodologies are useful, but overall, this class was just busy work that is poorly designed and pedantically evaluated. As someone who prefers PAs, this class would be so much better if it was an OA instead.\\n* **Data Structures and Algorithms II – C950:** I love DSA, so while this class was a lot of work, I was a fan. This might be the highest quality class of the whole program. You have total control over your environment, how the files are setup, what algorithm to use, and how you present the UI.  For this class, I read through the requirements for both tasks and met with a CI to ask clarifying questions. I did a pretty simple nearest neighbor algorithm. This was the best coding class for sure, and it felt the most like work because of all the little details you need to work on. Don't sleep on this class. I didn't expect the writeup to take as long as it did from reading the requirements, but there is a template in course search you need to use to pass this class. I ended up with a 33 page pdf for task 2 (lots of screenshots and descriptions). \\n* **Computer Architecture – C952:** I was very intimidated by this class. I've heard it's hard, and I have practically zero prior knowledge. Tbh I procrastinated a lot on this as a result. However, all you really have to do is 1) Watch all of Lunsby's videos in course search, 2) Know all the terms in the Zybook highlighted in blue, 3) Know calculations covered by Lunsby. I went through the zybook along with Lunsby's videos at 1.75x speed. This is mostly to know what is important and what isn't. Then I went through the book from start to finish only to learn the vocab and redo exercises marked. It's easier to go through the vocab in the book imo because you can learn these things in context of each other. I had chatgpt open while I did this, asked it to explain things to me (\"explain it to me like I'm 5\" literally). There's also a 20 page study guide by Jim Ashe that is really good. However you do it, the important thing is to really understand how things work together. As I went through the vocab list, I would realize something is related to another thing and ask chatgpt to confirm. FWIW, I got exemplary on this test. This class was hard, but definitely one that is worthwhile to learn properly. The OA asks you questions in a way that requires you to understand the material, even if it's just at a high level. \\n* **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – C951:** This class was a real roller coaster. 3 tasks is daunting, but the first 2 are easy. The last one is really long, but it helps with the capstone. Task 1 and 2, I would suggest to just do the minimum and move on. It's not much AI/ML tbh, but I guess it's nice to get some experience working in different environments. For the video recordings, I would suggest jotting down some bullet points before recording. Don't skimp on task 3, and absolutely checkout the requirements for capstone before starting. Use [https://ashejim.github.io/BSCS/intro.html](https://ashejim.github.io/BSCS/intro.html) . The process of writing this paper, especially the outside source review section, really helped me learn the ML needed to do the capstone. I even used the strategies in the papers I reviewed to do my actual capstone. I almost took this class at SDC, and I'm glad I ended up doing it at WGU. \\n* **Operating Systems for Programmers – C191:** This was the final boss for me. I thought maybe I can reuse my Comp Arch strategy, but that wasn't really feasible with how many more topics were covered here. Shiggy's notes (discord) are probably the best sources for this class. I went through the individual chapters, then did my best to be very solid on the topics covered by the \"Know\" and \"More to know\" docs. I had chatgpt quiz me over and over on any topic I didn't really understand. I did hundreds of multiple choice questions that way. The OA is once again written in a way that requires you to understand how things work instead of just brute force memorizing vocab, so trying to understand things from different angles help a lot. \\n* **Computer Science Capstone – C964:** Did you plan ahead doing Intro to AI? If you did, congrats because this will be a cake walk for you. The proposal is easy, and I got mine back from Ashe in a few hours. The actual coding took me about 2 hours using Google Colab. I already had my strategy lined up between AI task 3 and the proposal (visualizations). The writing was pretty easy and I was able to finish \\~80% of it with paragraphs from AI task 3. I made sure to add comments in Colab to make things easier to read and understand. I also did all 3 of my visualizations there. All in all, it took just about a day. I really enjoyed this ML project. It was a subject I previously know nothing about, and I think this opened another door for me.\\n\\nGeneral tips\\n\\n* Pick easy classes to start with. Prove to your mentor that you can finish classes fast, and you will have a really easy time getting new classes unlocked. I had 2 PAs and 1 OA classes going at the same time for most of the program. \\n* Utilize CI appointments and Live Instructor Support. Obviously don't ask them things you can google, but if you get stuck, do yourself a favor and ask for help. If there's no LIS available, book CI appointments before you need them. Sometimes you have to wait up to a week to talk to them, so book early!\\n* GRAMMARLY: I write my papers in google docs and have the grammarly plugin installed (free with WGU). I ONLY correct the suggestions in \"correctness\" and nothing else. Never had a problem with professional communication or AI claims.\\n* Always check Course search, and pay special attention to files like \"templates\", \"FAQs\" and \"common fail points\"\\n   * For coding classes, go through common fail points thoroughly\\n   * For writing classes, there is always a template of some sort\\n* Pre-assessments: I only had 3 WGU OA classes, but my strategy was basically to take PAs only when I think I might be ready for the OA, because you can only see these questions for the first time once. They covered the same topics as the OAs, but questions may be asked in different ways.\\n* Join discord! Got so much good advice there.\\n\\nMore thoughts\\n\\n* Proctoring: I bought a cheap but new HP (16GB RAM) last year to use for testing only. No problems using it for SDC or ITIL, but I spent over 2 hours trying to get it to work with Guardian, it just won't. I then wiped an old macbook air (8GB RAM) and had no problems since. Best way to test whether your laptop and connection are good enough is to run the speed test on [https://speed.cloudflare.com/](https://speed.cloudflare.com/) Make sure \"Video chatting\" is at least \"Good\". RAM is not everything! Validated after learning more in Comp Arch and OS ;) \\n* The 3 WGU OAs I took were high quality in my opinion. The questions were well written and really required understanding of the material. \\n* The 2 certs I got were nice I guess, but I don't think they move the needle when it comes to looking for a SWE job.\\n* Use chatgpt to help you learn! Don't use it to cheat, you really only end up cheating yourself. It can be such a great tool for learning though. It got me through a lot of very dense topics.\\n\\n  \\nWas it worth it?\\n\\nFor less than $5k all in, getting this degree was absolutely worth it. I'm counting it as less with the $1000+ student discounts on random things I was able to get as well lol. Who knows with this job market, but I know I am a better engineer now with all this new knowledge. Most of the classes were relevant enough, and while the course materials may not be the best, most OAs and PAs are set up in a way that allow you to learn well if you want. \\n\\nI also have a degree from a B&amp;M, and I have to say I really like this learning format. The depth you get is also far superior compared to any bootcamp out there. I'm not the most disciplined. I have a DSA coursera class from years ago that is perpetually stuck on chapter 1, but not having to pay another $4k was plenty motivation for me to get this done. \\n\\nIf you got to this point, thanks for reading my humongous brain dump. LMK what student discount I should take advantage of before graduating, and AMA!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Completed MSCSIA (Masters in Cybersecurity) in 40 days - it was challenging, not for everyone, many more would drop out, most would graduate in 1 year\\nI know, many hate to see such posts, but give me a chance. I'm in my mid-40s, have good IT background going back to high school (including programming in C, if anyone remembers that), have several small kids, work full time, and already have a Ph.D., as well as an undergrad from top universities (nationally and globally). \\n\\nSo going into this, I had many questions: WGU is radically different from anything I am used to - not making me comfortable.\\n\\nKnowing that CI's don't have any power and everything is evaluated anonymously, raised a lot of suspicions on my end.  \\n\\nReading horror stories about Examity didn't exactly inspire me. \\n\\nThe external camera requirement seemed like they were really going overboard. \\n\\n\"Will I have the time?\" That was a huge question, along with \"Do I really need this?\" These two questions underpinned everything for me. Basically, unless I could do this accredited and ranked degree in one semester, especially since I was paying for it myself, it was not worth it for me. \\n\\nHowever, I decided to take the plunge and transferred 3 classes due to already having CISM and CASP and other cyber certifications. I could have transferred 5 classes, but I decided to take CySA and Pentest while at WGU: it's cheaper that way plus I learn more. So I had to complete 7 remaining classes. I thought to myself: as long as I spend about 2 weeks per class, I should be able to do it in less that one semester/term. I need to complete everything before March ideally, since I have some major training for a different great program starting then.\\n\\nSo I start on Dec 1, but immediately get knocked down by an RSV from my youngest kid. As a result, the first 3 days are wasted laying in bed and being unable to concentrate. Very sad mood. So that took a lot of steam from under me, and now I got worried - Winter just started, and I was already down. \\n\\nPlus, now kids had a major change in schedule their coaches insisted on - they would now require more training time with their sports since they would be competing - which means I would be a part-time taxi service for them. So I had to read a lot of the WGU materials in the app, while sitting in the car with the heater on and off. As a note, I read all WGU materials, watched all videos, did half of all the labs, and read some of the books or chapters they assigned as optional reading. So I did not do what other accelerators do, which is go straight to the OA/PA. My goal was also to learn or refresh my skills somewhat, but certainly without exerting myself and without learning something completely from scratch (which is why I would not do a Masters in Computer Science, as I just don't want to learn some programming language - I know and understand enough of that, and won't be a programmer ever).\\n\\nOK, now started the first class, and followed the directions in one of the labs which said it required a paper, with screenshots. I did it, and proudly submitted to CI, only to find out that actually that lab in that class was not required at all - it was optional. So I wasted one (1) precious day of reading, following instructions, and writing a paper that was unnecessary. One day for me is significant - I'm a working adult. In one day I typically accomplish a lot. \"What a 'great' start!\" I am thinking to myself. \"Did you really need THIS? You don't have enough things in your life, you needed a 'challenge'?\"\\n\\nFinally, I got that class out of the way, and now felt better: I did it in less than the 2 weeks I allotted to myself per class. Now let's start the second and third classes - which require CySA exam and the Pentest exam. CySA was not hard for me since I already had more advanced CASP+, but Pentest+ was quite hard. I was really challenged, I thought it would be in the same league as Security+, but in reality, it's almost at the level of CASP+, and harder than CySA+. Thankfully, I prepared and refreshed my memory for a few days, and was familiar with Comptia exams. Otherwise, I don't know if I could have passed it on the first try. But getting vouchers, and then scheduling these exams takes time (I had to wait for 5 days for my CySA exam between scheduling it and actually taking it, for example, as Comptia was very busy in mid-December, before the holidays). After passing my exams I had to wait another 3 business days for exam results to be posted and classes to officially be completed. Without that, my mentor, who was not very experienced, was scared to allow me to register for more classes. The 2-days of weekends always had a negative effect as well, since it seemed like I submitted my papers or passed my Comptia exams on Friday's, thus having to wait longer (WGU allows 3 business days for grading, so in effect that could be 5 days with weekends).\\n\\nAnyhow, now I was done with 3 classes, and felt much better, but while waiting for these exam results, I started my 4th class, after convincing my mentor to allow me to take it - and submitted the paper that required me to use their incident response template. The \"originality report\" did not show the results of the check for over 24 hours, and I just went ahead and submitted it without it. The evaluator kicked it back, accusing me of plagiarism, since the checker ended up showing that the paper was 50% \"similar.\" I was still not familiar with all WGU processes, and it took me a while to understand how to navigate and read their evaluation reports, as well as \"similarity\" reports. I understood that the evaluator was totally inexperienced and forgot to exclude the text of the template from the checker - thus of course my paper was \"similar\". Then the names of the people, the names of the machine, the IP addresses -- all of this unavoidable and required information was also \"similar\" and evaluator forgot to exclude. \\n\\nSo now I have a crisis on my hands - I have a black mark on me and thanks to the incompetence of the anonymous evaluator I'm in deep trouble. I start remembering my initial hesitation with WGU precisely because of these anonymous evaluators and tell myself, \"See, you were right to think and predict this, but you didn't listen to yourself! Now go and waste your time dealing with this lemon!\" And dealing I did: I wrote protest emails to two officials at WGU, with a detailed analysis of what happened and what their evaluator did wrong. I called their assessment team and could barely contain my anger, explaining what happened. The lady on the line was very sympathetic to what happened, and felt like she understood the problem, but could only refer it to the anonymous evaluators, whose names and phones she doesn't have. I was very angry, and mentor was not helpful. But the next day an assistant dean wrote to me, said they investigated, agreed with me, accepted the paper, and removed the black mark from my name, clearing the record (yes, once you are accused of plagiarism they keep tabs on you). \\n\\nWhile I won, this wasted at least another working day from me, and caused a lot of stress I didn't need or deserve. As I mentioned earlier, I am very sensitive to even one wasted day. But now I completed 4 classes, and had just 3 more remaining, including Capstone. I'm thinking to myself - OK, I'm doing well, it looks like I can complete the degree in 30 days total.\\n\\nSo I started D485 -- and hit a brick wall. While I was trying to understand the requirements of this class' assignment, I asked to do D487, which I completed in a few days. But now all I had between me and the Capstone was D485. Calling IT help desk, or the student services, or mentor, or even CI, didn't help. Everything I found online was somewhat helpful, but not a lot, and nothing could bypass the need to learn Azure. Which I really didn't want to, since we use AWS, things change too quickly (case in point: Azure renamed Active Directory to Entra ID just a few months ago, while lab still shows AD), and I'm in the management. I paid my dues sort of speak, and don't need to be a sysadmin or cloudadmin Level II. I understand it enough, I really don't need to create RGs in Azure. But to pass this class it was essential, and I forced myself to watch everything there was. Since having work, kids, sports, etc., it took me 4 days to watch Pluralsight and read Azure's own training, and since the lab doesn't save the results and is slow, I had to go in, and redo settings 5-6 times.   \\n\\n\\nAbout CI's: the CI tried to be helpful, with tips and cohort recordings (and same is true of all other classes, where CI's try to be helpful, but are really limited on what they can do. Indeed, they are probably as helpful as any professor in any online program in most universities). So I really liked the CIs, but they are severely limited. That's something WGU must change in the future if it really wants to become a Top 50 university.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well. But I was able to start Capstone basically after NY, it took them 1 day to approve Task 1, then I submitted Task 2, and it was kicked back, since I didn't understand - as it's not really in the requirements - that I have to write as if my company has been hacked, i.e., there was some kind of a cyberincident. That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well. But I was able to start Capstone basically after NY, it took them 1 day to approve Task 1, then I submitted Task 2, and it was kicked back, since I didn't understand - as it's not really in the requirements - that I have to write as if my company has been hacked, i.e., there was some kind of a cyberincident. That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day. It took mentor 2 days to submit paperwork for graduation.  \\n\\n\\nSo the end result: I am glad I took the plunge, and did this quickly and on budget. It was definitely not easy, had I been 20-something, it would have taken me the full 6 months, even though I was sharper, faster, and had boundless energy back then. I'm slower, and can't concentrate anymore, but I'm also smarter, more focused, methodical, and disciplined (not much social life helps). It was definitely worth it for me because of this, and thank you to WGU for creating and maintaining a regionally accredited degree that's ranked high and keeps improving, with strict anti-plagiarism measures and external cameras to nip critics in the bud and maintain the value of the degree. I say this despite being a victim of the unprofessionalism of one particular overzealous evaluator, or having many other things I could criticize. This program is on par with programs at most other universities (except the most select).   \\n\\n\\nThus, I did it in 40 days, would have done it in 30 days, and if I knew WGU processes and was luckier, then maybe even in 20 days. **But** I also know that less than 1% can complete a degree quickly, and for every such accelerator there are 10 who drop out, and 90% who finish on regular schedule. It was a challenging program - Capstone was not easy but super fun nevertheless (that's the geek in me), D485 I will remember forever (I hated it, but hugely respect it and will always tell this story to my kids), and other classes that required you to draw network diagrams or do Examity proctored exams, made it very challenging, since had to learn new skills or refresh long-forgotten Visio skills, and had very little direction and explanation from WGU. Yet there was no need for busywork, no unnecessary stretching of the program or overloading the student with 10 books per class. So it's perfect for a working professional, who doesn't have the time of the 20-something full-time student (or even part-time student -- you guys, if you think you are \"busy\", wait until you marry, have kids, senior position at work, and other social obligations).   \\n\\n\\nI would love for WGU to make a few improvements, so I could take another degree or two from it:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1) give CI's more power, and make them assistant professors at least. Let them publish research. This will improve rankings. And allow students to pair up with professors to publish research jointly, based on the capstone project.\\n\\n2) anonymous evaluators are not cool. I get the perceived need for that, but WGU should not be CIA.\\n\\n3) update the curriculum! (The OSI model is ridiculous, for example, and has always been controversial. It is unnecessary when there is a TCP/IP model which is actually used. Where is anything on blockchains? Crypto? Adversarial AI/ML? Post-quantum cryptography? SD-WANs?) Yes, it's not bad compared to other universities, but compare yourselves to Georgia Tech, MIT, Johns Hopkins, etc. This will improve the ranking further.\\n\\n4) require papers for every class. Even if these classes have Comptia exams.\\n\\n5) clarify all requirements and put them all in one document. Please don't say \"they already are.\" No, they are not. We can test it - WGU officials in charge should write a paper, and submit to me, and see what will happen.\\n\\n6) Mentors have too much power at the expense of the students. A lot of WGU students are working adults. We should not need to ask permission to register for classes. I should be able to start 4 classes at once if I want. It's my risk, my transcript, my life. And I paid for it already. \\n\\n7) Gain more and better accreditations for IT, Business, and other colleges and programs. \\n\\n8) Allow students to enroll in two programs at once - for example, IT and nursing. Not dual degree, but keep them as two separate programs, two separate degrees. Just allow them to be taken concurrently, not \"finish and graduate from one, and only then start the second one\". Again, we are adults, we know what we want and what we can. Every month and every day matters for us. If I finish/graduate on September 6, it means I can only start my studies in a new program at WGU on November 1. But if I would have been able to graduate by September 5, I could start on October 1. Just one day, and such a huge effect. \\n\\n9) Improve the orientation class. Right now it's very long and cumbersome. Make it shorter, and have a clear \"quick start\" guide that has everything we need on it. Right now everything is clunky, orientation is a waste of time, and for some reason it pollutes our transcripts, by being listed on it as a zero-credit class. Totally unnecessary to include zero credit, non-academic \"course\" which is not a course on it. \\n\\nSo recruiters and HR reading this: this is a very legit degree, that's more challenging than most others, yet can be had in a matter of weeks, not a year like others. Graduates of this program actually learn smth, and can do things, unlike most graduates of other programs who learn theory and would quickly forget or get confused within weeks of graduation. \\n\\nThank you all, this forum and its members have been great.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

If you’re considering starting the program or are already enrolled and wondering how to move forward without burning out, this should help. I’ve listed the key resources and tips I used below so you can jump right into what works.\\n\\n[My Overview Video of the Entire Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_pH7zEMrDs)\\n\\nWGU uses a **competency-based model**, which means you move through the courses by showing that you understand the material, either through writing papers or passing exams. There are no weekly classes or fixed schedules. You set your pace. Some people finish in six months. Others take a year or two. It depends on how much time you can realistically commit.\\n\\nThe coursework ranges from relatively easy to genuinely challenging, especially in areas such as accounting and statistics. But there’s no fluff. Every course has a clear structure, and if you follow the rubrics and use the resources, you can get through it. The biggest challenge isn’t the content—it’s staying focused and pushing yourself to keep going.\\n\\nThis program isn’t for everyone. If you prefer a more structured, traditional classroom environment, it might not be the best fit. But if you want something flexible that doesn’t waste your time, and you’re ready to put in the effort, the **WGU MBA** can be a solid option.\\n\\n# ORA1: Orientation\\n\\nWhat it takes to pass: One performance assessment (study plan + reflection) This is just a basic intro course to help you create a weekly study plan and understand the WGU format. It’s not challenging and most students finish in under an hour.\\n\\nDifficulty: Very easy\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n* Orientation takes 1 to 2 hours, not 6 to 8\\n* Complete 9 short units with readings and videos\\n* At the end, write a 1-page paper answering 5 questions (1 sentence each)\\n* Fill out a study schedule table with 40 X’s (20 hours total)\\n* Follow Unit 9 instructions to download, complete, and upload the paper\\n* Check the rubric in the student portal to confirm requirements\\n* Submit the paper to complete orientation\\n\\nYouTube:[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuyFx-4xF64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuyFx-4xF64)\\n\\nStudy Guide:[ https://adamvaluckas.com/wgu-ora1-orientation](https://adamvaluckas.com/wgu-ora1-orientation)\\n\\n# C200: Managing Organizations and Leading People\\n\\nWhat it takes to pass: Two performance assessments (papers) This course focuses on leadership styles and organizational management.

Use every tool at your disposal: Grammarly, APA templates, your instructors, and the community. If you stay focused and methodical, you can absolutely finish in one term, or two if you need more space. But also, if it takes you two-years that is totally cool!\\n\\nYOU GOT THIS, you 100% can do this. All it takes is time and effort. If you can put in several hours most days, you can do this in one-term. Remember, you can extend one course (the capstone) for a total of seven months.\\n\\n100% Free, no signin Study Guide: [The (Unofficial) MBA Study Guide for WGU](https://adamvaluckas.com/the-unofficial-mba-study-guide-for-wgu)\\n\\nMy YouTube channel with WGU MBA videos: [https://www.youtube.com/@AdamValuckas](https://www.youtube.com/@AdamValuckas)\\n\\nConnect with me on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaluckas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaluckas)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Confetti and tips\\nI just got my confetti!  The wait between filling out the graduation application and getting the confetti felt like the longest wait in this course (5 days). I started 1/1/25, so this took me just over three months.  Honestly, it could have been quicker, but I work full-time, have a house, wife, 2 young kids with activities and birthdays, dog died…etc.\\n\\nI wanted to give everyone here some insights and tell you about my experience to hopefully answer some of questions of people who are considering this program.  I should start with a little about me because everyone has their own path and learning style so YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).\\n\\nI am just into my 40’s, I completed my Associate’s from a local community college in 2018, and I my bachelor's degree last year (2024) from Charter Oak State College.  Despite my higher education coming largely later in life, I’m also the guy that took calculus because it was interesting and Coursera’s Google Data Analytics certificate for fun.  So later when I say, C207 was actually fun for me, now you know why.\\n\\nI am a paramedic by trade, but I’m in management now.  One important aspect of my job is writing detailed and professional investigation reports about employee and emergency incidents.  This helped greatly in all of my college writing.  One thing I really appreciate about WGU is that the papers were very content driven as opposed to feeling like a test on how well I use APA format.\\n\\nWith all of that said, your path is your own.  In the words of a popular song from around the time I graduated high school, “The race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.”\\n\\nBefore I move on to talking about general tips and class specifics, I do want to address one item: WGU is awesome.  I don’t know what the qualifications are of calling it a “degree mill” and I really don’t care.  Unless it is a top 7 MBA school (Yale, Harvard…) then it just doesn’t matter which school you get your MBA from as long as it’s accredited.  For those who ask “What do you really retain when you are going that quickly?”  The answer is “A lot!”  This is very applicable to my career and goals.  I’d also tell them that I remember almost nothing from my Art History class that was a full 15-week semester in-person class.  The people who have some experience can move quickly, the people who don’t have incredible resources to succeed.  I explained it this way to someone: If your boss found out that you completed a project to full industry specifications ahead of schedule and under budget, how valuable did you just make yourself?\\n\\nTo be fair, there are some negatives.  Despite my earlier comment about the papers, I don’t feel the papers are as rigorous as I would have expected for a Master’s program.  They felt much more like writing essay answers on a test than a cohesive, well supported, college-level paper.  Also, it happened twice where I got a paper returned for revision a second time for something that passed successfully on the first submission and wasn’t changed.  Typically, it was the “professional communication” item because the evaluator just ran it through Grammarly and decided there were too many “correctness” errors. \\n\\n**General Tips and resources:**  \\n  \\nThe “Course Search” link in every course is available before you start any course as are the Pre-Assessment Quizzes.  This was great for me in late December before my classes started and while waiting for paper submissions to be evaluated.  I would open the next course and have full access to any recorded lectures and task videos.  It allowed me to work ahead when I could.  Also, if I felt comfortable, I was even able to take the PA’s prior to the class opening.\\n\\nI found Studuco to be very helpful.  There are condensed study guides to several classes that I would review before an OA.  Also, there were times when the rubric wasn’t very clear on exactly what was expected in the paper.  I found it very useful to see how others tackled some sections of their work.\\n\\nI took all of the PA’s twice to ensure that I started to grasp the material I missed and that the overall score was improving.  In some of the classes, there were also end of chapter quizzes that I could take and often would.\\n\\nChatGPT.  I never have AI write for me, it’s against my own personal ethical code, but it is still an amazing resource in other ways.  It can recommend scholarly sources, it can evaluate your paper against a rubric, it can clarify some concepts the course material isn’t clear on, and it can further explain why one answer is the correct one on the Pre Assessment questions. \\n\\nEveryone asks if the PAs and OAs are similar and yes, they are, for all courses.  In general, I found there to be three variations. \\n\\n1. The questions are exactly the same (rarely).\\n\\n2. They utilize different numbers or data.  This also applies to the non-math classes.  It would be along the lines of the PA asking which law was violated in this scenario vs the OA giving you a different scenario and therefore needing a different correct answer.  \\n\\n3. The OA questions are reflections of PA questions.  For example, the PA might ask: You have 10 total items in your shopping cart, 5 are apples, the others are oranges, how many oranges do you have?  Whereas the OA will ask: You have 10 total items in your shopping cart, 5 are oranges, the others are apples, how many apples do you have?  This also applies to the non-math courses as well.\\n\\n**Course Specifics:**\\n\\nC200 – Easy class.  Two papers, both about 10 pages including title and reference page.  I did have the first paper returned for revision because I just straight up missed a section on the assignment / rubric.  Resubmitted and passed without issue.  My only advice for this class is when you are choosing the leadership style to discuss, take a quick look over the leadership style course materials to ensure there is enough material to work with on the compare / contrast areas. (1/1/2025 – 1/7/2025)\\n\\nC202 – Easy class as well.  I am very familiar with HR practices and law because it was a fairly extensive class in my bachelor's degree and I work with HR very closely in my position.  This was my first OA.  I took the PA for this course in late December before my classes officially began in January.  I used some of the condensed study guides on Studuco before taking the OA and had an exemplary pass. (1/1/2025 – 1/3/2025)\\n\\nC204 – Easy class.  Two assignments, one which involved a recorded presentation.  I don’t feel that I did a good job speaking in the presentation but passed anyways.  I recorded myself right on power point and then uploaded it to Panopto to get a submission link.  Studuco helped here because I was confused about how much I needed to invent possible solutions and how thoroughly I needed to support their benefit.  I would just advise you on these to keep it simple.  Two passes, no revisions. (1/1/2025 – 1/12/2025)\\n\\nC212 – Now this class was completely new for me.  At no point in my professional or educational career have I come across marketing.  I started by reading the material and watching what videos I could.  Eventually, I decided it was better to just start writing and learn as I go rather than learn the material, then write.  This actually worked out pretty well for me.  I developed my concept and product; I wrote the introduction and then learned each section as I was writing it.  I did have to look at Studuco a few times to understand how others were approaching some of the tasks.  Obviously, I needed to customize my response and approach for my product, but seeing what others had done helped greatly.  This was a long paper, passed first time. (1/12/2025 – 1/20/2025)\\n\\nC206 – I choose to do this class before the math / accounting classes because I wanted to group my classes with papers vs my classes with OAs.  This was a relatively easy class, but I found the papers to be annoying and relatively uninteresting.  The course videos were a wonderful resource on these and my primary method of learning and writing for the paper.  I did get a revision on the second task of three because the ethical dilemma I chose was about terminally ill kids and defective toys.  Apparently, this was regarded more as a business decision than a personal ethical dilemma.  I still call BS on that, but whatever, I ended up changing it to a coworker stealing money and passed task 2.  On task one, I needed a revision on further defining the difference of two ethical perspectives.  I found the evaluator’s comments to be a little unclear.  I gave ChatGPT my paper, the assignment, the rubric and the evaluators comments to help me understand where my paper was lacking.  The problem was much clearer after that.  I used the course material and revised my work.  Passed on the second revision.  (1/20/2025 – 02/02/2025.  Unfortunately, my 10-year-old German Shepherd died in during this period, which for obvious reasons slowed my progress down).\\n\\nC213 – Medium difficultly class.  I felt ready for this class because of my affinity for math and other comments… This class had very little to do with me doing math.  It was mostly a naming convention and memorization course, you have to know how money is categorized in each statement.  A calculator was useful for some intermediary calculations, but any calculator would have worked.  This was the only OA I recommend having a whiteboard.  For this class, I mostly watched the videos in the course search twice and at 2x speed.  Exemplary pass.  (2/2/2025 – 2/12/2025)\\n\\nC214 – I enjoyed this class.  It was more focused on the business / financing side rather than the exact accounting side.  I do believe taking this class back-to-back with C213 was beneficial.  Again, I watched the videos under course search twice at 2x speed.  If you know excel, you’ll have no issues.  I actually really like the format of the PA and OA and I didn’t need the business calculator.  Exemplary pass.  (2/12/2025 – 02/22/2025)\\n\\nC207 – The class everyone fears / hates.  I actually had fun in this course.  I have an affinity for data analytics and found the material interesting.  The course layout does need some help, but the course search videos were very helpful.  Again, watched those twice on 2x speed.  I took the OA pretty quickly and passed, the essays though gave me a little trouble.  This was one of those courses that one of my papers got returned twice.  The paper required some clarity on some of my answers.  I found the feedback to be valid and was able to revise and resubmit.  It got returned again for things that I didn’t change and weren’t an issue on the first submission.  This was very frustrating.  The second paper wasn’t an issue and passed first time.  ChatGPT was helpful in the areas that the text and materials didn’t explain well, such as the differentiation of concepts like incidence, prevalence, etc.  (2/22/2025 – 3/3/2025).\\n\\nC215 – My current job title is Operations Manager.  This class was a prime example of the power of competency-based education.  I watched the videos again at 2x speed.  There were some supply chain concepts I wasn’t familiar with, but overall, this class was my bread and butter.  Exemplary pass on the OA (3/3/2025 – 3/6/2025).\\n\\nC211 – This class was difficult.  It wasn’t the concepts as much as the extreme narrow margin of only 50ish questions on the OA.  I enjoyed the material, but it wasn’t laid out well.  The videos were boring and didn’t cover as much material as I would have preferred in relation to the OA / PA.  I found some study guides on Studuco which were very helpful.  I passed the OA on the first try, but it wasn’t by comfortable margin.  (3/6/2025 – 3/10/2025)\\n\\nC216 – This capstone really slowed me down.  The simulation was fun, but there was a lot more to it than I expected.  There were 3 papers required in this course, one of which comes with a presentation you give on the first 3 quarters of your company.  I watched a couple YouTube videos of other presentations which gave me a sense of how deeply I needed to go into certain topics and how much information to put on each slide.  I recorded myself in power point again and uploaded it to Panopto to get a link for submission.  The first task was returned because one of my financial decisions was actually an investing decision – fair enough.  I didn’t have to redo the entire presentation, I just needed to add a single slide (without recording) and presentation notes just for that one slide.  By the way, I was told that I needed to submit this paper / presentation and then immediately press submit on the simulation.  I was told that it needed to be done in this order because otherwise I would lose access to the information I needed for the presentation, and I would be locked out until my paper passed.  I’m not sure if this was a fluke or a change in the program, but I wasn’t able to submit my Q4 until the paper passed.  I wasn’t able to move on, but I could go back and make all sorts of changes if I wanted.  I was worried that something was wrong, and I was going to have to contact IT, but after my paper passed, I was able to finally submit Q4 in the simulation and everything was fine. \\n\\nThe second paper and third paper were submitted within hours of each other.  Both needed revisions.  The third paper needed specifics on how past concepts helped me in the simulation - fair and easily corrected, passed on the second attempt.  The second paper was another frustrating one.  The first revision needed some clarity on the impact of my actions, and I needed to actually spell out the math on the earnings per share.  Again, this was fair and easily corrected.  This attempt was again returned for professional communication which really irritated me because that wasn’t a problem in the first submission.  The evaluator even specified that there were too many errors on the “correctness” area on Grammarly.  Fine. I ran it through Grammarly and made the corrections, some of which I found to be more stylization preferences than actual corrections.  Resubmitted and passed.  (3/10/2025 – 4/1/2025). \\n\\nAll-in-all, this was an incredible experience.  I am truly grateful for this style of learning and college.  WGU allowed me to work at my own pace, leverage my skills and experience to learn and progress at a speed I’m comfortable with.  Seeing my progress and hearing the good things I had to say about WGU, wife is actually starting soon because she gets a contractual raise for having a second masters.  I wish everyone here all the best and thank you guys for the amazing advice and community on r/WGU_MBA</td>\n",

       "      <td>Kevin Pineapple's B.S. IT Review\\nHey everyone!\\n\\nFollowing in the footsteps of many others--notably u/jwawa and u/wotanwolf, I'd like to offer my writeup on the BS IT program through WGU, and how I completed those classes. I completed it within 1 term, only transferring in 21 credits from completion of certs prior to my start at WGU.  A little background about me: I work full-time as the sole IT analyst for a major healthcare company in their downtown office full-time M-F. Most of my time during waking hours was either work, study, or both permitting downtime.\\n\\nI also want to mention this: There have been several courses where I failed the OA, and had to retake it. That is not because the course itself was difficult, but rather I was under prepared and didn't take the time to slow down and comprehend it properly. \\n\\nI highly recommend both jwawa's and wotan's guide, as they were my motivators to succeed:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/88nnpw/jwawas\\_it\\_course\\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/88nnpw/jwawas_it_course_notes/) (jwawa), [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/8izjot/wotans\\_bs\\_it\\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/8izjot/wotans_bs_it_review/) (wotanwolf)\\n\\nIn addition to their wonderful guides, I also used an excel spreadsheet made by  [u/berge472](https://www.reddit.com/user/berge472/)  located here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/62lb59/course\\_progress\\_tracker/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/62lb59/course_progress_tracker/); I used this as a means of motivating myself over time, and to show how far I've come.\\n\\nStart date: 5/1/2020 | End Date: 9/25/2020\\n\\n**My Courses**\\n\\n* **Introduction to IT (c182) - 05/01 - 05/02**:  \"A mile wide and an inch deep\" should be the motto for this class. If you have sufficient knowledge on computer hardware and best practices you can easily complete this in a day. Study-wise, I only went through the Pre-Assessment once, then went straight to the OA.\\n* **Critical Thinking and Logic (c168) - 05/05 - 05/05**: Another fairly easy class, this goes over the general concepts of critical thinking, and does not go any further. I took the pre-assessment to see where I stood, and based off what I was weak in (was a few sections), I then read the course material. Afterwards I retook the PA, got a good score and then took the OA.\\n* **Introduction to Communication (c464) - 05/03 - 05/06**: Fairly similar to c168 in terms of the course just generalizing concepts of communication, and the types of communicators. This class is the only one of it's kind (for my program) to require a video PA, in addition to the OA. I completed the OA before performing the PA which is split into 2 tasks: the first is a paper report on an academic topic of your choice, and the second task is a video recording going over that paper. Panopto was the system used to record myself. My advice here is to have 2 screens: 1 with a script and the other showing your video recording.\\n* **Applied Probability and Statistics (c955) - 05/06 - 05/10**: This course wasn't too bad, I worked off of the areas I was weak in based off of the PA using the UCertify practice tests, and re-took the PA again and got a higher score. The PA and OA align closely together.  For this and the other 2 math classes I solely used my Casio FX-CG50 (great calculator!)\\n* **Applied Algebra (c957) - 05/11 - 05/12:** This course is alot easier if you're coming right out of c955 as you carry over some of the fundamentals easily. I used the practice exams in UCertify and took the PA before going for the OA. Fairly straight forward.\\n* **Finite Mathematics (c277) - 05/13 - 05/16:** Boy do I really hate Truth Tables. Nothing I could find help cement the theory of it until I came across this beautiful person on YouTube that explained it for me to finally understand it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMC-ttjhwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMC-ttjhwM)\\n* **Natural Science Lab (c683) - 05/19 - 05/19:** OK this is hilariously easy. You need to write on a natural science experiment and observe the changes made introduced by your original hypothesis. An example is comparing the melting rate of ice between water, oil, and salt water. Again, very very easy.\\n* **English Composition II (c456) - 05/19 - 05/21:**  English is my favorite course of study, and I already had prior experience in writing literature papers so this went by easier for me. This course only has 2 PA's; The first task is to create an thesis statement and a bibliography using 8-10 sources in APA format. I used [https://scholar.google.com/](https://scholar.google.com/) to locate my articles, and [https://www.citationmachine.net/apa/cite-a-website](https://www.citationmachine.net/apa/cite-a-website) to quickly format my source websites into APA format, then paste them into Word. The 2nd task is the actual paper regarding your argument. At this point you're just reiterating what you stated from the 1st paper.\\n* **Integrated Physical Sciences (c165) - 05/22 - 05/25:** This is the first (of many) OA that I failed, mostly attributed to my own hubris and believing I was ready when I really wasn't.  For my 2nd attempt I went through the course material and did the knowledge checks, quizzes, and used the following Quizlet in Learn mode to make sure I was drilling it down: [https://quizlet.com/376991990/integrated-physical-science-c165-wgu-flash-cards/](https://quizlet.com/376991990/integrated-physical-science-c165-wgu-flash-cards/)\\n* **American Politics and the US Constitution (c963) - 05/26 - 05/30:** I disliked the course material, was too dry for me to stay focused and keep my ADHD in check, so I discovered this amazing series called CrashCourse, that had a video playlist going over U.S. Government and Politics ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H))--best of all it was engaging! Highly recommend. This, in addition to the PA was my sole source of preparing for  the OA.\\n* **Introduction to Humanities (c100) - 06/01 - 06/02**: This course was fairly easy. The OA is slightly more difficult than the PA (pre-assessment) but still links up properly in what it's asking of you. It focuses heavily on the major themes throughout history and the figures in them. Know this, in addition to works of art and buildings and you'll be golden. The PA (Performance) is a report on a work of art or figure from a pre-determined list. \\*STRONG HINT\\* The classical period is well-documented ;)\\n* **Technical Communication (c768) - 06/03 - 06/04:** This is the little brother to the Capstone, as it contains 2 PA's: The first task is to write up a request for proposal (RFP) for a company that implements a solution using technology. The second task is to then actually create the proposal itself. The rubric is your friend with this paper. Again, I used Google Scholar for my sources, and the citation machine website for APA formatting.\\n* **Emerging Technologies (c850) - 06/04 - 06/04:** While I was waiting for my PA's in c768 to finish evaluating I started on this class. Compared to the previous class, this is a cake walk. This has 1 PA in which you propose (see a pattern?) an emerging technology as a solution to a fictional organization. Use the case study attached in the course to determine your method of proposal as there's many solutions to choose from based on the case study.\\n* **Cloud Foundations (c849) 06/8 - 06/10:** The first of many certifications.  UCertify was my only source of study material as this is the general concepts of cloud networking. CompTIA likes to make all their foundational certs a mile wide but an inch deep. Know the fundamentals and services (Iaas, SaaS, PaaS), the types of cloud (Private, Public, Hybrid, Community), and you'll be golden.\\n* **Data Management - Foundations (c175) 06/14 - 06/16:** I hated reading about databases then, and I still do now.  I highly advise you to avoid UCertiy and utilize the videos from LinkedIn Learning, much easily digestible. You can also watch Caleb Curry on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0j0QN2b57M&amp;list=PL\\_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0j0QN2b57M&amp;list=PL_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID)) and still come out fine.\\n* **Data Management - Applications (c170) 06/17 - 06/20:** Remember how I mentioned my dislike for databases? Well it showed here. I failed both of the OA's on the first go.  My 2nd attempt I used UCertify, and drilled home the labs in the UCertify material. The labs in the material is the *exact* same as the Lab OA, save some name changes. I cannot stress this enough. The multiple choice OA was tough, but as long as you do the quizzes in UCertify you should be fine.\\n* **Spreadsheets (c268) - 06/22 - 06/23:** Watch this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Ppltu3wbU&amp;feature=youtu.be) video and enjoy that easy 100%. The OA is the exact (exact) same as the PA. Did I mention it's eerily similar?\\n* **Ethics in Technology (c961) - 06/24 - 06/25:** This class boils down to \"Is this legal or ethical?\". Once you understand the distinction between the two and go through the PA, the OA will be  an easy one.\\n* **Information Systems Management (c724) - 06/26 - 06/27:** Similar to the above class, only it goes into the business side of IT. The PA, and UCertify quizzes are your friends.\\n* **Scripting and Programming - Foundations (c173) - 06/29 - 06/30:** If you have any fundamental knowledge of scripting, this class can be done within 1 day. The UCertify practice test is a great tool to use to nail down some of the concepts in relation to programming.\\n* **Web Development Foundations (c779) 07/01 - 07/09:** I failed the OA on the first go due to my lack of preparedness. On my 2nd attempt, I solely used the practice tests in UCertify and read through any chapters where I had gaps in knowledge.\\n* **Network and Security - Applications (c178) 07/13 - 07/25:** This course is for the Security+ exam. For almost all of the certification exams I used sources outside of WGU. For this course, I used [Professor Messer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy) and several practice tests that you can find online for free.\\n* **Business of IT - Applications (c846) - 07/27 - 08/01:** This is for the ITILv4 certification. I used the official ITILv4 app ([Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.tso.itilfourfoundation&amp;hl=en_US)| [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/official-itil-4-foundation-app/id1446263720)) in order to  pass this one.\\n* **User Interface Design (c773) - 08/04 - 08/08:** This course is for the CIW - User Interface Designer certification exam. I followed [jwawa's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/7wn4l5/c773_user_interface_design_completed_wstudy_notes/) down to the end and was able to pass on my 1st attempt.\\n* **Organizational Behavior and Leadership (c484) - 08/10 - 08/11:**  If you have some experience and/or knowledge of how a company functions, this should be easy. I took the PA and used it as my source to improve in the areas needed. PA is somewhat similar to the OA. I encourage you to at least read a few chapters (it's dry unfortunately).\\n* **Web Development Applications (c777) - 08/12 - 08/16:** Basic HTML knowledge is sufficient enough to pass. If you're new to HTML, use the UCertify material and definitely use the practice exam mastery mode to hone it in.\\n* **Business of IT - Project Management (c176)  -  08/17 - 08/27:** This course is for the CompTIA Project+ certification. I followed along to [jwawa's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/7yofa3/c176_project_management_completed_wstudy_notes/) for this course and was able to pass without an issue.\\n* **Principles of Management (c483) - 08/31 - 09/01:** Fairly easy course, just go through the competency videos located in Course Tips and you'll be golden.\\n* **Linux Foundations (c851) - 09/02 - 09/19:** I underestimated this course and failed on the first attempt by 1 question.  On my 2nd attempt, I had a VM instance of Ubuntu ready, and followed along to everything (and I mean everything) that Sean Powell did in the UCertify videos. I also read chapters I struggled in and did the practice tests, and was able to pass on my 2nd attempt.\\n* **IT Capstone (c769) - 09/21 - 09/24:** I honestly am not sure how I pulled this one off. I already had an idea in mind for my capstone back when I first enrolled into WGU as I had recently completed a project at work that fit this course perfectly. The first task is simply getting the topic approved by your mentor and submitting it. Task 2 is the proposal for the topic, and task 3 is the status-report after the project was completed. Task 2 took the longest out of the 3, and surprisingly task 3 was easy since you're cutting a lot of your work from 2 -&gt; 3. I made sure to look at the Capstone Model and Excellence Archives as a reference for those that completed it in how they presented their reports.\\n\\nWGU has been a great experience for me, and even now writing this out feels like a dream! There were days where I didn't want to keep going and take a day off, but I held true to my goal of getting it done; Even when I failed my OA's, I became more determined to succeed. My schedule has been roughly the same since I enrolled: I work 7:30 AM - 5 PM M - F, but wake up as early as 4 AM to get a head start on some course work.\\n\\nThe only advice I can give is to breathe. There are going to be moments where you feel like you can't go on anymore, but I promise you, you can get to the other side and get that degree!\\n\\nOnce again I want to thank u/wotanwolf and u/jwawa from the bottom of my heart: You guys inspired me to return to school, and to finish it within 1 term. Thank you guys.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Transferring in 63.11% of my BSCS - A Review / Guide to Sophia, Straighterline, and study.com\\nI’m beginning my BS Computer Science next month, in April 2023.  I work full time study part-time.  I began working on third-party courses in September 2022 so I could transfer in as many credits as possible in order to minimize the number of terms needed at WGU.  I got my transfer credit evaluation back a couple days ago, and since I transferred in a *lot* of credits from third-party sites (namely study.com, Straighterline, and Sophia).  Here is the master list of every course I’ve taken between September and now, reviews and thoughts on each, how they transfer into WGU, and how much it all cost me.\\n\\nBut first, a little more context / background about me: I’m American and live in the US.  I have a BA in art history - spent about ⅞ semesters of this degree planning on going on to law school afterward and becoming an attorney, then spent my last semester abroad and ultimately decided “Oh wait! I actually *don’t* want all that debt! And I want to live abroad! And the thought of taking the bar makes me feel physically ill!” I don’t have any formal IT/tech experience, but I’ve always been “into” computers in my free time growing up so IT/tech/software was never completely out of the question, and before anyone says it, for me it’s not some desperate grab for money after ending up with a BA in art history.  I don’t have any debt from said BA as I was awarded a full ride (hence my growing distaste at the thought of taking on debt for law the closer and closer to that time I got), and I landed a great job at a regional food bank.  Definitely have no regrets (apart from not starting out as a CS/ArtHistory double major to begin with (and spending a year studying French instead of using that time to get better at Spanish)) as art history not only made life have so much more beauty and meaning than before, it’s just not what I want to do forever.\\n\\nMy job paid well enough for me to pay for all these third-party credits “as I go,” and I should be able to do the same with my WGU term(s).  I think I’ve saved myself at least a full year’s worth of WGU classes with these credits though, and saved several thousand dollars at the same time.  I **highly** recommend transferring in as many credits as you possibly can.  The BSCS has a **lot** of opportunities to transfer credits in, which means more time to study more relevant material on your own.  Anyways, without further ado, here’s what I’ve worked on the last few months:\\n\\n**Executive Summary**\\n\\nTotal number of credits transferred in:\\n\\n* 3 credits from Sophia\\n* 3 credits from Straighterline\\n* 8 credits from study.com\\n* 10 credits from my BA\\n\\nTotal cost:\\n\\n* $99 at Sophia\\n* \\~$400 at Straighterline\\n* \\~$800 at study.com\\n\\n**Sophia**\\n\\nJust a quick note about this platform.  When you sign up, you’re given the option to select from a variety of subscription options.  I went for the one month / $99 one (for people who “want to work quickly through one or two courses”), and I’d planned on only completing two courses because I read that as though there’d be a cap on the number of courses you could take in that month.  There’s not actually a limit - you can just have up to 2 courses active at one time, but if you can finish courses in a matter of hours then this is not a barrier at all.  Go for this cheapest option, and grind out as many as you can / need.  No exams are proctored, and they’re all (officially) open-book.  Don’t waste your time and money using this platform for more than 1-2 months.\\n\\n\\*\\*You can see how credits transfer from Sophia to WGU [here](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Transfer.aspx?iid=1385&amp;institution=Sophia%20Learning%20LLC)\\n\\n*Web Development Fundamentals*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 0/10\\n* Time to complete: &lt;1 day\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Almost embarrassingly easy, actually.  There are just 3 units, each with a few required quizzes and a very slightly larger unit quiz.  After that there was one “final” which was only like 20 questions.  That was the entire course: no actual web development required.  I’ve completed FreeCodeCamp’s responsive web design class which is more of what I would imagine an introductory web dev course should be like, but Sophia was easy credit I guess.  Finished this one in a couple hours, and it only took that long because it can get tedious grinding out multiple choice quizzes.\\n\\n*Principles of Management*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 0/10\\n* Time to complete: &lt;1 day\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Slightly more involved than web dev fundamentals, but still really easy.  Thank God I wasn’t actually trying to *learn* anything from Sophia or I would’ve definitely felt like I got ripped off.  (Granted, there is actually a lot of material to read and comb through, but it’s not required to do well on the quizzes, which is what I was here for.)  Great for the super easy and cheap credit, but you get what you paid for.  This class had 4 units instead of just 3, and it required a presentation at the end.  Presentation is super easy, you just have to make a PowerPoint and they even give you a template of what exactly to put on each slide.\\n\\n*Project Management*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 0/10\\n* Time to complete: &lt;1 day\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Once again, almost too easy.  About on par with Principles of Management, minus the PowerPoint.  If WGU’s project management course (and by extension, the CompTIA Project+ certification) are something you’re actually interested in learning, don’t take it at Sophia.\\n\\n**Straighterline**\\n\\nThis platform is pricier than Sophia, and I just took courses here because I kept seeing it’s the best (read: easiest) platform to take calculus on.  The Intro to Programming in C++ course was actually really good, and calculus was in fact not too painless, so I’d recommend this platform just for those courses.  Taking anything else isn’t necessarily worth the cost, as Sophia is the cheapest option as you’re billed monthly, and study.com is a comparable price per course but minus the monthly subscription.  Straighterline charges a $99/month subscription fee plus you have to purchase each individual course, so it’s the most expensive option of these three but of course it could be worth it for some courses.\\n\\n\\*\\*You can see how credits transfer from Straighterline to WGU [here](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Transfer.aspx?iid=130&amp;institution=Straighterline)\\n\\n*Intro to IT*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 4/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Not a bad course actually.  There’s enough content to challenge you if you’re actually looking to learn (in this case, I was), and enough unit quizzes to ace to give you a lot of padding when taking the proctored final.  No project or anything, just 8 unit tests and a final exam.\\n\\n*Calculus I*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 5/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~1 week\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * This is the primary reason I bought into this platform: for cheap and easy calculus credit.  I was decent at math *in high school*, but there’re about 6 years and a liberal arts degree between then and now, so you can probably imagine most of that decency has been lost.  And frankly I don’t have the time nor the desire to re-teach myself math from algebra I on upward, so I followed Reddit’s advice and got a good calculator, a TI-Nspire CX II CAS (*very* cheaply on an eBay auction), learned how to use it well, and went to work.  Be careful using CAS calculators at WGU though as they’re against school policy.  The only remaining “math” class I have at WGU is Discrete Mathematics II, and from what I’ve heard and read, just a TI-84 will suffice.  The course was just exams - no homeworks, projects, anything like that - and only the final was proctored.  There’re enough unit exams that you can make As on them and have a very nice safety net for the proctored final.  Also, Chegg is your best friend.  Pay the $20 and get a month’s subscription.  It’s beyond worth it.  Lastly, if you think you’re bad at math or that you wouldn’t do well at calculus: take it from me, it is possible.  I finished the course with an 87.  You just have to take full advantage of the resources available and you can succeed.  Don’t let calculus be the barrier between you and your BSCS.\\n\\n*Intro to Programming in C++*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 6/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~2.5 weeks\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * I actually learned a lot from this course.  Going into it, I wasn’t really expecting anything useful, but I came out of it feeling like I had a decent grasp on introductory C++.  Previously, the only languages I’d played around with are Python and HTML/CSS/JS.  This course took you through Zybooks (don’t crucify me for saying I actually learned a lot here), and the interactivity was very helpful for me.  Only complaint really is that there wasn’t a *ton* of writing your own code; the exercises were mostly fixing pre-written code or writing comparatively small sections of code.  It takes some effort to get through, and putting in said effort isn’t really optional in this case.  I actually *enjoyed* this course, and didn’t feel like I was just mindlessly clicking through shit.\\n\\n**Study.com**\\n\\nYou have the most course options on study.com, but it’s not super cheap either; it’s $200 for a month’s access, and that includes 2 final exam attempts.  For most courses, you’ll have an assignment/project to complete as well as the proctored final exam before you’re granted credit.  You can take a maximum of 5 final exams each month, and after your second one each exam costs $70.  So to maximize a month’s subscription, you’d take 5 final exams in total, which would cost $200 for the first two plus $210 for the extra 3.  The courses are generally fairly long and there’s a lot of content available to learn, so it’s a decent resource for learning but also for getting cheap credit transferred in.  I would recommend knocking out as much as you can with Sophia, then filling in the holes with Straighterline (if you need calculus) and then study.com for as much else as you can.\\n\\n\\*\\*You can see how credits transfer from study.com to WGU [here](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Transfer.aspx?iid=1218&amp;institution=Study.com)\\n\\n*Discrete Mathematics*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 5/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 weeks (but *should’ve* been like 2-3 days)\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * I say it should’ve been 2-3 days because I took this course before figuring out how to properly fudge study.com’s quizzes to get the maximum possible grade, so I ended up with a not-so-great overall quiz grade (because I rushed through them all) and had to try *really hard* on the final.  Most of study.com’s courses are weighted 100/100/100 (quizzes, assignment(s), final) but this one was just 100/200 (quizzes, final).  I generally divided up a course into 3 days: 1 to do all the quizzes, 1 for the assignment(s)/project(s), and 1 to take the final.  If you play your cards right, you can get near a 100% on the overall quiz grade, giving you a fair cushion to rawdog the final should you choose to do so.  YouTube and Github both have some great resources for helping you get through projects, too.  This advice stands for the rest of the study.com courses actually.  You get 3 chances per quiz to improve your grade, so definitely make the most of that.\\n\\n\\*Note on the database courses: as u/Confident_Natural_87 pointed out in the comments (and I forgot to include originally; my bad), there's a ridiculous amount of overlap between these three courses.  Once you finish Fundamentals, you'll have already completed about 40% of both Programming and Management.  And once you've finished Programming, you'll be about 80% done with Management.  So these three courses go back really quickly once you finish the Fundamentals, and it's not difficult anyway.  There's a *lot* of content to go over, but given all that overlap it's definitely not as daunting as it my initially seem.\\n\\n*Database Fundamentals*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Database Programming*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Database Management*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Introduction to Networking*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 4/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Intro to Cybersecurity*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: 1 day\\n\\n*Data Structures &amp; Algorithms*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 6/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Artificial Intelligence*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 2/10\\n* Time to complete: 2 days\\n\\n**tl;dr**\\n\\nHere’s a list of the WGU courses I received transfer credit for from my BA:\\n\\n* C455: English Composition I\\n* C464: Introduction to Communication\\n* C768: Technical Communication\\n* C100: Introduction to Humanities\\n* C961: Ethics in Technology\\n* C963: American Politics and the US Constitution\\n* C255: Introduction to Geography\\n* C955: Applied Probability and Statistics\\n* C683: Natural Science Lab\\n* C165: Integrated Physical Science\\n\\nAnd Sophia:\\n\\n* C779: Web Development Foundations\\n* C176: Business of IT - Project Management\\n* D194: IT Leadership Foundations\\n\\nAnd Straighterline:\\n\\n* C958: Calculus I\\n* C182: Introduction to IT\\n* C173: Scripting and Programming - Foundations\\n\\nAnd study.com:\\n\\n* C959: Discrete Mathematics I\\n* C949: Data Structures and Algorithms I\\n* C836: Fundamentals of Information Security\\n* C175: Data Management - Foundations\\n* C170: Data Management - Applications\\n* D191: Advanced Data Management\\n* C951: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\\n* C172: Network and Security - Foundations\\n\\nAnd, lastly, the courses I have remaining to take at WGU:\\n\\n* C846: Business of IT - Applications\\n* C867: Scripting and Programming - Applications\\n* C482: Software I\\n* C195: Software II - Advanced Java Concepts\\n* C188: Software Engineering\\n* C857: Software Quality Assurance\\n* C191: Operating Systems for Programmers\\n* C952: Computer Architecture\\n* C960: Discrete Mathematics II\\n* C950: Data Structures and Algorithms II\\n* C964: Computer Science Capstone\\n\\nHope this helps!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Summary – Data Management Applications (D427) – Passed in 44 days (X-post from r/WGU)\\nHey y'all. I just passed D427 yesterday morning (March 1) on my first attempt and thought I would get my obligatory write-up out of the way. This is probably going to be my longest write-up yet and creating these resources took a few hours, so I hope they help out.\\n\\nTo preface, I had almost zero SQL knowledge as I got an easy transfer for D426 - Foundations. Overall, in hindsight, I would say that this class was not too challenging and was actually kinda easy. I know I took 1.5mo to finish it but once again, like in my last class (C777), I had a mix of procrastination and personal things come up. When I actually actively started to learn the material it was around Feb 1st so overall it actually took me 29 days.

My aim is for it to aid you in understanding core concepts useful for both the Multiple Choice and Performance based portions of the exam. Please don't waste your time going through the exorbitance that is the ZyBooks content.\\n\\n# My Approach\\n\\nDue to me starting with essentially no SQL experience and very little knowledge on relational databases I began by trying to learn the basics about what each statement does and some of the foundational knowledge. After trying the dreaded ZyBooks out at first I decided that I should just jump directly into the learning actual Syntax and how to write statements. Based on recommendations from this sub, this is the general path that I followed before taking the Pre-Assessment:\\n\\n[SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) \\- Every day (for about 2 weeks) I would try to do about 1-2 of the 18 total lessons, restarting at the beginning each day so that I could test myself on if I could remember the syntax. I would say this took the longest, even though in hindsight the statements were actually quite simple. I think that this was key to building up a good foundation for the level of syntax knowledge you need to know for the OA. Throughout the time I took on SQLBolt, part of it was asking ChatGPT questions about the syntax, like why I could do this but not this, what does the correct syntax for 'X statement' look like, etc. By the end of the 2 or so weeks of hitting SQLBolt, I could do over half of the exercises with no references.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql) \\- I took this course (1 day) to fill in more gaps when it comes to basic SQL, to test myself a little bit, and to keep reinforcing the syntax. Overall a great resource. Make sure you sign in using SSO with WGU. At this stage in my learning, the only thing I couldn't really do in this course was the CREATE VIEW statement.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql) \\- I took this course (1 day) to learn some things that weren't covered in SQLBolt and for the same reasons for the Intro DataCamp course. I learned a lot about WHY I used certain statements which was very important (mostly from ChatGPT). Some of those things include using things you probably WILL need to know for the exam like COUNT(), WHERE, GROUP BY, DECIMAL() and things you probably WON'T need for the exam like HAVING, ROUND, WHERE IN, DISTINCT+COUNT, LIKE. Still a good resource for reinforcement, though. Also, I only used double quotes until this point, make sure you ONLY use single quotes.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Joining Data in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql) \\- I DID NOT ACTUALLY COMPLETE THIS. I felt like I already had a good understanding of JOINS (you probably only need to know AND understand; INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN for the exam).\\n\\nSQLBolt - I returned to SQLBolt on 2/26 and needed reference on 8 total exercises, then came back 2/27 and only needed reference on 5 total exercises, then came back 2/28 and didn't need ANY reference for the exercises and could figure EVERYTHING out on my own. This was a big part of my success.\\n\\n[SQL-Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/) \\- This is a great resource as well, PLEASE use it. It took me only 1 day to get through this and I think it was very crucial to my success. Again, it helped with reinforcement and the biggest part of the exam IMO, which is actually understanding what statements to write based on what they are asking for. I only did the easy questions using the hospital theme. IMO you DON'T need to do the medium or hard questions as they go a little too deep for the what exam requires you to know, but it couldn't hurt.\\n\\n# Pre-Assessment/ZyBooks Labs\\n\\nSo on 2/27, the same day I couldn't do 5 of the exercises from SQLBolt without reference, I decided to take the Pre-A to see where I was at. [THIS](https://gyazo.com/041a2e83323fcad71deb8127a433d8d6) is my coaching report and I got about \\~39%. Pretty bad but I just couldn't do most of the statements outside of SELECT. For the MC questions as well, I saw some things I really didn't know anything about, but still got most of them correct by using common sense. This included the sublanguages (DML, DQL, etc.), VERY BASIC Cardinality, knowing which columns to use for PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY, and VERY BASIC Referential Integrity.\\n\\nI skimmed through the ZyBooks content (1, 2 ONLY, if that) and only fully completed some of the areas where I thought I may need more information on. I just actually wanted to look through the course content as I had neglected it prior. Overall I'd say this didn't really help me too much.\\n\\n**THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST THING THAT CONTRIBUTED TO MY SUCCESS (2-3 days):** one thing I did take from the ZyBooks content, however, was that it would show you EXACTLY how each statement should be structured. I took screenshots of them, and asked ChatGPT to essentially create ones for the ones ZyBooks was missing and it looked somewhat like [THIS](https://i.gyazo.com/bf607a23361b307fbcd117b747e83d74.png). From here, since I had an issue REMEMBERING how to write the statements in the moment, without reference, I would go through the list of file names, open a .txt document. And write a notional statement from memory. This plays on Rote Memorization a little bit but it works. If you can't remember that CREATE INDEX is \"CREATE INDEX index\\_name ON table\\_name (column1, column2)\" then just keep trying to type it from memory until you get it, only using the reference .png when you need it. I probably wrote hundreds of statements in just a couple days. If you want more information on how I did this process, let me know and I try will explain further and deeper.\\n\\nAfter doing this, I ran through the section 8/9 labs ONCE and ONCE only and could get through 90-95% of them without issue or needing reference. I then took the PA on 2/29 and [THIS](https://gyazo.com/939eb41e25f4bf012d4af259512b6dfb) was my coaching report. I got a 100%, but took it with a grain of salt as this was the THIRD time I had seen these questions. But nonetheless, I felt like I was ready for the OA.\\n\\nIf you get 100% on the PA, don't even bother taking it again. It only works to an extent as a method for testing, which is why I suggest not taking it AT ALL until you feel you are close to ready (this includes the CH8 labs).\\n\\n# The Exact Things I Studied:\\n\\nMy idea with this section is to tell you EXACTLY what I studied to get the score I did. Hypothetically if you study these exact things, you will pass as well. This course could benefit from a study guide that lists the statements and knowledge you need to know, but there isn't one as far as I am aware. The one provided by the CIs is very lackluster, IMO.\\n\\nHere is the [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) to my Imgur Album which contains every statement I studied for and what the CORRECT SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE. If you can write that statement with notional information with NO reference, you will be good for that specific syntax. The only one I didn't include that I studied was UNSIGNED, make sure you know that too.\\n\\nAlso, just skim through the labs and think to yourself, \"what are they asking me to write?\" Then, just pop off answers until you can figure it out. You should be able to IMMEDIATELY tell what the question is telling you to do. I.E.; \"Write something to create the BEANS table\" should connect in your brain with \"CREATE TABLE.\" This is also where the SQL-Practice resource I mentioned above can help. \\n\\n# The OA\\n\\nI felt that I was ready for the OA after taking the PA the final time and wanted to test the same night, but decided to let the information marinate in my brain for another day, so I waited until the next morning after some light study.\\n\\nI only took 41 minutes and at the time, I thought I was going to score at least 90%. I was super confident in my statements and MC answers but I was quickly humbled by my score after I refreshed the assessment page for 10 minutes and actually saw how close I came to failing. I am not proud of my score one bit, but a pass is still a pass and I get to put SQL and this course behind me for good.\\n\\nI only verified/checked half of my queries using SELECT \\* and DESC, making sure to remove those verification statements and run the code again without them. For some reason my programs would take 15-20 seconds to actually run, so during that time I would just re-read the question multiple times and look at my code to make sure I am doing exactly what they asked for. This led to me opting not to verify half of my statements due to the false confidence. This may have led to me almost failing, so please, actually take your time to verify EVERY statement you write and then go through them again to make sure at least run each statement again, without the verification statements.\\n\\nAs for overall OA difficulty, the OA is almost literally the same exact thing as the PA. Even down to sequencing of questions for which are MC and which are statements you must write. Obviously it isn't exactly the same but what others have preached about the exam rang true for me, and probably will for you as well. I really just think I probably answered most of the MC questions incorrectly and miswrote 1-3 statements and didn't verify them, but we will never know.\\n\\nTo regurgitate a little bit of information everybody else also says, to reinforce some consensus; if you can 100% the PA with no reference (without studying the answers), you will be totally OK, don't let the OA psych you out.\\n\\nI would say the biggest challenge of the exam to overcome is figuring out what the hell the question is asking you to do, and what you need to write to make that happen. To my understanding, as long as you can return exactly the information they want, you will be fine. So if you cannot figure out how to do something the way they probably want, but you can do the exact same thing in a different way, you will probably be okay. \\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe course can be intimating at first, especially for how shitty it is organized. I wish I had something like the [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) I just created to help me to know exactly what I needed to know, and a half-decent [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub). I seriously think that if you just follow my resources linked here then you will be good for the PA/OA.

Based on recommendations from this sub, this is the general path that I followed before taking the Pre-Assessment:\\n\\n* [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) - Every day (for about **2 weeks**) I would try to do about 1-2 of the 18 total lessons, restarting at the beginning each day so that I could test myself on if I could remember the syntax. I would say this took the longest, even though in hindsight the statements were actually quite simple. I think that this was key to building up a good foundation for the level of syntax knowledge you need to know for the OA. Throughout the time I took on SQLBolt, part of it was asking ChatGPT questions about the syntax, like why I could do this but not this, what does the correct syntax for 'X statement' look like, etc. By the end of the 2 or so weeks of hitting SQLBolt, I could do over half of the exercises with no references.\\n* [DataCamp - Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql) - I took this course (**1 day**) to fill in more gaps when it comes to basic SQL, to test myself a little bit, and to keep reinforcing the syntax. Overall a great resource. Make sure you sign in using SSO with WGU. At this stage in my learning, the only thing I couldn't really do in this course was the CREATE VIEW statement.\\n* [DataCamp - Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql) - I took this course (**1 day**) to learn some things that weren't covered in SQLBolt and for the same reasons for the Intro DataCamp course. I learned a lot about WHY I used certain statements which was very important (mostly from ChatGPT).  Some of those things include using things you probably WILL need to know for the exam like COUNT(), WHERE, GROUP BY, DECIMAL() and things you probably WON'T need for the exam like HAVING, ROUND, WHERE IN, DISTINCT+COUNT, LIKE. Still a good resource for reinforcement, though. Also, I only used double quotes until this point, **make sure you ONLY use single quotes**.\\n* [DataCamp - Joining Data in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql) - I DID NOT ACTUALLY COMPLETE THIS. I felt like I already had a good understanding of JOINS (you probably only need to know AND understand; INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN for the exam).\\n* SQLBolt - I returned to SQLBolt on 2/26 and needed reference on 8 total exercises, then came back 2/27 and only needed reference on 5 total exercises, then came back 2/28 and didn't need ANY reference for the exercises and could figure EVERYTHING out on my own. This was a big part of my success.\\n* [SQL-Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/) - This is a great resource as well, PLEASE use it. It took me only **1 day** to get through this and I think it was very crucial to my success. Again, it helped with reinforcement and the biggest part of the exam IMO, which is actually understanding what statements to write based on what they are asking for. I only did the easy questions using the hospital theme. IMO you DON'T need to do the medium or hard questions as they go a little too deep for the what exam requires you to know, but it couldn't hurt.\\n\\n# Pre-Assessment/ZyBooks Labs\\n\\n* So on 2/27, the same day I couldn't do 5 of the exercises from SQLBolt without reference, I decided to take the Pre-A to see where I was at. [THIS](https://gyazo.com/041a2e83323fcad71deb8127a433d8d6) is my coaching report and I got about \\~39%. Pretty bad but I just couldn't do most of the statements outside of SELECT. For the MC questions as well, I saw some things I really didn't know anything about, but still got most of them correct by using common sense. This included the sublanguages (DML, DQL, etc.), VERY BASIC Cardinality, knowing which columns to use for PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY, and VERY BASIC Referential Integrity.\\n* I skimmed through the ZyBooks content (1, 2 ONLY, if that) and only fully completed some of the areas where I thought I may need more information on. I just actually wanted to look through the course content as I had neglected it prior. Overall I'd say this didn't really help me too much.\\n* **THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST THING THAT CONTRIBUTED TO MY SUCCESS (2-3 days)**: one thing I did take from the ZyBooks content, however, was that it would show you EXACTLY how each statement should be structured. I took screenshots of them, and asked ChatGPT to essentially create ones for the ones ZyBooks was missing and it looked somewhat like [THIS](https://i.gyazo.com/bf607a23361b307fbcd117b747e83d74.png). From here, since I had an issue REMEMBERING how to write the statements in the moment, without reference, I would go through the list of file names, open a .txt document. And write a notional statement from memory. This plays on Rote Memorization a little bit but it works. If you can't remember that CREATE INDEX is \"CREATE INDEX index\\_name ON table\\_name (column1, column2)\" then just keep trying to type it from memory until you get it, only using the reference .png when you need it. I probably wrote hundreds of statements in just a couple days. If you want more information on how I did this process, let me know and I try will explain further and deeper.\\n* After doing this, I ran through the section 8/9 labs ONCE and ONCE only and could get through 90-95% of them without issue or needing reference. I then took the PA on 2/29 and [THIS](https://gyazo.com/939eb41e25f4bf012d4af259512b6dfb) was my coaching report. I got a 100%, but took it with a grain of salt as this was the THIRD time I had seen these questions. But nonetheless, I felt like I was ready for the OA.\\n* If you get 100% on the PA, don't even bother taking it again. It only works to an extent as a method for testing, which is why I suggest not taking it AT ALL until you feel you are close to ready (this includes the CH8 labs).\\n\\n# The Exact Things I Studied:\\n\\nMy idea with this section is to tell you EXACTLY what I studied to get the score I did. Hypothetically if you study these exact things, you will pass as well. This course could benefit from a study guide that lists the statements and knowledge you need to know, but there isn't one as far as I am aware. The one provided by the CIs is very lackluster, IMO.\\n\\nHERE is the [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) to my Imgur Album which contains *every* statement I studied for and what the CORRECT SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE. If you can write that statement with notional information with NO reference, you will be good for that specific syntax. The only one I didn't include that I studied was UNSIGNED, make sure you know that too.\\n\\nAlso, just skim through the labs and think to yourself, \"*what are they asking me to write*?\" Then, just pop off answers until you can figure it out. You should be able to IMMEDIATELY tell what the question is telling you to do. I.E.;  \"Write something to create the BEANS table\" should connect in your brain with \"CREATE TABLE.\" This is also where the SQL-Practice resource I mentioned above can help.\\n\\n# The OA\\n\\nI felt that I was ready for the OA after taking the PA the final time and wanted to test the same night, but decided to let the information marinate in my brain for another day, so I waited until the next morning after some light study.\\n\\nI only took 41 minutes and at the time, I thought I was going to score *at least* 90%. I was super confident in my statements and MC answers but I was quickly humbled by my score after I refreshed the assessment page for 10 minutes and actually saw how close I came to failing. I am not proud of my score one bit, but a pass is still a pass and I get to put SQL and this course behind me for good.\\n\\nI only verified/checked half of my queries using SELECT \\* and DESC, making sure to remove those verification statements and run the code again without them. For some reason my programs would take 15-20 seconds to actually run, so during that time I would just re-read the question multiple times and look at my code to make sure I am doing *exactly* what they asked for. This led to me opting not to verify half of my statements due to the false confidence. This may have led to me almost failing, so please, actually take your time to verify EVERY statement you write and then go through them again to make sure at least run each statement again, without the verification statements.\\n\\nAs for overall OA difficulty, the OA is almost literally the same exact thing as the PA. Even down to sequencing of questions for which are MC and which are statements you must write. Obviously it isn't *exactly* the same but what others have preached about the exam rang true for me, and probably will for you as well. I really just think I probably answered most of the MC questions incorrectly and miswrote 1-3 statements and didn't verify them, but we will never know.\\n\\nTo regurgitate a little bit of information everybody else also says, to reinforce some consensus; if you can 100% the PA with no reference (without studying the answers), you will be totally OK, don't let the OA psych you out.\\n\\nI would say the biggest challenge of the exam to overcome is figuring out what the hell the question is asking you to do, and what you need to write to make that happen. To my understanding, as long as you can return exactly the information they want, you will be fine. So if you cannot figure out how to do something the way they probably want, but you can do the exact same thing in a different way, you will probably be okay.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe course can be intimating at first, especially for how shitty it is organized. I wish I had something like the [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) I just created to help me to know exactly what I needed to know, and a half-decent [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub). I seriously think that if you just follow my resources linked here then you will be good for the PA/OA. Obviously only use them as supplemental resources, not replacements.\\n\\nIf y'all need any help on any of this stuff or you want some more refined materials from me, let me know and I'd be happy to oblige.\\n\\nI did C777 and D427 back to back to get the \"harder\" courses out of the way. I look forward to getting back to the \"real\" accelerating. Stay tuned for my C773 User Interface Design post soon.</td>\n",

I completed D333 early August but am only now getting around to doing my summary for it.\\n\\nGoing into the course, the recon I did nearly a year ago led me to believe this would be an extremely easy course, simply a case of studying up on a few key topics and applying common sense. The more recent recon I did back in early August revealed there was a ton of people who have struggled with this course, so it is obviously a bit more challenging and involved than I previously anticipated. With hindsight, this is mostly true, but the common-sense notion still is a key part of this course IMO.\\n\\nI recommend to enter the course under the perception that this class is at least moderately difficult, so you don’t become overconfident and potentially fail. It can and does go by fast though, when you focus your approach to the course material and key concepts.\\n\\n# My Approach\\n\\nSince this was a class with an OA, my original plan was to go through the course material in its entirety, taking notes on key terms and concepts, formulating those into flash cards, and eventually studying those flashcards until I had good enough active recall to pass the exam. I prefer this method over simply reading and studying notes as I just find it more effective in an exam context. I mostly stuck to this plan, but deviated by not going over the entire course content. If I had to guess I would say I only \"studied\" from about 5% of the total course content from the main textbooks.\\n\\nFor course material there are 12 “modules” derived individually from 2 textbooks; **C**omputing &amp; **T**echnology **E**thics (**CTE**) and **E**thics **i**n **T**echnology (**EIT**). Modules 1, 2, 4, 12 are from CTE. Modules 5, 6-11 are from EIT. It is easy to get overwhelmed with this course content but **you do not need to read all of it**. CTE is by far the more boring of the two and does not have summaries. I attempted to follow it but I admittedly dropped it fairly quickly. EIT is definitely more readable and has very effective summaries built into it which are \"good enough,\" IMO.\\n\\nThe first day, I skimmed most of EIT (mostly the summaries) then took the Pre-Assessment a few hours later. I did pass by about 5% or so which actually surprised me. I feel if I took the OA then I probably would have failed, as the OA is a bit harder than the Pre-A so, IMO, to be in a good place to take the OA you should aim for at least 80% on the Pre-A to have a reasonable margin of error.\\n\\n# Study Methodology\\n\\nBy far, the single most useful resource provided in this course is the [**Study Notes**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/Things%20to%20read/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read%2FD333%20study%20notes%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read) resource, which is simply a copy/paste of the summaries from the EIT textbook provided by the CIs. Honestly, I’m not even sure why the first textbook is included for this course, as the modules directly pertaining to it are entirely covered by EIT. I studied those chapters for CTE using EIT instead, so IMO it is supplemental at best. I think you would be fine completely neglecting CTE.\\n\\nOutside of that, I seriously believe that the **Study Notes** is all you need for course content, outside of covering a few other \"small things,\" which I will get too soon. Most of it is extremely relevant to the OA. I used the **Study Notes solely** as my main course material, going through the entire document and further summarizing it for my own notes/flashcards. This only took a few days (before studying/memorizing).\\n\\nI was going to complete the \"Study Guide\" but refrained as I thought it was unnecessary. If you are having continued trouble with the course content, I would suggest it, though. It just seemed a bit too time consuming for me and seemed unnecessary in my situation.\\n\\nThe [**Acronym Glossary**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB5F683B8-96C0-4546-9B9B-18F6C32480AB%7D&amp;file=Tech%20Ethics%20Acronym%20Glossary%20(highlighted).docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true) may also be a useful resource, but I didn’t use it. Also, these [**PowerPoint/Sway**](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e81CAA&amp;groupId=&amp;searchTerm=&amp;courseCode=D333&amp;rtn=/apex/CommonsExpandedSearch) presentations may be useful if you want a more intuitive way to study the course material (WIP).\\n\\nNext, I found [**this beautiful resource**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqHCZYMgKoKTQF4IXGoldfk_8aI8JaYq/view) provided by another reddit user outlining what EVERY law is about. Pay attention to the “token” section of the documents as it gives you a quick definition to remember for that law, which is IMO enough to differentiate between them based on the context you will be provided in the exam. Make sure you 100% study these. If you see ISAE No. 3402 on the exam, you should immediately be thinking of international audit reporting rules and not much else. In all, there are **47 laws** to study this way, and with the “token” terms they go real quick, I was able to get them down in about a day.\\n\\nThere are a couple more small things you need to study for to be prepared for the exam. [**Ethical Frameworks**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6094069C-C43F-4A21-96C1-F4B360DD0B86%7D&amp;file=TechEthics%20Frameworks.pptx&amp;action=edit&amp;mobileredirect=true) is one. It is very simple to get down, maybe even watch some [**Hank**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a739VjqdSI&amp;t=1s) on YouTube to get it down even better. I can assure you that you will have questions relating to this area on the exam. [**Here**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20watch%2FEthical%20Frameworks%2Emp4&amp;referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&amp;referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2E9c9f9847%2De702%2D4f5a%2D9c41%2D223728e805a3) is a video from a CI going into these ethical frameworks.  \\n\\nNext small thing on the agenda is [**Ethical/Legal &amp; Authorized/Intended**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B992CC5BA-2163-4F5E-9244-B05599B7236F%7D&amp;file=ethical%20legal%20authorized%20intended.pptx&amp;action=edit&amp;mobileredirect=true) style questions. Again, you will probably see this on the exam, and quite a few times at that. [**Here**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20watch%2Fethical%20legal%20scenarios%2Emp4&amp;referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&amp;referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2Eaa28805b%2D25a1%2D4e02%2Db23d%2D95471fa67a2c) is a video from a CI going into these types of questions.\\n\\nThe [**PAPA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utd_sn7EYts) model is another thing that you will need to study. This is the most ambiguous bit, IMO, so I will just provide definitions here to help out:\\n\\n* **Property**: Rights and ownership of information (For who owns it and how it can be used or distributed).\\n* **Access**: Right/ability to obtain and use information (Protecting it from unauthorized access).\\n* **Privacy**: Right of the individual to control the collection/storage/sharing of their personal information.\\n* **Accuracy**: Ensuring that information is correct/reliable/free from errors, for preventing misinformation or harm.\\n\\nThe final small thing is [**AI Bias**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/Things%20to%20read/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read%2FAI%2DBias%2Dand%2DFairness%2DTerms%2Dto%2DKnow%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read), and again, you will 99.9999%+ have questions on this. The article goes into enough depth, IMO.\\n\\nAll of this content I described above, I made flash cards for, and fully memorized each. You can slack somewhat on the course material, but not on these areas. I had about 19 flash cards for AI Bias but got it down somewhat quickly. I had \\~180 terms from the course material, 47 from the laws, and about 30 for these “smaller things.” ~~If you want the flash cards let me know. If enough people want them, I can start to set them up to be distributed as I haven’t deleted them yet~~. ***As of 2/1/25 I have recovered the flash cards and made them available for importing,*** [***HERE***](https://send.vis.ee/download/5d0a3cc728744636/#GMtA4ONkPuf1duoHK30NPQ) ***is the link for that. If the link expires, just DM me or leave a comment and I will send you a fresh link.*** \\n\\n# Final Pre-Assessment Attempt:\\n\\nFor my memorization, I only ended up studying 1/3 of the main course content “fully,” which means to the level of almost instant active recall. I 100% fully memorized the “small stuff,” however. After drilling the main course content for a couple days, I decided I would take the Pre-A one last time and decide to take the OA based on the results. I made sure not to review the questions/answers after my first Pre-A attempt, and I would encourage you to do the same so you have an adequate benchmark for readiness.\\n\\nI did make a great improvement over the first attempt, scoring \\~90% vs \\~80%, subsequently feeling pretty prepared for the exam. I immediately scheduled the OA for about an hour out and began skimming through the rest of my flash cards and hitting the laws and “small stuff” again and again until it was time.\\n\\n# The OA:\\n\\nThis was actually my first exam experience with the unnamed proctoring service (my post will get auto removed by the mods if I mention it), so that was interesting. No huge issues with them besides having to repeatedly take pictures of my workspace as it kept resetting for some reason. Also, I had to sign into WGU from the unnamed service's browser, and I use unique and secure passwords for everything, so I had to exit out of the browser, enter my password manager, copy it to my clipboard, then re-enter the browser and re-do the check-in process. Not the best or most streamlined experience but it still worked so… I guess it is fine. No major issue or horror story.\\n\\nFor the actual OA, questions were somewhat different to the PA. Some questions were very easy, others were way more difficult. When people say that you have 2 good answers and 1 best answer, they are mostly correct. If you know your stuff, you will know the answer almost immediately, otherwise you will be making informed guesses. There were a couple straight dumb questions in my case, however. They asked something extremely specific regarding a very popular vendor certification which I thought was way out of scope. Luckily, I have a networking background so I was able to immediately know what the right answer was by recalling peers’ experiences with the listed particular certifications from this vendor.\\n\\n68 questions total, 2 of which were survey questions (Something new, I think?). I ensured I took my time with the questions; I took about an hour for a minute per question and carefully reviewing my selections. It looks like I got about an \\~80% with the only area not being competent being “identifies interventions.” When submitting the exam, I wasn’t sure if I was going to pass, I thought it was going to be very close and could go either way, but I was surprised.\\n\\n[OA Results](https://preview.redd.it/dyx72tg87mqd1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=08d31de4a58a1d9048810b9ff9f8205bccce8a22)\\n\\n# Conclusion:\\n\\nAs long as you 100% study the “small stuff” I described above and at least are at least somewhat familiar with the course material from the EIT textbook, you will pass. I honestly think that is all there is to it besides having a little common sense. Even then, I could have done less and still passed so maybe you don’t even need to 100% the “small stuff.”\\n\\nAs always, if you need some help on the course, feel free to reach out.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: As of 2/1/25 I have recovered the flash cards and made them available for importing, [HERE](https://send.vis.ee/download/5d0a3cc728744636/#GMtA4ONkPuf1duoHK30NPQ) is the link for that.

I figured that I would pay it forward this morning with providing my experience of the WGU MSCSIA program and what it took for me to graduate in one term. I was intimidated by the unknown; however, when I finally got my footing, I was able to hammer down and complete the work. This will be a long review and I have incorporated some “Lessons Learned” from redditors looking for advice for completing the program.\\n\\nTerm Duration: August 2024 - December 2024\\n\\nGraduation Goal: I had established a tentative graduation goal of February 2025.  I was okay with spending a year to obtain this degree. I can honestly say that having a Program Mentor who was supportive of my plan was a major contributor in my ability to progress as efficiently as I did.\\n\\nBackground Education: B.S. Criminal Justice Administration and Management, Master of Public Administration, M.S. Occupational Safety and Health.\\n\\nCertifications: PMP, PMI-ACP, ASQ-CQE, ASQ-CSSBB, ASQ-CMQ/OE, and a number of other certifications that I thought would transfer but did not transfer over.\\n\\nWork Experience: 20 years of experience within the Military, Automotive, Medical (Medical Device and Information Technology Contracting), and Nuclear - Operations, Engineering, and Security industries. Currently employed with a National Laboratory as a Project Manager; and pursuing a career within the Software Quality Engineering and Cybersecurity fields.\\n\\nRefer to the attached photo for timelines for each course. If you do not like the language that I use to explain my experience, please feel free to use your vocabulary to substitute my swear words for a word to your liking…hahaha 🤷🏾‍♂️\\n\\nD481: Security Foundations -  First course of the term.  I had butterflies and anxiety in preparing for the certification.  I leveraged Thor Pedersen’s course on Udemy to get me help me understand the material. I wanted to complete this course before taking an international trip for work.\\n\\nD482: Secure Network Design - I took a little longer than I wanted to with this course.  I had to travel internationally for work once again.  I was able to study abroad during my morning workouts.  I leveraged Jason Dion’s Network+ Course.  The cohort video helped immensely as well.  I have Microsoft Visio experience and can say that it helped me in completing the diagram for this course. I had to revise my submission; however, it was an easy fix and I was able to resubmit and pass the second time around.\\n\\nD483: Security Operations - I took a domestic work trip during this period.  I decided to rewatch the Jason Dion’s Network+ course in addition to his CySA+ course and Andrew Ramdayal’s CompTIA Network+ course (This was the best course for me because Ramdayal provided practical examples with equipment as opposed to Dion just talking at the screen).  My Program Mentor reached out to me to check on me…hahaha…I told him that there was a method to my madness.  Also, it helps to have colleagues that are Cybersecurity professionals who provided the advice that understanding networking will make everything else easier. Passed the CySA+ course.  I submitted the PA and believe it was a first-time go.\\n\\nD484: Penetration Testing - I thought about kicking the can down the road regarding this course.  I started studying this course while in the D483 course so that I could get a headstart on the material.  I purchased a year subscription to TryHackMe and it was clutch.  I leveraged Reddit posts from the WGU Cybersecurity subreddit to help as well.  I was not the most confident going into the testing center to complete this course.  Throughout the entire test, I thought to myself “I am fucking failing this motherfucker” as I progressed throughout the entire test.  I finally arrived at the end and had to go through the survey which only adds to the anxiety of the exam.  I passed the exam with a higher score than I achieved on the CySA+ exam.  The PA part of the course was easier; however, I had to revise and submit a second time.  I didn’t mind and I had overcome the Penetration Testing Monster. Before starting this course, I spoke to my Program Mentor and asked if it was doable to complete this curriculum in one term after completing the PenTest+ exam.  He gave me confidence that most students are able to complete the curriculum at an accelerated pace after completing the required certifications. I took his word as the gospel and immediately hammered down to complete this rest of the curriculum.\\n\\nD485: Cloud Security - I will start by saying that this is the worst fucking course in the curriculum due to the lab environment.  I had to request additional time to complete this lab.  I didn’t even get to finish the entire lab and had to communicate this within my PA along with the proposed recommendations for the one of the subtasks within the PA.  I thought for sure that this motherfucker was going to come back for a revision.  To my surprise, it was a “first-time go” and I ended up receiving an award for the PA.  I was pretty happy about this one.  I liked the material but the lab fucking sucks. My Program Mentor warned me about this course being one of the courses that can cause headaches to students.  My advice is to watch the cohorts and be kind to yourself. \\n\\nD486: Governance, Risk, and Compliance - This course was one of the easier courses.  I believe that this course was a good course.  I also work in a heavily regulated industry (Nuclear) so I was able to knock this course out in days.  \\n\\nD487: Secure Software Design - I took the PA for this course and passed.  I figured that I would download the course materials and absorb the text book.  This is also a course that my Program Mentor warned me about.  I was able to pass the OA the first time.  This is the course where I discovered the Try Hard Security [HackNow] Discord channel (If I would have had access to this resource sooner, I probably would have been able to learn the material and finish faster…🤦🏾‍♂️).  \\n\\nD488: Cybersecurity Architecture and Engineering - I was excited about this course.  I was also in a groove to finish earlier than my tentative goal and decided to take the PA in the early hours (0130 -0300).  I failed the practice OA (I was literally falling asleep as I went through this practice OA).  I retook the practice OA and passed so that I could get the voucher.  The confirmation of the voucher email was followed up with an email from my Program Mentor ensuring that I learn the material as opposed to remembering it (Fair Point).  I took the OA and failed by one question.  I immediately emailed the Course Instructor with my plan to remedy the issue if he would let me take the OA again without having to go through the hoops of completing so many assignments to be able to test again.  The Course Instructor was awesome and immediately approved my request.  I studied the CertMaster Material in addition to Mark Birch’s guide (found within the course materials of the course - I believe the last section of the course that lists all of the labs, CertMaster material, etc.).  I took the OA again the second day in which I had a good feeling about it…After completing the OA, my results were not available for 24 hours.  I called Assessment Services twice within the 24 hours in which the first call yielded a response from the specialist stating that “results will be available within 72 hours after taking the assessment.”  I waited for my results to come and even lost sleep wondering about the results.  I called Assessment services the next day and a very helpful specialist went above and beyond to access my results and tell me that I passed this OA.  I was relieved due to the fact that I was working on my assignments for D489 and D490 (pretty much had them completed) and the D490 Course Instructor had approved my Capstone topic; contingent on me passing this course.  I had submitted D489 as well.  So you can imagine the anxiety from this course. I am currently studying for CASP+ examination in which I will taking in two days.\\n\\nD489: Cybersecurity Management - This course was one of the easier courses for me.  I have experience in Program and Project Management and I was able to complete this course within a few days.  I had to resubmit to provide clarity on one of the subtasks; however, this one was one of the easier courses for me.\\n\\nD490: Cybersecurity Graduate Capstone - The dreaded capstone…hahaha…joking…the hardest part of this course was the fact that my Course Instructor approved my topic without signing the Capstone Approval form (contingent on D488 and  D489 passing).  To increase complexity, the Course Instructor went on vacation and provided an email to the MSITCapstone address where the curse instructors would receive any of the project proposal topic request and would be able to approve. Be careful and make sure that you receive the correct email capstone email.  The course instructor provided the email on her away replies; however, she added an extra “s” to the email.  I kept sending my form to the address and I kept receiving a message saying that my message was not received (I add read/delivery receipts to every email that I send…just a habit and also as proof that I sent the email in addition of being able to receive notification of the recipient reading the email.).  My program mentor finally found the problem and thought that I just entered too many characters (I copied the email from the course instructor; however, I take full accountability for not checking and letting my impulsivity get in the way.).  Another professor reviewed the approval form and considered my project viable giving me the green light to submit task one (I had to wait a whole six days before being able to submit my task due to the email mishap…for fucks sake).  I submitted Task One  and it was approved (43 hours).  Luckily for me, I had been working on both tasks two and three while waiting the long six days and while I was completing D487 - D489.  After I received the passing notification for task one, I applied the final touches to both tasks two and three.  I also did my due diligence on the possibility of submitting the courses in at the same time in which there were mixed reviews on this matter.  After completing my due diligence, I decided to err on the side on inclusion by submitting both tasks two two and three at nearly the same time (42-minute time difference between two and three submittal).  I waited for the tasks notifications and constantly refreshed my “My Portal” homepage like a crack fiend waiting to get the newest crackrock in the 1980s…after 40 hours of waiting for that fix, I received notification that I passed tasks two and three. So if you want to submit at the same time, I recommend doing it while making sure that you write to the rubric ensuring that your shit is squared-away.\\n\\nFinal Words:  I enjoyed the program and the learning opportunities that WGU provides.  I know that people will knock the curriculum and that is okay.  I will tell you that this degree is not a “diploma mill” degree and you will need to be competent to be able to accelerate.  I put a vast amount of effort along with having two little children (four and three years old) and a demanding project management job that requires more time than I am able to bill my company for…hahaha…If you are a student that wants to take its time, feel free to do so.  If this post doesn’t apply, let it fly.  I have seen some post where some redditors get into their feeling about someone posting their experiences to the subreddit.  I am open to hearing from everyone’s experience regarding their journeys and will admit that I am inspired by them.  Believe in yourself and have confidence in your ability to figure things out.  Have a great day!</td>\n",

       "0   Tips for Accelerating Your MBA (or Not!) - Course Tips & Recommended Resources\\nLet me start by saying this. I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips & Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations & Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!  \n",

I transferred 50 credits and work full time (Non IT). Here are my thoughts. Very long read!\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Proof of Completion](https://preview.redd.it/4372ewij6r5b1.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b92d9611f3e8c135bf5b9ea582ef9d423b96d820)\\n\\n[Completed Progress Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/kcx3uvij6r5b1.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82c94084e66ec02294d3990bcebe5cc3bfd4c42a)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, there are a lot of grammatical errors in this. I know. I do not care because I’m too lazy to proof read and fix them.\\n\\nAnyways I finished this degree program in a little over 3 months (105 days to be exact) after transferring about 50 credits. I also work full time with some fairly demanding hours. I do not have any professional IT work experience, but I can navigate around a computer. I also just find the subject matter interesting. I did do the computer science program last year and graduated from that in 1 term in August of 2022. My plan was to go to grad school in Spring of 2023, but I ended up missing all my deadlines and had to wait and apply for Summer/Fall Semester of 2023. I did end up getting accepted to University of Illinois (Urbana Campus) Masters in Computer Science (Data Science Track) for Fall of 2023…which was a shocker because it’s a Top 5 school for computer science. Data science has always been my main goal, but I had all this time in between from when I applied to when the Fall semester would start. Cybersecurity was always on my list of things to learn, but I always had other priorities. Now that I had this gap of time that I could do whatever with, it was a good time for me to get into it. I originally thought about going the route of just doing certs because I already have a CS degree, but I would have just mostly done the same certs that WGU offers in their Cybersecurity program. It would have cost a little less than the actual degree, but still roughly in the same ball park if done in 1 term. Considering that I would be attaining the same certs anyways and the cost is comparable, I figure I might as well do the program and get the degree out of it as well, even though I would likely never use the degree on my resume (with exceptions) as CS “trumps” Cybersecurity. At the least, it helped me stay on track and in focus. I gotta be honest, I enjoyed it alot more than I did computer science and it really got me questioning what path I want to take in my future. I’m still going to grad school (it was a miracle that I even got excepted there), but I may defer to next year (University of Illinois allows that) as I’m thinking I want to take Cyber Security further and dive into different areas. Below is a recap of classes that may or may not help you.\\n\\nHowever, before I get into it, I would just like to point out that I have been working in the construction project management field for the last decade after I finished my first stint (of many) in college (civil engineering). Needless to say, those who are in the engineering/construction field live and die by the schedule so I have a habit of making a schedule for every significant (sometimes insignificant) things I do. I included the schedule I made for this program. I started in March and assigned myself durations to complete the entire program within 1 term and giving myself more weight to what classes I thought would be more demanding and vise-versa. This is the schedule that I would live by and you can see I was on track until I did my 4th class (Networks D325) which is when I started accelerating like crazy. The durations shown are my actuals and the grey bars you see in the gantt chart is my baseline schedule snapshot of what my original schedule was when I first made it. You can compare the 2 and see how much I blew my original schedule out of the water. Most of the classes were done much quicker than my projection. Capstone was the only one that took longer (only by 4 days). Seeing a visual of your progress helps keep you on track and is a motivating factor. I would suggest everyone put a schedule together of some sort.\\n\\n**IT Foundations – D316 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I never had a job in IT, I just grew up using a computer just like everyone else in this program. I felt alot of these questions were really basic questions and if you know your way around a computer you can probably answer most of them without heavy studying. That being said, even though it is a basic certification, I feel like I actually got alot out this course as it made me touch on things that I wouldn’t have otherwise yet is still good to know…things like differences between cpu architecture and differences in memory types, etc… stuff you don’t normally think about. I found those things to be quite interesting. The only PBQ I remember was having to simulate putting together 2 desktops, one being high performance and one being for general office use, you have to pick the right components for each desktop based on the parameters in the question. For studying I partially watched the Total Seminar Series to fill in gaps and did a few Messer practice exams. I also did practice questions from crucialexams dot com. That is one of my favorite resources. Check that site out if you do not already know about it. That was all that was needed.\\n\\n**IT Applications – D317 (17 Days…I didn’t actually spend 17 days on this course, I was inactive for 10 days)**\\n\\n\\- Part 2 of the A+ exam. I have a similar view to how I viewed “IT Foundations” (Part 1 of A+ exam). About the same difficulty as Part 1. However, alot of it seemed like it was common sense considering you didn’t just start using a computer yesterday. Many of the questions you can come up with the right answer by just logically using process of elimination. On my particular exam, it was heavy on questions regarding system tools and commands. Those were the things you are really going to want to pay attention to study for. For studying, I mainly only watched the Total Seminar Series and did some Professor Messer exams and crucial exams.\\n\\n**Legal Issues in Information Security – C841 (10 Days…had 1 revision to do)**\\n\\n\\- I didn’t read any course material. I just read what the assignment was and used outside resources to learn and fill any gaps that I had to complete the assignment. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. I had no interest in this class whatsoever and I just blew through the assignment in a few days. I could have certainly spent longer time and get in depth with the course material, but it just was not important to me and I opted to just get this class done as fast as possible. It is a very easy class if you want it to be.\\n\\n**Networks – D325 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Of all classes, this was one the most demanding for me and the most important. Networking is the foundation to everything in this program and it would behoove you take as much time needed to understand the concepts. I would encourage all of you to build some sort of homelab which can be done dirt cheap. Exam wise, it was difficult because of all the acronyms you need to remember which makes it unnecessarily difficult, but the questions themselves were not tricky and fairly straightforward except the PBQs which are nonsensical in how they are asked. In my PBQs I was asked to set up/configure a network and WIFI and was also asked to troubleshoot a network. The questions were pretty comprehensive across the board and there were a few questions on port numbers, OSI model questions (know what layer does what and what types of programs or hardware pertains to each layer), network topography, wireless standards and a bunch of questions on various plans/policies and a bunch of questions on command line utilities (learn these!). I also had maybe 3 questions on CIDR notation, but I did not have to compute anything. Again, know your acronyms! For this test, I watched the total seminar series, practice exams on crucial exams, a couple of Dion practice exams (only partially) and referenced Mike Meyers’ CompTIA Network+ Certification Passport Book. I really liked this book. His “all in one” book goes more in depth (I have it but didn’t read it much), but the Certification Passport book was much better to look up a topic and briefly read about it when going over things you need to go over. Watching the video series and then using this book as a backup was all I really needed. I did a few quick reviews on crucial exams to build some confidence.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity – C844 (3 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read any course material, I just went straight to the assignment and chipped away at it all day. I thought this class was useful as it gave you an introductory on how to use Wireshark and Nmap. Wireshark is a very cool program. Lots of features to analyze traffic. I did not read the course material for this class as the Nmap portion was easy to figure out without having to really look anything up, but for the Wireshark portion, I only watched the Udemy course: “Getting Started with Wireshark: The Ultimate Hands-On Course” by David Bombal. Excellent course and will provide you with all you need. This guy is very passionate about his Wireshark! I highly recommend this Udemy course and get as much as you can out of it. There are others, but this one was the best one that I was able to come across.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications – D329 (7 Days)**\\n\\n\\- This class is the class that requires the Security+. I found this exam to be fairly easy because there is a lot of overlap from Network+. Just like Network+ there is a lot of memorization of acronyms needed. I apologize as I don’t have much to offer on this because I don’t remember the specifics of what was on it. It is just kind of one big blur. I remember it being shockingly easy compared to Network+ like if you passed Network+ you could probably take this the next day and pass it after reviewing all the common types of attacks. For studying, I just watched the Security+ course on udemy by TIA Education, Andrew Ramdayal. He was actually pretty good, straight to the point on topics with no fluff. Probably not everyone’s “cup of tea”. Also, probably could have gone a little more in depth in some areas, but I would take this over Dion Training any day. Hell, I would take anything over Dion Training. Ramdayal strictly sticks to the objectives laid out exactly the way Comptia has their test laid out. It was easy to goto each one and pick the things you need to work on. I did no practice exams. Went straight to the official exam after I finished the video series. I do remember that one of the PBQs was setting up a firewall.\\n\\n**Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity – D431 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read the course material, I just went straight to the assignment and used outside resources and Udemy to guide me. I actually found this course to be quite fun. You will have (2) PAs and an OA to do. The first PA is that you have to create an investigation plan per best practices. The 2nd PA was fun as you will need to run a program called “Autopsy”, where you have to analyze a disk image and put a story together about what crime will likely be committed based on the evidence you found when doing your forensics. As far as the OA goes, know your tools, Windows/Linux/Mac log types and folder locations, what different parts of your Windows registry does and the various Federal Laws (critical). The preassessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty and style. That was really the only study aid I used.\\n\\n**Information Systems Security – C845 (10 Days)**\\n\\nYou will need to pass your SSCP for this one. I wrote a post on this class before. However here is a brief TLDR recap from my previous post on couple of things for you to remember:\\n\\n\\- The SSCP Practice Exam Book by Nick Mitropoulous is a fairly good representation of the exam and is the only thing I used.\\n\\n\\- This was an easier version of Security+. If you passed A+, Net+ and Sec+ than this exam will be fairly easy.\\n\\n\\- questions seem to be spread out evenly across the board for the most part, with the exception that there were very few questions on “cryptography” (I had maybe 5 or 6 that I can remember), but there were seemingly a bunch of questions regarding “identity access”. They weren’t difficult, but that section definitely had the most weight. Be sure you know the concepts behind the “who I am”, “what I know”, “what I have” principles as there were a lot of questions on that.\\n\\n\\- There were no trick questions and you don’t have to worry about remembering acronyms\\n\\n\\- Don’t psych yourself out. The most obvious answers are like the correct answers. There were no trick questions.\\n\\n\\- This is very important, read the question very carefully and really think about your answer when it comes to the “best”, “worst” and “most likely/unlikely” questions. These questions have multiple right answers so they can be kind of difficult. You have to consider how you are answering that question because you will get questions like “What is the best course of action in this (insert scenario)? Choose: A, B, C or D. Lets say the answer “A” and “B” are both definitely correct in the scenario, but choice “B” might be a step that you would do in part of step described in choice “A”. So the answer would be “A”. These are not trick questions, but you really need to think how answers integrate with others to pick the best choice. These questions were probably the most “trickiest”, but if you know to look out for them and think logically, you will be ok\\n\\n**Introduction to Cryptography – D334 (8 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed my first OA attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. Lots of memorization in this class. Just like all the other threads you will see about this course. Shawn’s Course Study Guide/Notes found in course chatter is all you need. The book is ok, but is pretty dry. Shawn did a very good job on his study guide. Its all you need! Get familiar with that and then do his practice exams for each chapter. You will pass. The PA and his practice exams were pretty close to the OA in terms of difficulty and style of question. Lots of memorization. I’m probably in the minority here, but I thought the subject matter was very interesting. I think about this stuff when I download programs and visit websites and stuff. It only took me about a week to finish this class, but I got pretty immersed in it. The concept of cryptography is pretty much engrained in me. Regarding the exam, questions seemed to be more skewed towards PKI, Wireless Encryption Protocols and Tunneling. These seem to show up the most on my exam and there were very few questions on blockchain/crypto currency and lightweight cryptography. The rest of the topics were pretty evenly distributed. It was a good introductory course in my opinion.\\n\\n**Managing Information Security – C843 (4 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Didn’t read any course material. Just read and did the assignment. You will need to do an incident analysis and response as well as a risk assessment. There is a lot of crap you are going to have to discuss and write about, such as legal acts, tools, techniques for gathering and analyzing, examination process etc…. It’s a very annoying assignment. I did not care for it in the slightest.\\n\\n**Cyber Defense and Countermeasures – D340 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- The CYSA+ is required for this class. WGU is enforcing a policy where accelerators can only have one class approved at a time and the program must be taken in a specific order….atleast that is what my mentor told me and won’t budge on it. The reason I’m mentioning this is because the order in which they have you do classes makes sense and does a good job preparing you systematically in my opinion. Every class builds on each other and the time you are required to take the CYSA+ is the right time. That being said, I felt the CYSA+ is a much harder version of the Security+. It went much deeper in security concepts compared to the Sec+ and I found some aspects of it to be rather difficult. However, all the Comptia exams you have taken so far preps you for the CYSA+. The cryptography class taken before this class, covers most of the cryptography questions on this exam. The digital forensics course that we have to take before this was sufficient enough to not have to do in depth studying for this exam. For studying, I just blew through the Total Seminar CYSA+ Series on Udemy and did a quick run through with things I was not familiar with the CYSA+ Certification Passport Book by Bobby Rogers. I did not do any practice exams. My lack of study was due to me being over confident. The PBQs were fun though. From what I remember, they all had to do with using nmap to determine what specific servers did and log trouble shooting. That was pretty much the gist of all the PBQs. They were pretty straight forward. <750 is considered a fail…I passed with a 751 on the first attempt. Probably should have done some practice exams to get that score up a little. Pass is a pass!\\n\\n**Managing Cloud Security – D320 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed this OA by a slim margin the first attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. The instructor for this course was a relief because he just let me do it after I told him I reviewed the book the previous day. Normally they make you do a bulls\\\\\\*\\\\\\*t generic study plan and make you jump through a bunch hoops. Apparently the course was redone and a new exam had been made following the CCSP text book. This test was a doozy as there are 125 questions. However, just going over the book is sufficient. It was for me anyways. A lot of it will be a review which makes studying quite quick. It followed the book quite nicely. There were no curve balls and the questions were pretty straight forward. I’d probably say that the most sh\\\\\\*tty thing was having to memorize the various laws and frameworks. This is a must! You also need to make sure you are familiar with all the different frameworks and standards, quantitative risk assessment, uptime institute, data lifecycle, SOC report types, Software Development Lifecycle and Stride Threat Model.\\n\\n**Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis – D332 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\* This is taken from a previous post I made after I finished this class. Im reposting it here so you don’t have to search for it.\\*\\n\\n\\- By far the most difficult exam in my opinion. This was the only Comptia test that I failed the first time. All the Comptia exams kind of built off the previous and you could make your way around the exams without feeling completely lost. Pentest+ was different, the previous exams will help you very little. The things you really have to know are the commonly used tools and what they do. There is a lot of them and there are bunch of questions like “which tool would use for this?”. NMAP commands and syntax (very heavy in this), SQL Injection/XSS types and deciphering vulnerability logs. Make sure you have a semi decent grasp on SQL in general. ALL the different types of attacks that are commonly used. There are some that came up that I did not come across in the book. If you know the main/commonly used ones, you should be ok for the most part. Learn scripting! You will not need to write any per se, but you might as well learn because there are questions where you need to decipher/interpret various scripts and therefore need to know how to write them. Make sure you know the different syntax. For example, know how an array is written in PowerShell (there is a question in the exam where you will need to figure this out). Learn the common commands for PS, Bash and Linux. There was a couple questions having to do with common HTTP methods. There were not really any questions regarding the different laws. Definitely do not need to focus on that. You should know them anyways if you had just done the Managing Cloud class. The PBQs were medium difficulty. From what I remember, they were as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n1. Mix and match: You will get like a single line of script (or payloads rather) and you have to pick what kind of vulnerability it is and then you need to pick a method of remediation. Need to know your scripting and various types of SQL injection. This is critical. There will be like (10) of these you have to do.\\n\\n2. Scripting: On the right, there will be a block of incomplete scripting. On the left, you will have multiple options of code snippets that you will need to use to plug into the incomplete areas of the code. The code is prewritten for you. You just need to place the right snippet in the correct blank spot where the code is incomplete. There are twice as many code snippets then there are blank spots so you can’t just use the process of elimination. You kind of have to have some sort of clue. Also, the code might be in Bash, Python or Ruby. You have to be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n3. NMAP Interpretation: You will get a block of an NMAP scan result. Like above, you will have a bunch of options on the right hand side. You will be asked to put together the correct NMAP command to get the results shown in the scan output. Part 2 is that you will need to also pick the trouble areas (attack vectors) based on what the scan shows. There will be a list of options for you to choose from.\\n\\n4. Investigate Login Page: You will be given a login page of which you can view the certificate, source code and cookies. You will need to determine if any of those 3 things have issues. If they do, you will need to specify and provide a solution.\\n\\nThe Sybex book is by far the best book for this course. I did not care for the Sybex books in the other courses. Finding a good video series was difficult. I’m a total seminars fan, but this one did not do it for me. I hate the Dion materials in general and I’ve tried others on Udemy and Youtube and none of them were doing it for me. Another great book is Pentest+ for dummies. Very engaging. Lastly, you must spend time and do labs to understand the concepts. You’re really shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t. Look into tryhackmeDOTcom as well. I took the exam 3 days after registering for the class after a quick review. I thought I would be ok and I wanted to quickly get it over with. I found out in the first 10 questions and the PBQs that I was very underprepared. I took the test again a week later after intense studying and passed.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project – C769 (9 Days)**\\n\\nEh, it is what it is. A bunch of busy work. No need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look in WGUs database that has\\n\\nall the previous capstones that were rewarded for “excellence” and look at them for inspiration, ideas and see how they put theirs together. There is also a dedicated capstone page that will provide templates and samples for you so you will not be totally lost. I chose to propose implementing an “Insider Threat Management System” for a pharmaceutical company based on a scenario that I made up. There are 3 parts to the capstone: submitting what you will propose, writing the actual proposal and writing a post implementation report/reflection. None of it is difficult, it is just time consuming as they are asking for you to include a lot of stuff. 70% of part 3 is going to ask you for the same thing in part 2. I literally just cut and pasted the applicable sections from part 2 and changed the wording to past tense as part 3 is supposed to occur after you implemented your system. There will be a portion where you have to use outside references and cite books or whatever…just goto researchgateDOTcom query whatever subject you’re doing, pick however many you need from the search results that pertain and just read the abstracts and tie them into your proposal and cite them (already provided when you select a paper to view). This should save you some time. You are also going to need to turn in some sort of “deliverable” whether it be code sample, UML diagrams, operations manual, etc… I would suggest just doing a simple process diagram and explain each process. Its quick and easy and satisfies that requirement. If you goto apps dot diagrams dot net, you can build a nice one for free. If you want to be ultra creative and spend all your time doing the capstone on some crazy and innovative idea, all good. However, I would suggest you put in the bare minimum effort and move on, finish this program and get started on your new career asap. I WOULD NOT put any effort into this capstone! WGU doesn’t require it (they are just looking that you have all the things in their rubric). This project is not beneficial in any way and its not like you would be using it for a portfolio or anything. Do not waste your time on it. Read the requirements make sure you include those requirements and go.\\n\\n**List of exams from least difficult to most difficult:**\\n\\n1. A+ part 2\\n\\n2. A+ part 1\\n\\n3. SSCP\\n\\n4.

I do not know how difficult it will be. Can’t be that hard. I’ll provide a writeup when I do take it\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2 things that may or may not help you…**\\n\\n1. There is a lot of information on the internet about how to study. Reading the text book through and through and taking notes is not efficient nor is it the best way and it is what is called “passive learning”. It is more efficient to do active learning. Which means…well…do active things when you’re learning…flash cards, practice exams, simulate teaching the material, physical home lab, etc…\\n\\nWhen it comes to studying especially for exams, my normal study habit is to watch a video series on 2x the speed or the fastest it can be where I can clearly understand it. You are trying to get an overview and have familiarity with everything. The video is visual and helps things stick. You’ll be surprised how much you can pick up. I will not take notes, just jot down questions of things I need to go over as they come up while I am watching. When Im done with the series, I will then look those question topics up and determine the what, why, and how of it to understand that particular topic/concept. Then I will generally do a practice exam, note question topics that I am not familiar with to look up when done. I will also go over the questions missed and then repeat then go over the same or another practice exam. It doesn’t matter if the test is not that similar in style/difficulty to what you are taking if you take the time to understand the concept. Comprehensive practice exams is my preference but anything that is “active” is good. You will figure out what works best for you. Just don’t read a book front to back, take notes in between and try to memorize it unless you like being inefficient and wasting your time…unless that is what is best for you. Lol\\n\\n2. Most of you already know this, but ChatGPT is your friend! By far the most valuable tool for me. It can be abused or it can be used as an extremely well-functioning learning tool. You are only hurting yourself if you want to try and use it for other purposes. When I would study my material and need to understand a topic like OSI models for example, I would write something like “Explain to me like a child what the OSI layers are and what they do. Also provide me an analogy.”. I cannot tell you how easy it was for me to pick things up when Chatgpt was able to explain things to me like im a 5 year old and provide me an easy to understand analogy. Analogies was a game changer for me. If you still don’t understand, you can have full conversations with it and ask it questions until you do understand it. Something like “I don’t understand, why would it do \\\\\\*this when it seems to do \\*that? You said \\*this. What is difference between \\*this and \\*that?”! Like full on conversations. Try it right now and see what I’m talking about! Use it to your advantage for learning. It is an amazing resource! Word of caution though, it is not always right depending on what you are asking or telling it what to do so when in doubt verify it.\\n\\n**My thoughts overall:**\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking: “ MmMMMmGoOoOo! BuT, bUt, BuT, YoU JuSt RuShEd ThRoUgH iT aNd DiD NoT LeArN AnyThInG! mMmGoOoOoOo!”. I learned the amount of material I needed to learn to get through the entire program and have probably come out with just as much as everyone else who graduated regardless of time spent. More than others in some cases. I also feel like I have a gotten a very solid foundation out of it, which was my expectation. \\n\\nHere is the thing, I would rather blow through the program and pay minimum tuition of $4k (plus get all my bonus certs!), continue learning and fill in gaps after completion at my leisure vs taking my sweet time and pump out the program in 3-4 terms and pay $12k-$16k. I guarantee I will have far surpassed that person’s knowledge on an intellectual and practical level by the time he/she is done. My learning will never stop, but my tuition will as soon as I can make it stop! Time is money. Massive acceleration is the way to go if it can be done…in my opinion. That is the beauty of WGU.\\n\\nThat being said, I feel like I’m just beginning, in that I’ve only dipped my toe and now the real learning begins. Now that I have the time and am not at the mercy of my term date lest I pay another 4k, I will go back and fill in my gaps and really start doing real world practical stuff and labs that I did not do. I did build a pretty intricate homelab that I will be using heavily. Anyways, I feel like this program did an excellent job in providing a solid foundation and I do mean excellent. I do not regret it in any way and I am in many ways more excited about this then I was with the Computer Science degree. That’s all I got. Good luck to you all!

Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My Fun 41-Day MBA Journey - SO WORTH IT!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\*This is about my MBA journey, I hope to inspire, but don't be hard on yourself if your accelerated path is different\\*\\n\\nI was highly motivated and inspired by the post I read in this Reddit group from Sleyk2010, along with many other accelerators in this group and a few FB groups. Before I chose WGU for my MBA, I had my share of skepticism. I looked at numerous online and Brick and Mortar schools (I received my Bachelor’s from a traditional B&M University). I completed my BSBM in a little over two years for a 5-year program (about 18 months ago), so I was already used to acceleration. I could have accelerated my Bachelor’s degree even more, but of course, I could only go as fast as the university allowed. I had to go the full 6 or 8 weeks for a course, even if I completed all of my exams, papers, and reading ahead of time. This led to me doubling and tripling my course load each semester. What drew me to WGU was that I CAN DICTATE MY PATH. I knew that I had a hunger for reading books, writing papers, and retaining the coursework. I am just maniacal like that, so I don’t expect everybody to feel the way I do about school. I knew I could crush my goals through acceleration because I know myself well enough and have been able to do it in the past. School is actually fun for me and if that makes me weird or crazy, I will proudly own that, lol.\\n\\nAll of this being said, everyone approaches school at their own individual pace and I am not writing this to declare that everybody will complete their Master’s degree in a matter of weeks or a few months. Everyone’s motivation is also not the same and how a person approaches school impacts how they set their pace. There is no way to “cheat” a degree. Everyone gets the SAME courses and the same coursework. Less than 10% of students accelerate at a pace where they can achieve their degree in well under one term/semester. The norm is that students will take two terms or more. Be clear that it IS TOTALLY OKAY. There is no “correct amount of time” to finish a degree. It is totally up to you based on your motivation, the time you dedicate to it, and your ability to absorb the coursework.  No matter how quickly you finish, be proud that you finished and that it took some hard work to get there.\\n\\nSo, let me get to the fun part. The Reddit and Facebook groups are helpful and great motivators for those who decide to come to WGU. It is a great school, properly accredited, and VERY reputable. WGU is also very relevant for the working adult and career-minded individuals who want to advance their careers. I am laying out a full course-by-course write-up of how I approached each course and how I successfully passed it. Let me be clear, this is how I did it and what worked for me, so by no means will this be a blanket approach that works for everyone. It is a lot of hard work and some frustrating days will be ahead, but trust me, obtaining your MBA is doable if you stay focused and put in the work. I don’t have any “tricks,” no rubrics, no papers to use for sampling, and no study guides to pass along. For the sake of academic integrity, I won’t risk myself or anyone putting a stain on the school or me for giving people the easy way out. If I had to do the work, so do you. I am offering some guidance and motivation for students in the program. Hopefully, acceleration will work well for you all too!!!!\\n\\nAgain, I don’t have any work to pass along, so please don’t inquire. If anyone feels the need to minimize and discredit accelerators, keep that negative energy somewhere because accelerators are the exception, not the norm, so this is NOT easy. As you will see many accelerators say, they will not apologize for busting their ass to obtain their degree faster than others. Some people are brainiacs, some are overachievers, and some are both. That is not a bad thing. Also, some Program Mentors are better than others and will be supportive of your path. My mentor was AWESOME and I came in with a game plan and strategy that she backed me up on. I made it clear that I was accelerating and would NOT be in the program longer than 45 days because I am on a mission. I am maniacal in my approach and putting in 40 hours or more a week outside of work to do schoolwork is not a problem for me. I can rest when I finish my degree. I do not suggest this for everyone. Plus, I have an empty nest with all my adult children out on their own. I had some downtime at work and figured no time was better than the present to get my MBA and advance my career. I will start with the Three Commandments of WGU, which I will cite as a source courtesy of SLEYK2010 himself (which are great by the way!!)\\n\\n*“The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.”*\\n\\n***To add as an addendum to the commandments, use Grammarly or some type of paper editing application for your papers. They will eliminate grammar and spelling errors on all of your papers. It is your best friend. Also, use Quizlet, they have very useful study guides to use for the courses.***\\n\\n**\\*Disclaimer\\* This is not the order I TOOK the courses in, they are in numerical order. My game plan was to do all of the PA (writing courses) first and switch my brain over to the analytical courses next (ones with OAs). I did C213 and C214 Back-toBack because there was a lot of cross-over between the two courses. I  saved C215 and C207 for last because of the cross-over and because I wanted to close out with the OA and PA course (C207).**\\n\\n**On to the courses!!!**\\n\\n**ORA1** – **Orientation** – One PA\\n\\nDo what you feel is best for the orientation. If you have done a lot of research on the academic program before orientation opens up, this “course” won’t be tedious. Follow the rubric, keep it simple, and peruse the “coursework.” It simply gives an overview of what to expect as a student and ensures that you are prepared to start your program. Be as realistic as you can be when asked about how much of a time commitment you can truly make each week to your schoolwork.\\n\\n**C200** – **Managing Organizations and Leading People** \\- Two OAs (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nYou will start with what is called the “Signature Themes Assessment.” It does not take hella long to do and when you complete it, save the PDF. Task #1 is a paper centered around the assessment that you took. PLEASE FOLLOW THE RUBRIC when you write the paper. Task #2 focuses on leadership that you experienced in your career. It can be a past or present company. You won’t be able to use actual names for the company or the person (or people) that you write about. Have fun with it, the assignment will be about your life experiences, so it will be easy to speak to either way. I finished both papers in one day, I just got diarrhea of the brain and my hands did the rest. This is one course where I will say that even though there is some reading that is available, it won’t be of much use. The readings are pretty much common sense type of stuff and won’t make much of an impact on the papers that you have to write in this course. Just get straight to writing and have fun with it.\\n\\n**C202** – **Managing Human Capital** – One OA (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nThis class was pretty straightforward in my eyes. I assume we are all adults here and have been a part of a workplace environment that involved employee interaction. A lot of common sense and work experience type of content is in this course. The technical aspects of this course (terminology and concepts) are in the reading materials and there is a Quizlet (get acquainted with this site, it is VERY helpful) that is very helpful for the course. I did some of the reading, but a lot of it was stuff I covered extensively in undergrad, so I didn’t have to deep dive into the reading materials. This is the Human Resources course of the MBA program. I took the pre-assessment and reviewed my weak areas. I skimmed the readings and reviewed a few Quizlets to help me prepare for the OA. It took me about two days total to do the reading, study, and pass the OA. Again, the course is not a beast, you will know more about the course than you will think. Some people may take longer to get through the course and trust me, THAT IS OKAY.\\n\\n**C204** – **Management Communication** – Three PAs -Two Papers and One PPT&Video (Another Straightforward and Easy Course) \\n\\nThis course was actually a lot of fun. Tedious, but easy enough. There are some reading materials for this course, but honestly, they don’t provide much help for the actual tasks. I skimmed the materials to see what use I could make of them, but I was able to dive right into the tasks. Task #1 is a paper, but it will be constructed in a weird manner. The course is about professional communication in the workplace. You will be writing emails from the perspective of being a business owner or a supervisor. You will be writing emails to your staff, a business partner, and the stakeholders. The three emails will be fun to make, so don’t overthink the assignment.  Task #2 is a Powerpoint and Video. WGU uses Panopto for video creation. If you have never used it before (most of us probably have not), they provide instructional videos on how to use it. You should have access to Panopto as a student, but if you don’t, reach out to the IT department, and they will rectify that for you pretty quickly, usually within 24 hours. The video only needs to cover the points in the rubric and your PPT should be an outline of the presentation. Mine took over 15 minutes, but I am a classroom trainer by trade, so it was in my wheelhouse. Most people can truly do their presentation in less than 10 minutes. Follow the rubric to ensure you cover all the points they want you to cover and you will be fine. Task 3 is an executive summary. A one-page paper and you are good to go. All three tasks can be done by jumping in head first while the reading materials provide just a little help for the papers. I was able to complete all three tasks over two days.\\n\\n**C206** – **Ethical Leadership** – Three PAs (Straightforward but VERY tedious course)\\n\\nI did not personally find this class to be “hard,” but it is very labor-intensive. This course is similar to C200 in that you will be using another assessment called the “Ethical Lens Inventory” to start you off before your first task. There are 3 PAs and they are a doozy, lol. I honestly had fun with this class because I had a few ethics courses in undergrad and had to apply them in real life at work. The reading materials are enlightening and helpful but don’t be intimidated by any of the reading. A lot of the reading is stuff you have previously or currently face in your workplace and your life. I had a LOT of ammo to use for these papers, so the writing was pretty easy for me. Task #1 is to write about a leader you admire, a leader you know, or a famous leader. It does not matter; just make sure you cite any sources if you use someone you don’t know personally. Task #2 is focused on social responsibility, ethics in the workplace, and ethical leaders. You may find that your work experiences will be very useful for this paper. Life experiences can be the best teacher. Task 3 is a paper about leadership and the code of ethics. All three tasks will include life experiences and ethics concepts, so the reading materials are helpful. PLEASE make sure you follow the rubric to the letter for each task because it can be easy to miss a section and have your paper sent back for revision. I spent one day reading the materials a bit and two days doing the papers. Three days total. I wrote over 15 pages for each task, but trust me, many of you can do them in 10 pages, give or take a page. I do like to write, so I tend to write with extensive details, but if you like to keep things simple and just answer each section in a rubric, DO THAT. Writing a novel is not necessary, lol. I did get two excellence awards for 2 of the tasks I wrote for this course, so the long ass days of writing were worth it for me.   \\n\\n**C207** – **Data-Driven Decision Making** \\- Two PAs and One OA (Hard course for most, not very straightforward)\\n\\nIf any of you have read up on this class on Reddit or Facebook, you will see that this class beats people up. I can understand why it does. This is the Statistics class of the program. No real reading materials are provided for this course, which is why I say it is not so straightforward. There are TONS of PPTs and videos from the course instructors for this course. USE THEM. I personally love statistics and data, so I didn’t feel intimidated by the class. There is not a lot of math used in this course, it is heavy on concepts and statistical methods. Again, there are tons of resources in the course from the CIs, such as videos, study guides, and PPTs. Review them multiple times if you have to until you start to comprehend the material. Reach out to a CI if you need assistance, they are there to help. Quizlet is also helpful for the OA in this course because you will be using a lot of terminology. For task #1, you are forming a hypothesis that you will have to analyze for task #2. Once the evaluators approve task #1, you can move to task #2. The course will provide the framework for all the statistical methods you can use for your hypothesis. Most people chose a T-Test or ANOVA. I chose linear regression. I only chose it because it made more sense for my hypothesis. Use a topic you are familiar with for your hypothesis, it will make the task less painful. I used home values and mortgage rates because I work in the financial world, but I easily could have used sports for a topic too. For task #2, they provide videos and PPTs for each test that you perform and will show you how to input them in Excel. You will need at least 30 data points to use for the assignment but trust me, once you gather the info, it gets easier from there. Once you run the analysis in Excel, you will be writing a short paper (probably no more than 5 or 6 pages) that covers about 6 or 7 bullet points. As always, follow the rubric and keep it simple. For the OA, they provide a pretty good study guide and flashcards for the terminology, but Quizlet is an excellent supplement for this as well. The pre-assessment does not align heavily with the OA, but use it as a starting point for the areas that you do need to cover for the OA. My Program Mentor let me push this class to the end before the Capstone because I wanted to follow the Operations Management course (there is a lot of crossover between the courses). I honestly had fun with this class because I love Stats and Math (I am a math tutor on the side), so I didn’t lose my mind in the course. It took me about five days to read and watch the course materials, do the tasks, study, and pass the OA. Realistically, this course can easily take many weeks for people to complete and that is okay. It is not easy for most and you truly want to comprehend and retain what you learn in the course. \\n\\n**C211** – **Global Economics for Managers** – One PA (Somewhat hard course for most)\\n\\nMany people have stated this course kicked their butt and I can see why. There is a lot of technical stuff to cover in this course and if you are not a fan of economics or did not cover it much in undergrad, this class will be brutal. For me, I like this type of stuff and still use a lot of the micro and macro Econ knowledge I learned in undergrad, especially being in the financial industry. There are reading materials, study guides, videos, and PPTs available for this course and they are very helpful materials to use. Focus on the areas where you are the weakest because you don’t want to be in the dark in important areas that you don’t know. There are a lot of terms and concepts that you need to know and the study guides are very helpful in covering what you need to know. Use Quizlet too, it supplements the course material tremendously. There are helpful YouTube videos for Econ as well, so just know that there are many ways to skin a cat here to find helpful information. The pre-assessment somewhat aligns with the OA, so spot your weak areas and drill those down before the OA. I felt the class was not hard for me because of what I came into the class with, but I know that this class can be a lot of work for many. It is not a race; take as much time as you need to understand the course. It took me about three days to complete the course, but just try to get as much as you can out of the course and do it at your pace.   \\n\\n**C212** – **Marketing** – One HUGE PA (Straightforward and somewhat easy course)\\n\\nThis course was easy in terms of understanding the materials but the final paper is long as hell. You really have to APPLY what you learn in the course. I still remembered many marketing concepts from my Bachelor’s program, so I didn’t have to spend far too much time in the book. The concepts are easy to understand and there is no test, so just dig around a little bit in the reading materials for information that you need. There is no way to sugarcoat this, the paper is very long. It will likely be the longest individual paper you write in the program. With that being said, try to have fun with the paper. Many of the areas you have to cover on the rubric are based on your opinion of what you would do if you made marketing decisions for a business. Some of the technical stuff is in the readings, but a good portion of the paper is based on what you would do to market a business. My paper was about 20 pages, but I didn’t feel it was brutal. All in, I completed the course in 2 days. The writing was a lot, but not painful. \\n\\n**C213** \\- **Accounting for Decision Makers** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most, but reasonable)\\n\\nThis course is very technical and if you aren’t familiar with accounting, it may beat you up a little bit. However, if you have any accounting knowledge from your bachelor’s programs, this course will not feel so brutal. Being the nerdy dork that I am, I think accounting is fun. I still retained a lot of what I learned from undergrad and apply it in real life because I do my own accounting for my side business. I still got a lot out of the class and brushed up on concepts that I had learned before, so the class was not hard for me. With all of this being said, there are reading materials (especially the Hawaiian shirt guy who had a video at the end of each chapter) and a few other videos and study guides in the course. The materials are very helpful, trust me. YouTube even has a few basic accounting videos (just like YouTube has for Economics) that are useful. Whatever you do, just make sure you find materials that help you understand accounting concepts effectively. There is a lot of technical work to nail down for the OA and you will want to know and understand basic accounting concepts. There is hardly any math on the OA, and the minimal math used is not hard. Know your debits and credits, the accounting formula, and understand accrual accounting. Quizlet is also a useful tool to supplement the course materials. The course only took me two days to complete and pass the OA, but that is because I already knew the material and could grasp the new stuff. This is a course you may find will be useful in the future, so try to get something out of the class, no matter if it takes you weeks to get through it. Use the CIs if you are struggling because some of the concepts may initially feel foreign.\\n\\n**C214** – **Financial Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most)\\n\\nI won’t sugar coat it, this course is not as fun for me as the rest, lol. I don’t mind finance as a whole, it is just sooooo tedious. If you don’t have a finance calculator (I have had one for many years), make sure you get one. The preferable calculator to use is the TI-30 BAII. If you use any other kind of calculator, you are asking for your life to be filled with agony. Learn the basic functions of the calculator. The course provides a good video on how to use it as well as YouTube. However you do it, just make sure you know how to use the bloody thing. The great thing about this course is that the pre-assessment and the OA will provide all of the formulas that you need to use. You don’t have to remember the formulas, but you do need to know how to apply them and plug them into the calculator. This PA has much more math than the OA, so you will want to focus more on the concepts of Finance and how they apply to the real world. This course has some VERY helpful study guides, PPTs, and videos from the CIs. Quizlets are also very useful. Watch those darn videos 100 times if you have to until it sticks. You will not want to skate through this course, many people fail the OA, and many fail more than once. You can’t BS through this course, you will need to use the materials to grasp the concepts and enlist the help of a CI if you truly get stuck. The math part of the class was the easy part for me, I spent more time focusing on the application of finance principles and that was very fulfilling. I was able to learn things that I did not cover in my finance course in undergrad. I completed the course and passed the OA in a total of 4 days, but I came in with a pretty good foundation that really helped me retain the stuff I learned in the course. Remember, GO AT YOUR PACE. Once you feel confident about the materials, take that OA and put it behind you. \\n\\n**C215** – **Operations Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard Course)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I like this course the least, lol. The main reason is that I was not as passionate about the material. With that being said, I got the most out of this course. I learned a hell of a lot. There is quite a bit of cross-over with C207 because the manufacturing industry utilizes a lot of statistical methods (like Six Sigma, Lean, etc.).  I studied my ass off in this class and completing it was the most fulfilling. The reading materials are helpful, but they are dense and probably more dry than most of the reading. The study guides in the course from the CIs, Quizlet, and some of the reading from the book got me through the class. It is honestly that simple. The materials are there, they are straightforward, they apply to the OA, and they are tools to help you succeed in the course. It took about five days to learn the materials, study, and pass the OA. This course tends to stop people in their tracks and they drag through this class for over a month or more. Don’t be scared of the course. Dive in, learn the material, and don’t stop and start the course to drag it out. That is how you lose your momentum and the course ends up feeling sluggish. Operations Management will be very good material to retain and for people in factories or other manufacturing fields, you will be very comfortable with the coursework. I will also add that this course is one of the most important courses to use as a foundation for the Capstone.\\n\\n**C216** – **MBA Capstone** – Three PAs - PPT & Video, One Huge Paper, and 3-part final task (Very Tedious Course but soooooo much fun)\\n\\nWoohoo!!!!! You made it to the end!!!! You will now apply all the valuable teachings from your other courses and roll them all into the Capstone. The Capstone is centered around a Marketplace Business Simulation. You will be the owner and decision-maker of a business and have six total quarters to make sound business decisions and get a simulation score of at least 0.001 or higher. If you fail, you have the take the simulation all over again. Trust me, you do not want to be set back because of that. Before you do the simulation, it wouldn’t hurt to read the Conscious Capitalism articles they provide. There is no book for the course, just the articles. The CIs provide videos on how to do each task and they may be helpful for each of you to use when figuring out how to structure your presentation and paper. Now, on to the Simulation. You are going to do the simulation for three quarters and pause. You will assess your business and review your decisions so far (you cannot go back and change them once you submit the quarter). Do all of Quarter 4, but do NOT submit it (or else you will make your life hell and screw up the simulation for yourself). Once you complete (but not submit) Quarter 4, it is time to do the PPT and video presentation for task #1. You are a business owner and should act as such, so wear some business casual clothes for your Panopto presentation. You are giving an update of the business through Q4 and telling stakeholders your business plan while asking for more money to invest for the next few quarters. Don’t stress over the PPT, the course provides a template for the presentation PPT and you just have to fill in the relevant information from your business. Most people can do their presentation in 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes. Mine was 40 minutes, but that is because I live for classroom teaching and presentations. It is fun and I definitely overdid it. Once you complete Task #1 and submit it, NOW you can go in and submit Quarter 4. You have to submit task #1 before you do that so the evaluators can go in and open the final two quarters. Now you will work on completing Quarters 5 and 6. My best advice is to be a conscious business. Your decisions should be centered around that because that is what this is all about, right? You can get a jump on task #3 while you wait for task #1 to be reviewed. Task #3 is a reflection paper on what you have learned in the MBA program, make a S.M.A.R.T. goal, how it will be used for your future career path, and include “career and education artifacts.” You will also submit your LinkedIn profile. The rubric will break it all down for you. You can easily complete task #3 in a few hours with the paper and the gathering of your artifacts. Beware though, you CAN NOT submit task #3 until you have completed AND submitted task #2. Just keep it on ice until you submit task #2 and submit task #3 a minute later.  Once you complete all six quarters, you will review your business results in Quarter 7. From this point, you will gather everything you need for the final paper in task #2. Task #2 will be long (mine was 20 pages), but there will be screenshots of graphs and other charts included, so it will not be 100% written words, lol. Follow the trusty rubric and just rock out that last huge paper. You ran the business and made all the decisions, so you will have all of the intimate details of the simulation and will be the best person to speak on it, so own it and tell your story! Whew! Submit task #2, then submit task #3 and wait for the last evaluations of the MBA program.   The Capstone took me about nine days.\\n\\nThe MBA program took me 41 days, but I feel if I didn’t have to go out of town a few times, give myself a couple of days of rest, and not lose a day to revise a task (Task #3 of the Capstone, my silly self did not upload one of my artifacts), I would have completed it in less than 30. I will still take it though and I am very proud that I still crushed my goal.\\n\\nOnce everything is graded and you get confirmation that your final task passed, you can now scream to the world….. YOU ARE AN MBA GRAD!!!!!! \\n\\nSoak in the moment, celebrate your achievement, thank your mentor(who will submit you for graduation), thank your family and friends who have been in your corner, and pat yourself on the back for what you accomplished. Then, wait about 7-10 days for the WGU Owl and Confetti to appear on your WGU profile page, which will officially confirm you are a grad and can no longer access your courses. The road is not easy and some may take longer to get to the finish line than others, but once you finish, you are a winner. No one will be able to take it away from you!!!\\n\\nGO OWLS!!! Remember, you can do it with effort and motivation too :-)\\n\\nON TO THE MSML WHEN MY NEXT TERM BEGINS!!!!!!!  \n",

Full accelerated-BSIT Write Up\\n**Intro**  \\nHi Night Owls! I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and I've been here since the summer of 2023. I'm a 22y/o based out of the east coast (US). WGU changed my life. In this post I'm going to share my story and the result of 18 months of hard work! I'm also going to provide you guys with the best tips and pieces of information I've gathered from countless hours of researching the job market, reading r/resumes and other related subreddits, news articles, interviews, etc. I'm making this post as a way of reflecting on the past 2 years of my life and to give back to the community by sharing information & my story. My DMs are open for anybody who has questions or would just like to chat!\\n\\n**Background**  \\nI was working as a security guard before WGU and I had a lot of free-time at work to spend on my laptop. I knew I wanted a degree but couldn't afford the tuition and didn't like the idea of graduating much later than my friends I went to HS with. WGU offered me a solution to both of these problems, and I was able to complete a LOT of school work during work hours (I had explicit permission from my manager). This was an amazing opportunity for me because I still lived at home with my parents and was being paid between $17-20/hr to complete school work. If this sounds like something that interests you, I encourage you to apply to Securitas, Allied Universal, GardaWorld, or Prosegur. Look for \"warm body\" sites- locations where you're paid to just sit at a desk in an empty building. Overnight and weekend jobs are great for this sort of thing as well. A good resource for getting into the security industry is r/securityguards. You won't need to carry a firearm if that's a concern of yours. Also, be advised, some states require you to have a security guard license. Personally I didn't have to.\\n\\nI knew I wanted to study IT so choosing which degree program to enroll in wasn't difficult for me. I chose to do the accelerated BSIT->MSITM program and had a clear idea in mind of the career path I wanted to take. I cannot overstate the importance of doing research on career trajectories from different degrees. The [WGU website](https://www.wgu.edu/) does a decent job of providing degree and career information from whichever degree you choose, but the WGU website alone is simply not enough. Interview/talk with people in the field you're interested in, possibly shadow them, start projects of your own- it is entirely your responsibility to create a plan going into this. Changing your degree program later down the road is completely acceptable but do understand the consequences associated with that (time, money, etc). On a separate note, it's a good idea to organize your school materials and whatnot prior to starting. I created a free [Notion](http://www.notion.com) to keep track of my schedule, save informative Reddit posts and other course materials, track my progress, create reminders, store documents, etc. Another benefit of learning Notion and using it was that I was able to put this tool on my resume.\\n\\n**Pre-WGU**  \\nI took as many courses on [Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) that I possibly could, prior to officially enrolling. I'm not entirely sure if things are the same with Sophia nowadays but when I did it, all of the courses/tests were unproctored and open-book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you do Sophia courses. I didn't do [SDC](https://study.com/) and personally I don't recommend it because their courses can take a while. [This resource](https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines) outlines what you can transfer in, for each WGU degree. I also transferred in the CompTIA A+, N+, S+ (these three certifications together are commonly referred to as the trifecta), because I already had them. WGU will pay for attempts for certifications if they are *required* for your degree program. I used to have a good transfer guide saved but I'm not sure what happened to it; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1390mx6/bsit_im_still_waiting_on_my_transfer_eval_of_my/) might be a helpful resource as well. Also, before you officially enroll, make sure to buy a webcam for the OAs. I use the Webcam 1000 which is what WGU recommends. It plugs into my laptop and works great. I've heard of other people buying one that has a tripod, so do some research and get whichever is best for you. Despite the scary proctoring stories you might read on this subreddit, I've never had any bad experiences myself. YMMV\\n\\nYou get assigned a Program Mentor before your start date. Mine has been extremely helpful and respectful of my preferred communication style and needs. I have seen reddit posts where people complain about their mentors- them wanting to schedule too many meetings, not opening classes, etc. This might be a good [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/16ybsoq/can_i_request_to_change_my_mentor_what_is_your/).\\n\\n**WGU**  \\nMy start date was October 1, 2023. I was able to complete 13 courses in my first term (a term is a 6 month period). I definitely recommend looking up the course code in this subreddit (ex: C268) to find resources. Here is some helpful information about the courses that stand out to me:\\n\\nC268 - This was the 4th class I had, and the real first challenge for me. I think it's like a meme in the WGU-IT community that we've all used [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pf6syi/c268_spreadsheets_video/) to help us pass. <15hrs of studying.\\n\\nC962 - This class was the most amount of writing I've had to do in my undergrad. You'll enjoy this class if you like reading, researching, and finding a great quote to support your writing. I think I wrote my paper about AI or wearable technology or something. This class was <25 hrs of work.\\n\\nC773 - I enjoyed this class a lot. This is an [exceptional resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1f12w4e/summary_user_interface_design_c773_passed_in_6/)\\n\\nD333 - I passed this exemplary on my first attempt but a lot of people have trouble with this class. I think that most of the names of the laws you have to memorize are self-explanatory. [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1d2f20e/d333_finished_in_3_days_passed_first_try_heres_how/)reddit post helped me formulate a strategy for studying for the exam, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/zhy5l8/d333_ethics_in_technology_updated_class_version/) post provides a lot of good learning material.\\n\\nThe CompTIA trifecta can be studied through [free courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/tcqdwh/guys_please_remember_that_wgu_gives_you_a_lot_of/) through udemy (all WGU students get a free udemy account). FWIW, I quit my security guard job around this time because I was offered an unpaid internship at my friend's dad's company. I'll talk more about this later.\\n\\nMy second term was from April 1 - Sept 30, and I was able to complete 3 courses (10 CUs):\\n\\nC954 - I spent a week straight in the library studying for this. Imo, this class is on par with the CompTIA A+ in terms of just how much course material there is. [This](https://onlinedegreeblog.com/wgu-c954-information-technology-management/) is a FANTASTIC read for those interested. Personally I loved this class because I felt like it tied everything together and gave me PRACTICAL insight into how companies (and specifically their IT department) function. If you're interested in additional learning opportunities beyond WGU, definitely look into Hubspot. It's a very popular CRM (well, it's more than just a CRM) that a lot of employers care about.\\n\\nC783 - I actually have weird circumstances regarding this class. I *forgot* to submit my CAPM certification prior to my start date. I reached out to my mentor and Student Support Services for help. My Mentor was able to fill out a form or something... and well, WGU made an exception for me. WGU makes it clear that they don't accept transfer credit after matriculation but they did for me, just this once. As a result, my program changed a little bit. I believe the BSIT is normally 122 credits but mine was changed to 138. Because I had passed the CAPM, the additional credits came from other courses, outside of my BSIT program, that were marked as Passed simply because me having the CAPM qualified me as having passed those courses. I never took the WGU OA for this class.\\n\\nI definitely slowed down in my 2nd/3rd terms and honestly I slacked off a lot. I was able to pull myself together and finish despite a lack of motivation. My third term was scheduled to end on the end of March (this month).\\n\\nC769 - My capstone project took me 2 weeks. Mine was about improving the security posture of a fictitious company. I really enjoyed working on this. If you're reading this and are about to start/currently working on your capstone, congrats on making it this far! I had a fun time using resources from my previous classes to work on this. I took this class more seriously than some of the others because I wanted my work to be a reflection of everything I've learnt at WGU.\\n\\nC777 - The dreaded Web Dev Applications. I took the Sophia course that is supposed to provide a foundation for this course so I didn't start with much knowledge. I procrastinated for weeks lol. PLEASE read the Study Guide. [This](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI) is a link to the study guide but I'm not sure if that link works, so please also refer to the 21day challenge document, sent in an email by your course instructor. I also watched the TraversyMedia HTML+CSS video a couple times and followed along with him. He will have you download SublimeTxt which is good, but I chose to use Visual Studio Code. The C777 study guide is your best friend. You're ready for the OA if you can score 90%+ on the practice OA, and if you feel comfortable creating a website. Another thing: some people may disagree with this, but for the purpose of passing your OA, try to not teach yourself additional information that isn't covered in the class. It can be a lot of information, try not to overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nD247 - I hated this class. This was my absolute worst class, and I just hated every second of it. My course instructor was amazing and I absolutely recommend that you review the powerpoints they've created- it's what helped me pass! The powerpoints will most likely be emailed to you. If not, please ask for them. One small mistake will flag your entire answer wrong for OA questions where you have to write code.\\n\\n**Graduation and my Personal Success Story**  \\nI applied for graduation on March 3rd and officially graduated on the 11th. I was emailed a link to download my WGU transcripts the next day, and was emailed a digital copy of my Diploma today (the 18th). I'm still waiting for my physical diploma and [regalia](https://www.buildagrad.com/wgu) to arrive. I'll be attending the Vegas commencement in April, hope to see you all there!!!! Maybe we can get a big groupchat together for people going! :)\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, I was offered an internship at my friend's dad's IT company. It was very informal and honestly a little disappointing but I was grateful for the opportunity to observe their work and go with them to meet with clients. I stayed with them for about 3 months or so and then decided to take a break to focus on my last two classes. Part of me regretted leaving my security job but I also didn't want to continue working there either. In the end, it worked out for me because I was able to put that \"internship\" on my resume and I figured that it looks better than no internship.\\n\\nI started to apply for jobs the moment I submitted my graduation application, which is what I recommend to everyone (if not sooner). However, it wasn't until after I graduated when I found the job posting for the job I got an offer for. I graduated on 3/11- on 3/12 I applied to this IT support technician job. I reached out to the recruiter (guide on that below) and we instantly connected. She helped me secure a screener interview (through Zoom) with the company later that week. I passed the screener interview and we set up an in-person interview yesterday. Honestly, I bombed the technical questions. I got destroyed in front of the CEO. I think I got the position because I spoke confidently and was transparent about my knowledge gaps. I arrived in a freshly dry-cleaned suit with 3 copies of my resume, and I took notes during the interview on my black leather padfolio (please buy one of these!). Every time they asked me a technical question I didn't know the answer to, I wrote it down, and said I'd research the answer. Also- before my interview- I wrote down questions I had for them, in my padfolio.\\n\\nThe job I was offered is a hybrid position and I couldn't be happier!!!! In 1.5 years I went from a security guard making 17/hr to making TC\\~60k in an MCOL, and I still live w my parents so no rent. Never, absolutely *never* doubt yourself.\\n\\nBelow are some tips I have for Resumes, Cover Letters, Applying, and Interviews. :)\\n\\n**Resume and Cover Letter Tips**  \\nYou already know that your resume (and cover letter) is extremely important, so I'm going to talk about how you can improve. Resume formats and the amount of creativity you can have really depends on the industry, so please don't interpret this as an end-all-be-all guide. This is more so for tech. Bluntly, you should have a pretty straightforward and easy-to-read resume.\\n\\n* Your resume should be 1 page unless you have 10-15+ years of experience. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jeg5ks/4_yoe_unemployed_tech_field_united_states/) is similar to what I use for mine (Idk why it's so zoomed in). Also please don't use a two-column layout.\\n* Your resume should be in an ATS-readable font such as Arial or Times New Roman (I use TNR for mine) and size 11 or 12.\\n* I suggest that you keep your resume in black and white. Don't use icons, shapes, or emojis. Far too often I see resumes with a little phone icon or something next to their phone number. These icons/shapes/emojis can look nice but they can also mess with the ATS (applicant tracking system) scanners, and also take the readers attention away from important details as they can be very eye-catching.\\n* Aim to fill the entire page. If you don't have enough experience or whatever that's completely fine, but there are ways to mitigate that. For instance you should use 12px size font, maybe expand upon your PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY section, make the size of your headings a little bigger, etc. You could also put a Relevant Coursework section in your Resume and name your WGU classes (don't include the course code \"C268\", just the name). This is what I did. During an interview, the hiring manager asked me about one of my classes!\\n* Your name/contact info section should contain your Firstname Lastname, phone number (xxx) xxx-xxxx, email (make sure your email sounds professional. Your professional email shouldn't be \"[gamerboy1206@gmail.com](mailto:gamerboy1206@gmail.com)\", it should be your name), a link to your Linkedin profile, and then city, State. Never put your exact address on your resume. That's a security concern and they don't need your address anyways, or at least until you get a job offer.\\n* Please, Please trim your Linkedin handle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNDY2KnXBw) for a guide on how to do that. Ensure your trimmed Linkedin handle is then put at the top of your resume\\n* If you have experience that isn't relevant to what you're applying for, put it on your resume anyways! Especially if you were there for a long time or if you really gained skills/experience.\\n* The bullet points under your jobs should NOT be pure fluff words. Instead, write meaningful statistics and hard facts.\\n   * \"Increased operational efficiency\" means nothing. Instead, you can put \"Achieved X through Y which resulted in Z\"\\n   * One of the bullet points in my resume is \"Efficiently handled over 100+ monthly calls, including inquiries, service calls, incident reports, technical support, and emergency responses.\" This bullet point includes an actual statistic, \"100+\", in a timeframe \"monthly\", and I specified the different types of regular issues I dealt with. Truthfully, I could have been more specific on \"technical support\", but I got the message across that I handled a variety of different inquiries. My intention there was to showcase my diverse skillset- again, there is always room to improve!\\n* WGU actually offers classes on Resume building, and will review your resume for free. You can find information to that [here](https://careers.wgu.edu/channels/resumes/). I did this, and the results were amazing! The more people you can get to look over your resume, the better.\\n* !! This one is very important. The end result of your resume should be a PDF. I've always used Google Docs online to create my resume. It allows me to convert it into a PDF with two clicks of my mouse. When you download your PDF, PLEASE rename it to \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_Resume\", instead of just \"Resume\". This will make it 1000x easier for hiring managers to see your resume and know it's from you. A lot of people name their resume just \"Resume\"... you need to stand out, and that's how you do it!\\n\\nIn addition to a resume, you should also make a cover letter template. Meaning, for every new cover letter you create, you change the name of the job title and company (written in the CL) to match the job you're applying for.\\n\\n* If you choose to make two templates, here is what I recommend you do: the first template should be called \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_CoverLetter\\_CompanyName\" and also \"FirstName.Lastname.CoverLetter.CompanyName\". That way, there is a slight difference between the two (that only you know of) and it still looks professional. For instance, lets say you want to apply to Helpdesk roles and Project Coordinator roles. The Helpdesk cover letter template could be the one with the periods, whereas the Project Coordinator cover letter templates could be the one with the underscores. Again, this is a very subtle way for you to distinguish between the two, so you can have a more personalized cover letter for the jobs you're applying to. This is actually what I do personally.\\n   * For example, my Project Coordinator cover letter is more geared towards PM/Project coordinator positions. It mentions my CAPM cert\\n* Your Cover letter should contain the same name and contact info as your resume. Same email, phone number, city, etc.\\n* Your CL (ideally) should be the same font and font size as your resume. I don't think this is necessarily required but the attention-to-detail can go a long way. I like the uniformity of doing it this way.\\n* As a general rule of thumb: the first paragraph (3-4 sentences) should explain who you are, the body paragraph should talk about your experiences, qualifications, why you want the position, and why you're a good fit, and the closing paragraph (2-3 sentences) should reaffirm your interest, express gratitude, and indicate your eagerness to discuss this opportunity/interview.\\n\\n**My 'Guide-to-Apply'**  \\nIt's vey rare that I'll hear back from an application submitted thru Indeed. LinkedIn is my preferred way to apply. I have LinkedIn premium (I highly suggest you try the $0 down *free trial*). I swear, it's what helped me get this job. If you get contacted about scheduling an interview, your next steps should be to research the company ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is an amazingggg tool for this).\\n\\n* Look up for tech job openings near you. Most of IT (and some CS) start out in job titles such as Helpdesk, Support I, jr IT specialist, IT technician, stuff of that nature. That's what you should be looking for. Don't expect to go right into cybersecurity lol. The reality is that cybersecurity is mid-level and senior-level.\\n* Have realistic salary expectations. A huge factor is where you live (understand the terms LCOL, MCOL, HCOL). But I think that a very general rule of thumb is that out of college you can reasonably expect between 40-65k for an entry level IT job, with the national avg being about 51k ish.\\n* GET A PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT TAKEN FOR YOUR LINKEDIN. Have your hair nice, shave your face or freshen up your facial hair, wear a fresh outfit, have a SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND, and just be presentable. You should want to look your best. [This is interesting:](https://www.earth.com/news/attractive-people-have-more-career-opportunities-and-success/)\\n   * DON'T put your headshot (or any pictures) on your resume. This might be a norm in other cultures but definitely not for tech jobs in the US\\n* Go on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and get a nice background for your linkedin. Doesn't have to have any text, could even just be a solid color with a gentle gradiant. Anything is (usually) better than the default background. Mine is just a blue background with some lines on it, it looks like waves. It's just an artistic thing. But I made sure that the tie I'm wearing in my profile picture is the same shade of blue as my background. I think it ties it together nicely.\\n* Reach out to a recruiter. I wouldn't have gotten this job opportunity without my recruiter's help. In my opinion, a good recruiter might feel like a 'temporary career coach'. My recruiter gave me advice, gave me constant updates, insight, etc. She was amazing. This is the message I sent her to initiate our first conversation:\\n   * Hi,  I hope you're doing well! I came across the *JobName* position at *CompanyName* and am very interested. I’d love to learn more about the key qualities and skills you’re looking for in applicants. Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to send my resume if that would be helpful.  Looking forward to your reply!  Best, *FullName*\\n* Monitor your email regularly. People don't like to be kept waiting, especially when companies may be interviewing potentially hundreds of other applicants.\\n\\n**Interviews**  \\nOne of the best resources for interviews (and resumes too) I've ever come across is chief.analyst on tiktok.  Even though he's in an entirely different industry (finance), I love his advice and how articulate he is. Being able to speak confidently and clearly is a non-negotiable. Never underestimate the importance of good communication- it's what helped me get this job after not being able to answer a single technical question correctly despite being up against over 160 other applicants.\\n\\nIt's typical for you to go through a virtual interview before being invited to an in-person interview. This is called a screener and as the name suggests, it's for screening out candidates who don't meet the qualifications necessary or those who appear to be unenthusiastic. Showing enthusiasm and positive energy is incredibly important- you can show this by asking questions, smiling, and knowing what the company does.\\n\\n* I mentioned this earlier in my Graduation section but invest in a padfolio. I think I got mine for $12 from Target. It should carry 3 copies of your resume (anything more is excessive) business cards if you have them (I personally did not), a pen (ensure that it works and isn't out of ink!), and paper for notes. You don't need your padfolio for a virtual interview- instead, I'd recommend you have your full attention on the interviewer. It helps to look directly at the camera (instead of your screen) so it gives the illusion you're looking directly at the interviewer, from their end.\\n* In my padfolio, I also wrote down questions I wanted to ask the interviewers, the night prior to the interview. Having pre-written questions made me look more prepared and took the burden off of me of having to remember them.\\n* Push in your chair after getting up, like when leaving your interview. Similarly- if they offer you water at the start of your interview, make sure you throw out the cup in a trashcan and don't leave litter in their office.\\n* Maintain eye contact and speak slowly. For me, it helps when I use my hands when I talk.\\n* Look, dress, and smell nice. You don't have to be a model but definitely make yourself look the best you possibly can. Also, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.\\n* I like watching CareerVidz on Youtube because he comes across as a little silly and that may (hopefully) take some pressure off of you. It's okay to be nervous, but try not to make it apparent.\\n* Rehearse your [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54).\\n* Research the company you're applying for, before any interviews. You can show a genuine interest in the company by understanding what they do and who they are.\\n* References: If you don't have any professional references, you can definitely ask a course instructor or your Program Mentor! They are here to support you and they will absolutely vouch for you (speaking from experience).\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI think it's incredibly important to continuously grow and improve regardless of which stage you're at- whether you're considering enrolling, have already enrolled, are about to graduate, or even if you're looking for a job. I'm hopeful that my write-up is able to offer a fresh perspective on the challenges and possibilities you might encounter. Sorry for any typos/weirdly worded sentences lol.\\n\\nI'm now looking forward to starting my MSITM on April 1 and starting my new job. If you have any tips/advice for the MSITM program, I'd love to get some info\\n\\nHope to see y'all at the Vegas commencement ceremony!!\\n\\nEDITS: Expanded upon my internship, additional random bullet points all throughout  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       D288 - Back-End Programming 2024 Guide!\\nHello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click > new > Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n>Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: <version>3.3.6</version>\\nLombok: <version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\\n<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>\\n<version>3.3.6</version>\\n```\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>\\n<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>\\n<version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n>MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n>When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet<>();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below. Other Reddit users and I will try and get to them and answer them accordingly. If a significant update/revision should be made to the guide, please leave a comment suggesting a change. I'll try and keep this guide relevant for at least a little while, but with the new degree plan coming, it will inevitably become superannuated.  \\n\\nIf you followed this guide and passed, **CONGRATS!** This is probably the most technical project I've done so far in my degree, and I had a lot of fun with it. So, I hope this guide made the class enjoyable for you too! Wishing you well in your future studies! 📚🎉  \n",







                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                BSSWE Java Track Monster Guide and Review\\nI finally graduated! After 3 terms, working full time at my job and as a father. I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database & SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching & promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope & out-of-scope), requirements (functional & non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development & testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.  \n",

likely experienced or heard how this course is low effort, half finished garbage. Well, since they can't be bothered to fix this course, it is up to us to help each other out. This post is my attempt to help fellow students with this project. After stumbling through this project for like a month and a half, I finally finished it and here is my best attempt at a guide.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly, get your IntelliJ Ultimate downloaded, and get your project files on your local machine. Check out my previous post at to get through task step A: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, so this project basically gives you a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and a myspace looking old school HTML user interface, and your job is to customize the code to meet a customers needs. You need to come up with a shop that will have 5 sample products, and 5 generic parts that can be combined to make those products. They give the example of a bicycle shop that has different bike types for products, like mountain bike/ road bike etc. and then generic parts for those such as seat, handlebars, gears etc. Do not overthink this, just choose something and keep it simple and generic.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo know what the heck is going on, here is some background info. To get something like this to work, it is convenient to use a framework, something to contain all your different files and get them to work together the way we want, while offering tools and libraries to simplify development and let us focus on the logic and features of the application we are creating. Often used with Spring is Spring boot, a sub project of Spring that simplifies things for us even more by using embedded web servers so you don't have to install and configure a separate web server, while also offering auto-configuration, so we have less to do manually to make sure that any files/classes etc that depend on other files/classes/methods etc have the information shared to be able to carry out their functions. This project uses a common design pattern known as MVC (model view controller). This is a way to organize an applications files based on its function which promotes organization, modularization, maintainability, reusability, testability, and improves development efficiency. Now if you have opened your project, it may seem overwhelming the amount of files in there, so I am going to try to tell you what files belong to what part of MVC, and a bit about what they do so you know what you are looking at.  \\n\\n\\n**Model:** represents the applications data and business logic. Encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the app, including data manipulation, validation, and interactions with the database. The files for this project relating to the model are:\\n\\n* Entities: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->domain you have 4 .java files containing entities. These are your classes, for the different types of parts, and for products. Entities are marked with the annotation '@Entity' which tells Spring this is an entity, allowing it to work its magic to make these work the way we want overall for the application.\\n* Repositories: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->repositories you have 4 repository .java files corresponding to the entity files. Repository files allow for CRUD (create read update delete) on the database. These files interact with the database and are marked with '@Repository'. Note that these files extend CrudRepository which eliminates the need for the annotation.\\n* Service: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->service, there are service files and service implementation files. The service files contain declarations but not the definitions, while the implementation files have the definitions to implement the service. Services interact with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.\\n* Validators: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->validators, contains .java files that contains the actual validation logic, and annotation files that allow you to make a custom annotation to easily mark your other files with ('@CustomAnnotation') to get the validation enforced. Code that enforces validation rules and constraints for your data.\\n\\n**View:** responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It encompasses the user interface elements, templates, and visual elements that users interact with. Views receive data from the Model and render it in a way that's suitable for presentation. Views also capture user input and pass it to the Controller for further processing. The files for the view layer are:\\n\\n* HTML Templates: src->main>resources->templates. These are all your html files that contain the format and structure for the webpages you see. This project uses Thymeleaf, a template engine that helps make dynamic html content.\\n* CSS: found in src->main->resources->static->css. This provides additional styling for the webpages to enhance the look and feel.\\n\\n**Controller:** These classes handle user requests, process input, interact with the Model, and determine which View should be rendered. Controllers are annotated with '@Controller'. In general, a controller in a Spring application is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate HTTP response. Controllers typically have methods annotated with '@RequestMapping'(or other annotations like '@GetMapping','@PostMapping', etc.) to define the URL paths they handle and the HTTP methods they respond to. The controllers are found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->controllers.\\n\\n**Other Notable Files:** There are some files that aren't included in MVC but are still important to recognize. These are:\\n\\n* BootStrapData.java: The purpose of this class is to provide initial data for testing and development, ensuring that there is data to work with when starting the application. This file is located at src->main->java->com.example.demo->bootstrap\\n* application.properties: a configuration file in a Spring Boot application that allows you to configure various settings and properties for your application. It is used to customize the behavior of your application without requiring changes to the source code. \\n* test files: located at src->test, contains files for testing your code.\\n* .gitignore: this file is used to specify files and directories that you want ignored by git when tracking changes in your project. I did not use this file at all for this project. Is found in target directory.\\n* mvn & mvnw: These are files used to ensure the right version of Maven is being used to build the project regardless of whether you have it installed or not. Maven is a build automation and project management tool that simplifies the process of managing and building software projects by providing a structured way to handle dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging.\\n* pom.xml: is the Project Object Model configuration file used by Maven to define project details, dependencies, and build settings for a Java project.\\n* README.md: is used to provide a brief and informative description of a project, often found at the root of a repository, to help users understand its purpose and usage. We will be using this file to track the changes we make for task steps C thru J.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, hopefully that helps, I was completely lost and overwhelmed at first but hopefully that gives you some background and helps you see how the pieces fit together. If it doesn't make sense yet, it will start to as you work through the project and see how things work together and interact. Anyway, on to the tasks!\\n\\n**NOTE:** to view and test your web app, open your browser and go to localhost:8080. This will show you your webpage in its current state. You must run the application successfully in IntelliJ for this to work. You will be using this a lot to make sure your changes are working the way you want and you are meeting the requirements.  \\n\\n\\n**Task B:** This part is super easy, they want you to create a README file, but there already is one! What I did here was I kept the nice WGU and D287 header stuff deleted the rest, and then I copy and pasted the task requirements from parts C to J so I could type my changes for each part under the step it is a part of.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**NOTE:**  For tasks C - J you have to commit and push with a message to the remote repository after the completion of each step. You are allowed to push more often, but at a minimum you must push after each step is completed and put a brief meaningful message. At the end you will have to get the history and submit it with your zip file. I made a new branch to do all my changes to, and named it working\\_brach, as this is more common than doing work on the main branch. To make a new branch, go to the bottom right of the screen, click the current branch, and it will bring up some options. Click new branch, name it something like working\\_branch, and check the box for checkout branch so that you make it the branch you are working on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task C:** For this step, you will be working in mainscreen.html. You will need to customize this page to reflect your custom shop choice, changing the titles and headers appropriately. Make sure to log the changes and locations on the README. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message. You can do this by clicking the git tab and then clicking commit, and it should bring up a commit window where your project window usually is, and then you can select what changes to commit, type your message, and select commit & push. Almost every time I did this, I got warnings and it stopped the push, and I had to click push anyway. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task D:** For this part you need to understand some basic html. This step you need to make an about page, and so you will need firstly a template, so create a new html template with all your other templates (when asked if you want to add your new file to git, always say yes). This file will be where you create all the visuals for your about page, where you describe briefly your business and who its for. I just put some super generic stuff about how we care about the customer and giving back etc. I copy and pasted the first 12 or so lines from another html template just so it had the same styling and structure info as the other webpages. I personally tried to match the look of mainscreen.html, but you can make it however you want. Remember to catalogue each change you make in the README.md file. For example, if you add a title for your about page, you would put something like: -about.html: added title 'About' on line 15. You need to say what file, have it under the correct task letter, and say what line(s) the change(s) is(are) on and what the change(s) is(are). When you are satisfied with your about.html, you will need to make a controller for it in the directory with all the other controllers. The controller is being used to map the URL to  the corresponding webpage and guiding Spring on which template to utilize for rendering the content. Remember to annotate your controller with '@Controller' just like in the other controller classes, and you will also need the @GetMapping(\"name\\_of\\_about\\_template\\_here\") in your class definition to connect the template and the url such that you can reach this page and see it by going to localhost:8080/about\\_template\\_name\\_here. Check out the other controller classes to get an idea how for this, or watch a video on it if needed. On mainscreen.html, you will need to add a button that takes you to the about page you created, I just copy and pasted similar code for other buttons and changed the link for it and name to make this work. Similarly, on your about html file you will want to add a link or a button back to the mainscreen. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **Task E:** Now you need to add a sample inventory consisting of 5 products and 5 parts. There is commented out code in the BootStrapData.java file that gives you an example of how to create a part and a product (in separate spots), you can use that and change it to make 5 of each. You either need to add an if statement that checks if the parts count and products count is zero before adding the sample inventory, or you will need to comment your code out after the sample is added to your page so you don't keep adding duplicates. If you don't add the logic to check for this, make sure to make a note somewhere to uncomment this code back out before you submit your project, or it will get sent back as they will not see your sample database get loaded in. (Hint: I used variables for part count and product count and set them equal to their respective repository classes and used the .count() method to see if both were == 0 before adding the sample inventory). Once you are done, commit and push with a message. Make sure you are logging all your changes!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task F:** This step asks you to add a Buy Now button next to the update and delete buttons for your products. The button needs to decrease the inventory of the purchased product by one, and make no changes to the inventory of parts. You need to display a message for failure or success of a purchase. First I would add the button to mainscreen.html in the appropriate spot. There is a table in mainscreen.html that sets up the products table, you will see it referencing tempProduct.name, .price, .inv, and then you will see the update and delete buttons. You will want to add your Buy Now button in here. The button here is a bit tricky as you need it to map to /buyProduct URL (we will make the controller for this later) and you need to set it up for http POST request so it can access and update the inventory amount for purchased products. You also need to pass a hidden input field so that you can pass the tempProduct.id along to the controller. I would post the code for this but I don't want this post to get taken down lol. Next you need to make a new controller to handle the desired behavior of the buy now button. Once you make your controller, make sure to annotate it as a controller. For this controller I added a private ProductRepository object with an '@Autowired' annotation, as the ProductRepository provides methods for interacting with the database which we need to do to decrement the inventory by 1 after purchase, and the annotation injects an instance of ProductRepository into this controller, which allows it to use the methods it needs. Just like the other controllers, we are going to make a public String method, I called it buyProduct. For its input parameters, you need to use the '@RequestParam' annotation to be able to obtain the productID from the product that was purchased over on mainscreen. Next I created an Optional <Product> object that assigns its value to the .findById method of the product repository, using the productID obtained from '@RequestParam'. By using Optional<Product>, the code handles the possibility that the requested product might not exist in the database. It avoids directly returning null when the product is not found, which helps improve code readability and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. This object basically represents whether the product was found in the database or not. Using that, you can set up if statements based on whether that object.isPresent() is true or not, and if it is true, you can create a Product object and set it equal to the optional object.get(). You can then set up an additional if statement that checks if that products inventory (product.getInv) is above 0, if it is then you can set the inventory for it to its current value -1 (decrement the inventory like the instructions wanted). Make sure to save this new value using the product repository .save() method to save the new count to the repository. If this part of the code is reached, then the product had enough in stock to be purchased, its inventory was subtracted by one to reflect a purchase, and now you can generate a success message. There are many ways to do this (as is the case with most of the project), but I personally made a new html template both for a purchase success and a purchase error. You can use a redirect statement in your return statement to the url of your success page for the case that the purchase went through, or to your error page if it did not. You will need to add '@GetMapping' annotations and displayPurchaseSuccess (or error) methods that return to the appropriate url. After the controller is all setup, you make your html templates for the success and error pages if thats the way you chose to do. These can be super simple, basically mine just said purchase successful or purchase error in big letters when the page loaded. When everything is working and looking the way you want, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task G:** In this step you have to add max and min inventory fields for parts, modify your sample inventory to show the max and min inventory, and update both the part forms to have additional inputs for the max and min inventory. Then they want you to rename the database file, and add code that enforces that the inventory is between the max and min values. First go to Part.java, and add the minInv and maxInv fields (name em whatever you want), you can also use the same '@Min' annotation as the other fields to enforce that it cannot be below zero, and have a message with it. Be sure to also add a new constructor that includes these new fields, and make getter and setter functions for them. Next go back to BootStrapData.java and add max and min inventory values for your sample inventory parts. Then for both InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm, add text inputs for both max and min inventory. You can probably figure out how to put it in there just by seeing how the other fields are put in there and copying it but changing as necessary. Then rename the database file, it will look something like this **spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db** you can find it in file explorer or finder and right click it and rename it to whatever you like. In the application.properties file, you will need to rename it there as well and make sure they match. Next I would create a method in Part.java that checks if an inventory is valid, by returning true if the inventory falls between the max and min values, and returns false otherwise. For both inhouse and outsourced part controller files, add logic that uses the isInvValid method you created to generate an error message if the inventory is outside of range. I used BindingResult to reject bad values with a message, look into this for the error messaging. Once this is working as expected and desired, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task H:** This step wants you to add additional error messages and more specific error messages, one for if the inventory is below the minimum, one for if the inventory is above the maximum, and one for if adding/updating a product would cause an associated part to fall below the minimum. This isn't too bad, adding some more if else type logic to both inhouse and outsourced part controllers will take care of the first two conditions I listed. For the last requirement, I edited EnufPartsValidator.java with some additional requirements in the if statement that returns false to check if any of the parts for the product would fall below their minimum if the product was made (Hint: p.getInv() - 1 < p.getMinInv()). I also updated the error message from ValidEnufParts to be more specific. When you are happy with the results and everything has been tested and working, commit with a message and push. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task I:** Add two unit tests to the PartTest class for the maximum and minimum inventory fields. The course resources has a video for this. You go to the file, and use the '@Test' annotation, and then make two tests that look similar to the tests already in this file. For min, you can set the minimumInv to a number that you expect to be the lowest to be used for the program, its just an arbitrary test number. Then you use partIn and set its value to the variable you just assigned, and use assertEquals() to make sure that it works as expected. Repeat for partOut. Do all this again but for maximumInv. Thats it for this one. When it is working, commit and push with message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task J:** Remove the class files for any unused validators. This one was so simple it had me doubting myself. When you open the validators, it will tell you how many usages intellij recognized for them. One of them had no usages so I deleted that one. It was really that simple lol. Commit and push with a message. This is the last step that needs to be tracked in the read me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow double check you meet all the rubric requirements, watch the completed project video from the course resources and make sure you got all the right stuff, and when you are satisfied and everything is working, export your project to a ZIP. Next on Gitlab, go to the code tab on the left hand side, expand it with a click and then select repository graph. This shows your commit and push history and must be turned in. Use print button and then specify print to PDF, and save it to your computer. You must turn this in with your project ZIP. Finally, get the url for your gitlab by clicking the blue clone button and copying the https url. When you submit, you need the ZIP, the repository graph, and the URL. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI hope this guide helps, please let me know of any mistakes or typos, I wanted to do this quickly and move on to my next course. If you have questions feel free to ask, but just know I stumbled my way through this and by no means to I understand everything or am an expert. This guide does not constitute the right way, best way, only way, or most efficient way to do this project. It is just what worked for me. I tried to tell you as much as possible without just giving things away and getting in trouble lol.  When you guys finish this course, make sure to let them know honestly how you feel about the course in the end of course survey! Best of luck. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;  \n",



Adventure\\nJuly seems to be a good month for me. July 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from WGU in Business Management. After that was done, I wrote this post, to give my take on the \"Sort of\" acceleration I did through my undergrad studies. It's a long read...but...if you want context for this post...feel free to give it a skim: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu\\_bs\\_in\\_business\\_management\\_the\\_sortof/geijacp/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu_bs_in_business_management_the_sortof/geijacp/?context=3)\\n\\nFast forward to July 2021...and I just completed my MBA at WGU as well. Like I said...July seems to be my jam. My first Graduate Term at WGU started in October 2020, so I accelerated two years of course work, into a little less than 10 months. Not too shabby. \\n\\nNow, you've likely seen other posts. \"I accelerated my Bachelors degree (or MBA) in 2 weeks\" or something of the like. My point here, is the same as it was last time: I'm not racing anyone. I applaud those who were able to do in minutes what took me months. However, for those who are still with me here...keep in mind I work full time in the Tech sector as a Senior Program Manager, I coach high school athletics on the side, and I have a family that I happen to enjoy spending time with. That's why I title my posts as a \"sort of\" acceleration. I don't have every hour of my day to devote to classwork so I can hammer out 11 classes in 11 days; but I want to give back to the WGU subreddit, because I got a lot of assists from these posts and I want to help others, who may only be looking for a kick in the arse that they can do it too. I did what I could in the evenings to devote to my school work, and on weekends too. But, I really didn't sacrifice an entire weekend to school at any point. I enjoy sipping my coffee. I also just happened to have an Appendicitis during my MBA Adventure, so that didn't exactly help my cause! \\n\\nI gave a lot of advice and pro-tips in my Bachelor's Degree post above. But, I'll reiterate the important ones here, up front:   \\n\\n\\n**1)** Get a Business Calculator, (I bought the BA II Plus) and learn it. *Know thy calculator*. It will save you a LOT of time. \"But, hey OP. I have a graphing calculator. I'm good.\" Sure, but, you could be better off. The Business Calculator, when you get into the Financing Courses will legit save you a ton of time. \\n\\n**2)** Be nice to your exam proctors. They work in a call center for God knows how many hours a day, watching people take exams. Sometimes they'll ask you to do something that no other proctor asks you to do. Just, go with it. Sometimes I was asked to take off my Smart Watch, sometimes, I wasn't. Sometimes I was asked to take my hand away from my face during exams (I tend to rest my chin on my hands during exams); other times, I wasn't asked to do that. Sometimes I quietly talk through an exam question to myself, and sometimes the proctor would chime in and ask me if I was talking to someone in the room, and I'd have to rotate the camera to show I was alone; and sometimes it didn't matter at all. But, there's no need to make your proctored exams more stressful then they may already be. Just go with the flow. They're human, just like you and I are, and there isn't a single proctor out there like \"I'm totally going to try and get this person to fail their exam\". Be kind. \\n\\n**3)** Be patient when you submit papers for grading. They have three days to return it to you. *Pro-Tip*: if you can avoid it, try to get your papers submitted before the end of the month. There is legitimately a term ending at the end of every month; so the volume increases a lot at the end of the month. I generally found papers I'd turn in, in the middle of the month would get graded in 12-36 hours; whereas at the end of the month, you can bank on it taking all three days. For whatever it's worth to you. \\n\\n**4)** Regarding papers: I said it before, I will repeat myself: Follow. The. Rubric. Every. Single. Word. Of. It. If you deviate from the Rubric, it doesn't matter how much you write, or how eloquent you are, or what your experience is in professional writing in your career. You will get your paper returned. You could write War and Peace, and get your paper returned. Or, you could follow the Rubric, write two pages, and pass. Just give them what they ask for, because that's what they're looking for to grade.\\n\\n**5)** It's okay to fall behind a bit, or to stall out a bit. My term started in October 2020. I didn't even get to open the first course until November, because of a work deadline. You can catch up. In the MBA program, you have six months to complete three classes. Anything else, is gravy. \\n\\n**6)** Take the Pre-Assessment straight-away when starting a class with a proctored exam. Have no fear. There is no penalty for getting crushed on the Pre-Assessment, and there's no limit to the number of times you can take it. But, you want the Assessment Report at the end of it. It will not only tell you the weight of each section to better help you study, but will also give you an answer key to see what you missed. As a bonus, if you pass it, it unlocks your Proctored Exam (Objective Assessment/OA) right away, so you can schedule it. I took the Pre-Assessment straight-away for every class I had with an exam, and it helped me shore up where I was weak, and I saved time by not studying sections I aced. \\n\\n**7)** Get a Quizlet account. You're welcome.\\n\\nHere we go:   \\n\\n\\nThere are eleven courses to complete for your MBA. Six of them have a Proctored Exam, five are written papers. The Data Driven Decision Making course (C207) has both Proctored Exam, and two papers to write. I'm going through them, in the order I took them, over the course of ten months (one, six-month term, and then three and a half months of a second term). I took some cues from a post by [https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) and his Mega Thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/). I always like to give credit where it's due. They had a bit of a different journey than I did, but we also had some similarities. But, I did draw some inspiration from their post, which is why it looks similar! \\n\\n**Managing Organizations and Leading People (C200)** *– Two Papers*   \\nThey ease you in with a pretty easy class up front. First up, get the Signature Themes Assessment out of the way. I think it took me about a half hour ish. Download the result, and start in on your papers. I wrote both papers over the course of two days. Paper 1 wants you to talk about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Paper 2 is for you to use a situation with a real organization, but you have to redact the info, and make up fake names. Then you write about a leader you know in the org. No reinvention of the wheel here. \\n\\n**Managing Human Capital (C202)** *– One Proctored Exam (OA)*   \\nThis class was super chill. Honestly, anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content here as common workplace knowledge. Not necessarily every word, but you know what I mean. I took the pre-assessment straight-away without looking at a single word of the course, passed it, and then scheduled my OA for that weekend to give me a couple days to study where I was weak. Took my OA a couple days later, and passed. \\n\\n**Management Communication (C204)** *– One Paper, One PowerPoint & Video + One Executive Summary*   \\nPaper 1 involves writing up a few emails and letters to your staff, your industry contact and your shareholders of your company that distributes a hot and fancy new product, depending on your chosen scenario. you pick. This is a class to have fun with. Level of Difficulty is not high at all. After Paper 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow. The. Rubric. Then you make a Panopto video. It's very easy. You download and install the Panopto (or use the web version). When it opens, add your PowerPoint you created, and start recording your presentation. My video was about 8 1/2 minutes, and I passed on the first attempt. Then write your Executive Summary of your PPTX and submit the lot. This all took me about a work week in the evenings, but if you had a weekend you could probably hammer it out in a full day, maybe two.\\n\\n**Marketing (C212)** *– One Paper*   \\nI've seen other posts calling this paper a monster. I respectfully disagree. Mine was ten pages, including the title page, table of contents and references. So, my actual content was seven pages long. Just follow the Rubric. I've seen other posts where they wrote 16+ pages. They must reeeeeeeeeally love writing more than I do. I don't add a lot of fluff. Just write what they ask for. You are tasked with writing a proposal for a hot new product from any of seven provided industries. (I work in the Technology sector, so I chose Technology.) This took me about a week, but I started this class the day after Thanksgiving. So, between Turkey Coma and Black Friday (which, let's be honest...due to COVID-19, there wasn't really a Black Friday, as much as there was me not wanting to look at school while I made leftover stuffing...and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...)\\n\\nI'm grouping the next two together. C213 and C214. Here comes that need for the Business Calculator. Friendly Reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Let it do the work for you. My best advice is this: Do whatever you must with your Program Mentor to get them to schedule these two back-to-back. Bribe them, beg them, or simply ask them. Taking C214 immediately after C213 is a game changer, as they tie into one another like Cookies and Cream. I asked my mentor about it; he sort of waffled; so I asked again, and he adjusted my Degree Plan so I could take them back-to-back. \\n\\n**Accounting for Decision Makers (C213)** *– One OA*  \\nThere are some calculations and math, but not too terribly much. I've seen other posts that say \"don't worry about the math, just focus on all the other class material and you'll be good\". False. Disagree. Nope. Spend time on the math. There's enough math on the exam that if you bomb the math, you're going to essentially need to be perfect on the rest of the exam to pass. I have a strategy on any sort of Finance, Statistics, or Math exams that include theory questions as well. I do the non-math related questions first. If I get to a question that includes an equation, I skip it, and come back to it. Save all the math to last, that way once I switch my brain to calculations, I don't have to switch it back. For me, that's helps bring down the stress level. (Having a beer with me during the exam also helps. Just saying.) I used the same strategy for Financial Management. This one took me four days, because I had a weekend in there that I could devote 2-3 hours at a time to, here and there. Otherwise, probably would have taken a week or so, with after work studying.\\n\\n**Financial Management (C214)** – *One OA*   \\nAnother reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Especially if you've never used a financial calculator before. All the formulas you need will be given to you on the Pre-Assessment and the OA, you don’t have to remember any of them. You'll find many things from C213 carry over here, so that's nice...and the reason I say do whatever you can to take this immediately after C213. Memorize the Financial Concepts as best you can. The math won’t be crazy tough, especially if you *Know thy calculator*. There are more non-math questions than there are finance math questions, but don't skimp on learning the math. Last thing you want is to start second guessing your non-math question answers, because you're not feeling too confident about the Finance Math questions. This one took me two weeks, an hour here and an hour there. \\n\\n**Ethical Leadership (C206)** – *Three Papers*   \\nI admit it. Writing papers bores me to death. With an exam, I can get in, hammer it out, and be done. Not so much with papers. But, c'est la vie. Another easy one, just a time suck because of having to write not one, not two, but ***three*** papers. Blah. First up, do the “Ethical Lens Inventory” task in the course itself. Pretty sure this took me a half hour or so. For Paper 1, write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. I used someone I used to work for. But, I've seen other posts that they wrote about Lincoln, etc. Write about different leadership concepts. For Paper 2, write about social responsibility and leadership. For Paper 3, write about the code of ethics and its various leadership applications. All three papers, including citations, was a total of 21 pages of writing. Took me two weeks, but in fairness, I was doing this right before Christmas, and decorating the tree, watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and wrapping presents took priority. I'm not sorry. :-)\\n\\n**Data-Driven Decision Making (C207)** – *Two Papers and One OA*   \\nI've read other posts basically calling this class The Devil. Like, bust out the Exorcism for this class, and burn it at the stake for heresy. Honestly, I didn't think it was all that horrible. But, I enjoy data, so to each their own. It took me three weeks. First, form a hypothesis, then you complete Paper 1, which is a form they provide, and turn it in. Then, the data fun starts. Follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis option from the list. I will say this, don't overly complicate things, regardless of how much you like data. Use the T-Test. It's the simplest one, requiring the least amount of data, and therefore has the least friction. You could choose others, but that's like deciding to run a full marathon when you registered for a half-marathon. Not like you're going to get two medals for finishing. Anyways, plot the numbers in Excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for 30 data points. (*Pro-Tip*: Make sure you have the add-on installed in Excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions if you don't). You have to write Paper 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. I was able to get data from my wife's place of work, so this probably made things easier for me too. After Paper 2 passes, then it's time for the OA. Remember when I said \"Get a Quizlet account\" up above? You should use it here. If you're not a data person, take your time. Data isn't an easy topic for many people, so put on your Patience Hat, and grab a beer while you study. \\n\\n**Operations Management (C215)** – *One OA*   \\nSo, I've spent some of my career in Ops Management, so I breezed through this one. I wish I had some pearls of wisdom to share here. I was done in four days, and that's only because the closest OA I could schedule when I wasn't at work...or at near midnight was four days after I took the Pre-Assessment. Topics included supply/demand, operations and employee functions, and process improvement. But again, I've worked in this field, and when I passed the Pre-Assessment with Exemplary across the board, I didn't even bother to crack the study material. So, you may want to search for another sub-Reddit thread that goes into detail here.  \\n\\n**Global Economics for Managers (C211)** – *One OA*   \\nIf you pay even a small bit of attention to business environments, the economy, currency exchange, global corporation behavior, this won’t be a headache. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge on my part. I took the pre-assessment right away as per usual, then scheduled the OA for later that week. Took about 6 days from start to finish. But, this was my last OA, and a cause for celebration! \\n\\n**MBA Capstone (C216)** – *One Business Simulation + Three Papers*   \\nPaper 1 is a PowerPoint presentation + Panopto video (Exactly like C204 above). Task 2 is a pretty lengthy paper as a Stockholder Report (mine was 19 pages); Paper 3 is basically submitting your resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and a tiny paper on what you learned during the MBA that helped you on the Capstone Simulation (mine was 5 total pages, including the cover page and Table of Contents). \\n\\nOf all the courses I have taken with WGU, including my Undergraduate course load, this was by far my most favorite. An actual workplace simulation of opening your own small business. There is a lot of work to do for this course, as there should be for a culminating final of a graduate level degree program. All up, I spent close to three weeks on this sucker. I could have done it faster, but I wanted my presentations to be air tight. Also...above I mentioned an Appendicitis. Well, this is when it hit, was during my Capstone. So, take that into consideration as well. Start off with the simulation. The simulation consists of a start-up business and it's first six quarters of operation that you have to get through. After you get to the end of Q4, you have to stop and that is the information you use for Paper 1 (the PPTX presentation/video) to justify your decisions you've made up to that point.  You actually cannot progress to Q5 and Q6 in the simulation until you pass Paper 1. Don't forget: Follow. The. Rubric. To. The. Letter. This is basically a sales pitch to potential investors in your business. Also, this is where you have to be in professional dress for the camera, so ditch the hoodie and put on a collared shirt. *Pro-Tip 1*: Submit Paper 1, then submit Q4 in the Simulation, in that order. Don't submit your Q4 decisions before turning in the Paper. *Pro-Tip 2*: Do the \"Final Check\" each quarter before you submit your results. Don't deviate from that. You can really screw yourself if you muck something up and submit it. The Final Check looks for errors. Once you pass Paper 1, you'll be able to move on to Q5 and Q6. \\n\\nNext, you'll complete the final two quarters, then comes Paper 2, the Stockholder Report. To beat the long dead horse, Follow. The. Rubric. This isn't going to be a short paper, so buckle up, and knuckle down. This paper is written as a narrative, so don't use the Bullet Points from the Task 2 explanations. You don't want it written as a Book Report; you want to tell the graders a story about why you did what you did, and when you did it, and why you did it.  You'll download reports from the simulation, and take screenshots, and have appendices. But, you can do it, because you're storytelling. Since you made the decisions along the way, you know why you did what you did. You just have to explain it, like you're telling a story about it. I found it to be very fun, and I learned quite a bit by doing it. Again, easily my most favorite class I took at WGU. Once this one is submitted, you're basically in the clear. All the grinding work is done, and Paper 3 awaits...and...they sure do lob you a softball on this one to swing at.\\n\\nPaper 3 is writing a quick explanation of of three competencies you used throughout the MBA program that helped you successfully complete the simulation. You'll then create a SMART goal about your career. Then you discuss and attach three artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification or other that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future. (I used my undergrad degree, and two professional certifications I have - my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and my PMP Certification as my three.) Then update your resume (make sure WGU is listed as the latest school with the expected degree end month and year). Then, print off your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or create a profile if you don't have one). But...don't trip at the finish line! **Follow. The. Rubric.** You don't want the final thing you have to do to be having to re-do a cupcake Paper because you hit Auto-Pilot. Submit the lot. Once you punch submit that last time, sit back and remember Advice Point 3 from above, about being patient while they grade papers. Head to the pub, and drink a well earned beer. Maybe add some Chili-Cheese Fries, for posterity. Just sit and wait to see the good news email hit your Inbox with that glorious subject line \"**You Passed!**\" You did it!!! You made a choice to get your MBA...and now...it's yours! Your program mentor will call or email you very soon. They'll gush about how awesome you did. You'll get an email from Records, that your Mentor submitted you for graduation. Fill that application out when the email comes through. It'll take a couple days to process your degree; and within a couple weeks, you'll get a digital degree you can use online, and shortly thereafter, a package from your Mail Carrier with a super rad piece of paper within, declaring that WGU certifies you to be a master of all things business administration related!\\n\\nCongratulations to you, you're now the proud owner of a Graduate Degree. Now, when you see career opportunities that say \"MBA Required\"; you get to smile; and that's a pretty rad feeling. \\n\\nAnd to you...yes you...reading this wondering if you should enroll. You have obligations. You don't know if you can carve out the time. You work yourself to the bone, and barely have time to sleep. You can do it. I legit work 50+ hour weeks, then I go coach high school sports, then I like to have free time and spend it with my family. Oh...one other thing...I also run marathons competitively. Do you know how long a 23 mile training run takes on a Sunday morning? You don't want to know. But, I made a decision. I knew I could sacrifice some time to open doors that were closed to me previously. Because, it doesn't take forever to get that MBA. It only takes a little time, right now. The longer you delay, the longer it will be before you finish. \\n\\nYou can do it. You can. You just have to make the choice. I don't know you. I will never meet you. I don't know your story, or how you got to where you are right now that lead you to this post. But...I believe in you. But, me believing in you isn't good enough. YOU have to believe in you too. So, stop reading this, and get cracking on that MBA. It's already printed off. It just needs to know your name so it can find it's way to your mailbox and live out it's days, decorating your wall in a diploma frame. :-)\\n\\nGood luck!  \n",



classes)\\nThis is a guide to how I did my **MBA** at WGU (in **19 Days)**\\n\\n**I  moved my post over from the other subreddit, as I wanted to  specifically help people who are looking for information related to the  Business degree, specifically, the MBA.**\\n\\nThis  is a full, per course, write up of how I experienced each course, and  what I did to pass. This is only to let people know how “I” did it.  Please don’t take this as a “be all end all”. I take no responsibility  for your progress, and everyone has to put in their work. I would love  to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any  kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it. You can  do it, but remember that everyone is different.\\n\\nI  will however, link you to a blank APA template I used for all my  papers. It is formatted with headers and everything, with a brief  explanation of the sections. I used this template for all my papers.

If  you are planning to start soon and wanna break my record, Go for it!  Also, if you are already started, but wanna try to accelerate, hopefully  a little from this write-up can help you too! The goal is to finish,  even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast!  I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however,  anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I  personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before  I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back  a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use  this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes  relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore  we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s  coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will  suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting  your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*,  that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est  this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est  re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not  pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*.  If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of  thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass  before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*,  and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2  days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est  thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then  add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try. Go here:  [**https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl**](https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl)\\n\\nC204 – Management Communication – **Very Easy Class. 1 Paper, 1 PowerPoint Presentation and Video + 1 Executive Summary**.  This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job  well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qc5bhx6kre051.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18e976844dd1590b122f3580644ec34cbf84c5d8)  \n",

(Master of Business Administration) Course MEGA Thread (Also relevant to some MSML classes)\\nThis is a guide to how I did my **MBA** at WGU (in **19 Days)**\\n\\n**I moved my post over from the other subreddit, as I wanted to specifically help people who are looking for information related to the Business degree, specifically, the MBA.**\\n\\nThis is a full, per course, write up of how I experienced each course, and what I did to pass. This is only to let people know how “I” did it. Please don’t take this as a “be all end all”. I take no responsibility for your progress, and everyone has to put in their work. I would love to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it. You can do it, but remember that everyone is different.\\n\\nI will however, link you to a blank APA template I used for all my papers. It is formatted with headers and everything, with a brief explanation of the sections. I used this template for all my papers. You can download it from my google drive:\\n\\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6FWjGvKR5H7DCgRaLvpmh5rssFz-0RS/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6FWjGvKR5H7DCgRaLvpmh5rssFz-0RS/view?usp=sharing)\\n\\nPlease feel free to copy **any and all** methods for use, but again, please remember, everyone is different! If you are planning to start soon and wanna break my record, Go for it! Also, if you are already started, but wanna try to accelerate, hopefully a little from this write-up can help you too! The goal is to finish, even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast! I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however, anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**. If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails, then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins. Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours + Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week. Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the 9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**. First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment, then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2 took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names. Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization. Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.** This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content of this class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance** of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens” the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA. If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try.

This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video, using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7 minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**. This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3 papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about 20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work. Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task 1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3 papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**. This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**. Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15 separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References*** page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from. Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.( Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love, love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class** I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3 freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**. I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me, it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards, passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially in this current political climate with the current president and the state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked, then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**. This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1 paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**. This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets, passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment. Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out. Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**. For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY** formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not, I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management, same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3 math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable, just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**, to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself. Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones, skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on. Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**. I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand, operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with, along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always, then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1 PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**. This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace” conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6 “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game. And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators) and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass, you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity** that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about 15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.) Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in, it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2 and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim, then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past. Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin, create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy. Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA. Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree. Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gnvb6f2ere051.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=716b83558c25039900e6965c1d264339be2dea09)  \n",

                                               One-Term MBA Thread\\nSpecial shout-out to [u/Sleyk2010](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) &  [u/Hypermatrix2075](https://www.reddit.com/user/Hypermatrix2075/) your threads totally helped me 1/ understand that it was possible to accelerate and 2/ how to actually do it! You also inspired me to keep a little log of what helped me, and I thought I would post it in case it could help others. This is a thread that introduces me, why I went with WGU, resources that helped me, a class-by-class breakdown, and my overall thoughts after finishing.\\n\\n# A little bit about me:\\n\\nI have a degree in business that I got from a traditional university. I have worked in marketing in corporate America for the past 7 years and have been in business classes for 15 years. I do not have any kids and my work schedule is pretty light. I didn’t plan on accelerating through this program when I signed up, the original plan was 18-months or 1-year if I really pushed myself. After research I found out It really is doable in one-term. For me that meant committing large chunks of time at once - If you have a family, outside obligations, aren’t familiar with business, and/or work 60+ hours a week - do not compare your progress to me because idk how you’re doing this at all, you're awesome. Lots of folks in these situations finish in one term as well, but I think they approach the program differently. I also have a natural affinity for multiple-choice tests and while I am not a stellar writer - Grammarly and forced motivation work wonders.\\n\\nI wanted my master’s degree because it’s always been a goal, my work was paying for it, it helps qualify me for more senior roles, and I would really like to teach community college/university later in life (I know an MBA isn’t required, but it's nice to have). I didn’t need a fancy degree from a top MBA program because I already have a great job and do not have the time/patience to commit to a brick & mortar approach. I had always heard about WGU, but once I looked into it: it served my purposes, is non-profit, and pretty well respected - so I was sold!\\n\\n## How I prepared:\\n\\nI got everything squared away with registration about a month before my term started and I used that time to prepare as much as I could. I read the reddit threads and Facebook groups a ton. I did a lot of general internet searching too because I wanted to learn about WGU, how people approached classes, studied, etc.\\n\\nI then started a google doc I called “MBA Resources'' as a way to put everything I thought might be helpful in one place. I listed out links to overall resources (threads, groups, websites) and then made sections for each of the 11 classes. Under each class I highlighted the deliverables for each class (1 Exam/OA, 2 PAs/Papers) and pasted the class-specific paragraph from each reddit mega thread. Lastly, as I read and searched the Facebook group, I compiled resources under each class on the google doc (ex. Dr. V’s bootcamp for C207, quizlet link, etc.) That way when I enrolled in the class I didn’t need to hunt for things. I could scroll in my resource document and read each person’s experience with the class and see resources that people found helpful. I didn’t necessarily know what everything meant or where it would be in the portal, but it offered me a place to start once I enrolled in a particular course. When I finished a course, I moved it to the completed section and wrote my own little paragraph that I would later post as this mega-thread. This approach really served me well, when I (finally) received access to my classes I had a good understanding of how the program worked, knew what generally to expect, and had a place to start when entering each new course.\\n\\n## Resources:\\n\\n● [WGU Course List Guide - Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1clcNTu5cHTbPa6IZfamRF4BoF0fyca6Jned0HePtcB0/htmlview?fbclid=IwAR1GV-x4dwprk79gK_WsNFfbOD3XoaPhD6qJUuHi_SmzMk9im-g8IK6DAv0)\\n\\n● [Masters of Business Administration - Night Owl Pro Tips](https://nightowlprotips.com/?page_id=39)\\n\\n● Grammarly Premium Discount - [https://gram.ly/DSDq](https://gram.ly/DSDq)\\n\\n● Free Office 365 (This is great to have for PowerPoint and as a final check for papers before you turn them in.

The math classes provide formula sheets, and every test has a pre-assessment which will give you a great place to start the materials. Definitely look up how to set-up your webcam, I ended up doing exams at my dining room table because my office had too much stuff around (screens, junk etc.)\\n\\nPerformance Assessments - I was scared going into this because a lot of the feedback from folks who were drafting 10-15 page papers. My longest paper was my marketing and capstone papers which were hovered around 10-15 with visuals and an appendix. Most papers aren't that long, as long as you are addressing each section w/ supported citation where required you will be fine - these don’t have to be novels. Getting to your point concisely is a huge skill needed for work in business.\\n\\nGrading - This can take up to three days, but I don't think I ever waited more than a day or two. If you’re anxious like me, your best avenue for notifications is text messages. Opt-in to the text notifications, save the number and give it a different text tone, that way you know the moment something comes back. The app notifications are never current, and the emails are a bit delayed.\\n\\nThe Three Rules of WGU Coursework (Updated from my view)\\n\\n● Papers/PA’s: Follow the Rubric, every single time. (Seriously, use it as your outline)\\n\\n● Exams/OA’s: Start with the pre-assessment (most of the time), then move on to the flashcards and study guides, and fill in with resources as needed. Once you feel ready, schedule that test so you have the motivation to study. Whether it's a few hours from now or this weekend… Having that set time is going to help you get ready. Study your PA just before you take it. Breathe and relax.\\n\\n● Exams and Papers: If your paper has revisions or you fail your OA don’t be discouraged!\\n\\na. Exams - Study again and retake. (No more than a few days)\\n\\nb. Papers - Review the evaluator’s comments and add in the missed or omitted work and resubmit. Make sure to reference your updates in the notes section of your additional attempt. (Try for the same day)\\n\\n# MBA Courses\\n\\n## C200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People\\n\\n## Deliverables: 2 Papers; 0 Exams\\n\\nThis class was quick, writing the first paper was like riding a bike but it started slowly. I carved out the day to write the paper (outlined with the rubric and just started plugging away). The WGU Library works great to find sources, you only need three sources for one section of each paper. The first paper I filled in all the sections and made sure my sources were cited and did a Grammarly run through and submitted. I started the second paper but that's when motivation left, and I pivoted to C202. I revisited the paper the next day after passing my C202 OA which was the motivation I needed to tackle this paper. I liked this second paper a lot less but just wrote about my former workplace - used the rubric as an outline, found the sources and submitted. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C202 – Managing Human Capital\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nThe popular quizlet people use was more reflective of the Pre-OA than the test and according to my Pre-OA there were a few wrong answers on it too (be careful out their folks, not all resources are created equal). I would stick to book end of chapter quizzes instead of using the quizlet. I just took the Pre-OA and studied what I got wrong, definitely focused on the laws. Find a mindset that’s a balance between HR being “the good guy” but also you are there to protect the company, that's where the right answers are. I took the Pre-OA and then set my test for 1.5 hours later, studied in between that time and passed. (1 Day)\\n\\n## C204 – Management Communication\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Paper, 1 PPT & Video, 1 Exec Summary\\n\\nThis class is very doable, make sure you address the main chunks of the chosen situation but, outside of that go with where your mind wanders. If you’ve worked in business, writing these comms should be cake. Once you’ve finished, evaluate them as an outside party using your own thought processes and concepts from the book. For task two I used my communications from Task 1 to guide my presentation and exec summary. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C211 – Global Economics for Managers\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nI took macro/micro in undergrad, so this material was somewhat familiar (once I reviewed the materials). I used a teach-back PowerPoint from the MBA Facebook group that someone made which was super useful - I created physical flashcards from this. I should have reviewed this entirely before taking the Pre-OA but didn't because it was so long. I ended up barely passing and scheduling my exam for the next day to force myself to study. Once you review the PPT, take the Pre-OA (don't take the quizlet before the Pre-OA - it’s the exact questions), and then study that Pre-OA because while the questions weren’t the same on the OA the concepts were similar/adjacent. Once you review these, move on to the 267-question Quizlet and review the top 3 areas annotated PowerPoint decks (the professor emailed to me after passing the Pre-OA) - these were amazing. I actually found the OA easier than the Pre-OA but, that’s probably because I was prepared. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C206 – Ethical Leadership\\n\\n## Deliverables: 3 Papers; 0 Exam\\n\\nI really didn’t want to do this class to the point where I forced myself to complete the first task and rewarded myself with pivoting to ECON (?). I did get to write about someone in music as a leader which was fun. The megathreads weren’t lying; this was tedious but, like any PA, just start tackling sections and hop around if needed. This is the first class my PAs needed revisions because I either missed the mark on a point or completely forgot something, but just addressed those highlighted areas and ended up passing the second time around. (6 Days)\\n\\n## C213 Accounting for Decision Makers\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nFairly basic accounting class, I would start off by taking the PA to gauge my understanding of the concepts and test out how you work out the calculations. I took three accounting classes in undergrad, so I knew I just needed a refresher. This was the first PA I didn’t score competent on but was still able to schedule the OA (I think because I was close?). I went through the PA question by question studying the answers and looking up concepts/terms in the book. The same cheat sheet you get on the PA is on the OA - which is so helpful. I saw someone say they didn’t need a calculator or whiteboard for this class and that’s BS - the math isn’t hard but, I needed both. The quizlet was helpful for the terms but, I actually just ran through the PA again (mainly to work through the math). (1 Day)\\n\\n## C212 – Marketing\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Paper\\n\\nOffta had this class open longer than a week because I did not want to write this paper. I am a marketer by trade, what was I doing?!?! The trouble was getting started and committing to the products. I think the global aspect also threw me, I outlined this paper and then did not return for a long while. But, in reality this paper is a piece of cake - commit to two products from a business you know and pick a US-like country to expand in. Detail how you would roll those products out, highlighting some book aspects for what you should look out for when thinking globally. I ended up writing the paper in one very long afternoon - it doesn’t have to be as long as the threads lead you to believe. (2 Weeks)\\n\\n## C207 – Data-Driven Decision Making (Rev4)\\n\\n## Deliverables: 2 Papers (2 Analysis + 2 Reports), 1 Exam\\n\\nAfter finishing 7 classes in just over a month this is where I hit a wall. I opened this class, made a paper outline and then just didn’t come back to it for over a month. It really is not hard; it is just tedious and disorganized. Everyone is at their own pace and there is no shame in taking a break if you need one - just make sure you come back.\\n\\nAs far as the PAs, there is an outline of responses for Task 1 in the Facebook group which is good to help you think about what to address where. The set-up for this class changed mid-2022 so you are given the data for both tasks rather than choosing it yourself, which I think is better. Each task has associated videos to do the analysis and practice documents which help illustrate what you need to do for the papers. These were invaluable. I dragged my feet here but kept coming back, adding a little every now and then over about a week.\\n\\nI took the pre-assessment after finishing the tasks without any preparation just to gauge where I was. I didn’t pass and then closed my laptop for yet another month -\\_- I then sucked in up and studied the Pre-OA answers, used a study guide from the Facebook group, and then reviewed some decks from the instructor (Chapter 2 & 5 / 6 expresses, the “Are You Smarter Than a C207 grader?”). Pay special attention to the top competencies, but don’t overthink it. I set my OA for 7 hours ahead of time and used that time to cram. (9 Weeks, yikes…only about 1.5 weeks of actual work)\\n\\n## C215 – Operations Management\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nThis one for me was pretty straight forward, I took the exam the day after I passed the c207 exam. I think you could do it either way because there is definitely some overlap with C207. I took the pre-assessment blind and got just under competent. From there I used a study guide from the FB group and studied the section I totally bombed, which was the JIT section. The Terms/Definitions and Glossary PDFs from the course resource page were really helpful. I work in program/project management so it was cool to learn about where a lot of that methodology comes from and the origins make a lot more sense in the manufacturing sense. The OA was harder than the pre-assessment (study pre-OA and expand on those concepts). Pay special attention to plan concepts and layouts. (1 Day)\\n\\n## C214 – Financial Management\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Exam\\n\\nI procrastinated on this class and should have taken it right after 213, but c'est la vie. This class gets a pretty bad wrap, but it is not that difficult. The pre-assessment is not really indicative of the OA in my opinion. I would learn how to use the calculator first and then go ahead and take the pre-assessment. There is a great calculator overview video in the class resources section and an excel document that takes you step by step keystrokes for the common problems. Once you do that, study the Pre-OA to make sure you can schedule your exam (a few of the questions will be on the OA, but not many). Once you feel comfy with the math & pre-OA - learn the 222 questions quizlet backwards and forwards - this is the bulk of the OA.\\n\\nI signed-up for a free Quizlet+ trial in order to use the “Learn” feature for the entire thing. This will take you through the questions again and again until you’ve got them down. After you do that, schedule your exam. I then generated a 100-quesiton test on quizlet and practiced the math (PV, FV, and especially Bond equations) using your BAII Plus. Outside of those equations you have a formula sheet which can help you figure out the other math and some of the questions on the OA. (2 Days)\\n\\n## C216 – MBA Capstone\\n\\n## Deliverables: 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1 PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 paper and 1 portfolio (resume, summary of competencies learned, LinkedIn profile, career/edu examples).\\n\\nBelieve it or not I attended a business camp in high school (I know I am so cool). We spent the week doing a business simulation where we produced a product (I think mp3 players?). Really the only difference is we got to do the task as a group and submitted paper decisions (vintage). They weren’t lying, it was college level, because three years later I did it for my bachelor's capstone (I can’t remember what the product was for this one, but that was group thing too) and now here we are again but this time...you're on your own, kid. Make sure you read the industry news/memos, stick to your plan, anticipate needs/demands - you will be fine. I suggest really investing in fixed capacity and the follow-up study findings.\\n\\nTask 1 is a recap of where you are at halfway through and asking for 2.5 million in VC money. After you complete the first few quarters, you will fill out the tactical plan in QA4 which is just educated guesses for what will happen in the next three quarters. Make sure you fill that out and download it before submitting Q4. The presentation is pretty simple, make sure you use their template and read the notes section, you can also check out YouTube for a few example presentations. After you have recorded your video, submit task one (link to video, PPT file, and the tactical plan). Once you submit the task then you can submit Q4 in the sim (everything should already be filled out) - then you have to wait until the task passes for Q5 to get unlocked. While you wait, I suggest working on task 3. You need to collect some materials and identify three competencies from the other courses you used for the simulation and will use in the future. Work on it but don't submit it until you’ve submitted task 2.\\n\\nOnce you get approval on task 1 you can go back to the simulation and finish up the rest, you only need a total score of .001 so it’s totally doable and goes much faster this time if you put in work the first few quarters. Once you finish up the simulation you can get to work on the paper. Mine ended up being super long because of the enormous number of screenshots - the write-up itself is not too bad, but make sure you do it either as you make decisions or right after you finish the sim. I used the capstone Facebook group a lot for templates/outlines/questions to make sure I was addressing everything correctly. As always, follow the rubric and you will be a-okay. Make sure to download the required CBS and CCS files and submit those along with your paper.\\n\\nAfter you have submitted Task 2 you can submit task 3, make sure all of your artifacts have your name on them - mine came back for revisions because they couldn’t “attribute” it to me.\\n\\nAfter that you wait and wait and wait for the grades and then woot, you did it! (5 Days)\\n\\n# Overall Thoughts\\n\\nI think this program is great, when I compare it to the program I did for my undergrad at a traditional university…it just cuts out so much red tape. I literally could not imagine having to go back to 3 classes a quarter, multiple lectures a week, and having to wait years to finish a degree. But there is a certain magic that you get through a traditional program too especially if you're young. You really just have to weigh out the pros and cons of each.\\n\\nI think the MBA program is especially useful for folks who don’t have an undergraduate degree in business. As I understand it, that is the original purpose of a master's degree - to learn something new, different from your undergrad education. This program gives you all the information of a business degree, without any fluff.\\n\\nI obviously have my undergrad degree in Business, but I was mainly looking to check a box for senior & teaching roles going into it. I did end up enjoying being able to apply my corporate experience to material that was familiar to me - I had a few ah-ha moments throughout the program. I think folks getting a BA in business from WGU (or any institution) and then immediately getting the MBA are doing themselves a disservice. Without time in between It really is just a summary of the BA program with a slight-managerial focus. If you’re just trying to check a box for whatever reason though, then more power to you.\\n\\nIf you want to branch out more for your next degree and have a business undergrad, I would wait until you have few years under your belt or get a master’s degree in a different or related field (MA or MS in IT or Marketing Analytics) these can offer certifications or hard skills that you can market to employers.\\n\\nThe MBA courses are all very manageable, the ones that took me the longest were C206, C212, and C207; those were purely due to fatigue & mental blocks. My favorite courses were C204 because I was able to apply a ton of my work experience to those assignments and C216 because I am a dork, and the simulation was really fun and truly a way to flex every concept you studied at once.\\n\\nOverall, I think programs like WGU are the future of education and would recommend this school to anyone, as long as you know what you are getting yourself into and think you can work through the program yourself - you can do it!  \n",



ever...\\nHi everyone,\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI just finished D287 and wanted to add some pointers for starting out before the project (just getting your bearings and learning the basics and stuff), as well as to try and clarify some things in the project instructions that I found to be not very clear. There are other guides that cover how to tackle each of the steps, so I don't go into that stuff. Instead, I just include some starting-out resources and then explain the parts I found to be ambiguous and try to give you some sense of what I think they might have meant.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDisclaimer: My brain picks apart the meaning of words without me even trying. I tend to think of all the ways an instruction (or OA test question...) might be interpreted and end up getting caught up trying to figure out exactly what they meant. So, it is possible that the things I found confusing about this PA were not that confusing to anyone else. But in case anyone else gets confused by imprecise wording, hopefully something here will help.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**BEGINNER STUFF BEFORE YOU DO THE PA THAT MIGHT HELP:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI had no idea what Spring was, or what a \"framework\" was, before this course. You'll see terms thrown around like \"dependency injection\" or \"inversion of control,\" but you don't really need to know the definition of those terms yet. You can just learn how Spring works and then later on, it will probably be easier to learn those terms because then you can say, oh, that's what this thing is called. Learning them first might just end up being confusing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy best beginner's explanation of Spring is this: there is a boatload of code that ends up being involved in doing something like making a functional website that links to a database and has info on stuff in your database and basically keeps your data secure and does everything else you need it to do. And a while ago, some people decided to basically write some generic code to do this stuff that you could just download and link to in your own code and it would do a lot of the work for you. (Sort of like if you end up writing the same email for a job or school once a week, you might end up copying and pasting the beginning of the email that stays the same every time, right? And you could save your stock email opening to a keyboard shortcut and then use that instead, and it would be less typing for you, yay!) But then over time, people got so happy at how much less work this was for them, that they kept adding more and more stuff. So then there was this awesome set of code you could customize and pick and choose bits from and use and it would make what once was a ton of work into a lot less work. But....because people have been adding to this thing for years and making it super functional and cool, it actually now has so much stuff that it can be overwhelming to learn all the things it can do.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nImagine if you had to go to the store and it was really far away and all you knew how to do was walk. But then someone was like \"oh here's this thing called a tricked-out SUV with awesome rims that shoots lasers at pedestrians,\" but you didn't know what any of those things were because all you knew was how to walk. So it would def get you to the store faster...but you'd still need to learn what a car was and what all those words meant and how to drive the car and operate the lasers and stereo (stereo? what's a stereo?) and all that jazz. So, in this example, Spring is the tricked-out SUV with awesome rims that shoots lasers at pedestrians, and you're the poor schlub who's out here trying to walk 27 miles to the store.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSoooo for the course material, I tried reading that book they link in the first chapter and it was super overwhelming. Ultimately, I tried a couple of courses on Udemy until found one I really liked: [\"Learn Spring Boot 3 in 100 Steps\"](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-tutorial-for-beginners/). It is available through your free WGU Udemy subscription ([https://wgu.udemy.com/](https://wgu.udemy.com/)). The reason I liked this course instead of some of the other ones is that it walks you through everything slowly and takes a one step at a time approach. Like, you start by making a Spring app that just....prints some text to a webpage locally on your computer, using Spring (so entirely through the backend with no html page). Then you do a tiny bit more, and then a tiny bit more, so that you're not overwhelmed with a barrage of info all at once. And also, there is a lot in here that relates to this project and also to the next project as well. (You end up creating some things that are the same kind of things as some of the stuff created for you in the project, which makes it easier to understand how to use those things, if that makes sense? Like you'll create a repository and a service, and both of those are in the project.) So if you're feeling a bit lost, def give this course a try. It really, really helped Spring feel less intimidating. One note: the project uses Thymeleaf and the course uses something called JSP files. I ended up doing my stuff in Thymeleaf and just googling \"Thymeleaf equivalent of JSP XYZ\" when needed. For example, for both, there is a specific place you need to put the files (aka you need to name your folder something specific and put it in a certain spot). The instructor will explain where the JSP place is and if you just google \"where do Thymeleaf files need to be in Spring,\" you'll find the equivalent place (or just look at the 287 project because it's the same).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlso, IMHO, there is one part of this course where you add Spring Security to your project that I felt explained the gist of Spring really well...basically you do very, very little and suddenly you have this at least semi-secure login page that blocks you from accessing any of the pages in the app until you enter the right id and password. You don't need to know this for the 287 project, it's just cool how little you have to do to get this thing working. It's like you download one thing and maybe write something up to store your username and password and bam, instant login. That is what made it really hit home for me what this whole Spring thing was about.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFor Java stuff, I don't know how much new stuff you really need to learn, but there's some in the book if you want. I tried reading the book but then I found this YouTube page, [Coding with John](https://www.youtube.com/@CodingWithJohn/videos?app=desktop), that has some good videos on specific Java concepts and is less boring than the book (the Java part of the book (chapters 2 onward) isn't terrible though or anything). The one on generics is pretty cool and is done well, and I ended up watching a bunch of other ones too (not necessary for the course but I wanted to learn it). The Hashset one is good and might be helpful for this project.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**STUFF IN THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT WAS CONFUSING THAT HOPEFULLY I CAN NOW CLARIFY:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe PA has you making a backend for the weirdest shop ever. Apparently, they want a webpage where customers can go and read about the products and buy the products, and also mess around with their internal inventory and product names and parts. So you could go visit this shop, buy something, then go in and edit the products to add a new product called \"a brand new, hot pink Maserati,\" and set the price at $1, and buy that, too. And then you could delete their entire inventory from their database just for fun. But hey, what the customer wants, the customer gets, right?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf you read the entire project first before starting anything, and are wondering where the \"update\" and \"delete\" buttons are, don't panic. They will only appear when there are products and parts in the tables.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFYI: IntelliJ will always find errors and warn you before pushing. I bet you could go in and add a single space to a single file and it would tell you that you had 14 errors and make you confirm again that you wanted to push. So don't sweat this. Also, if you amend your commit to include your own comment and delete IntelliJ's default commit message, for some reason it will just commit both. Like each commit of mine is one commit with my message and another with IntelliJ's stock message. My \"similarity score\" for my history file was like 80%, so I don't think I'm the only one who had a file full of the same default message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part B: how detailed does the README file have to be?**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI wondered if I was going to get dinged if I didn't detail every single possible change to every single line in excruciating detail, but practically speaking doing a literal line by line log seemed like a bit too much. I did write a lot, but I wrote most of my changes in groups. I would group the lines related to the change, like if I wrote a method in a class, I'd just put lines 25-30 for the method. I did have a LOT of style changes to the HTML files and I broke those down in a bit more detail, but still grouped them by category (like \"changed layout of main page using CSS grid and moved these two sections next to each other\"). I just sort of used my judgment and tried to balance meeting the requirement of detailing changes by line with not making the evaluator's eyes bleed.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I would go back during later steps and change things again that were technically part of earlier steps, I did put those changes in the readme under the earlier step, but I just said \"went back during a later step and changed the background,\" etc. (As you can see, I can write a lot, so I was not too worried about being dinged for not writing enough. Mostly I just tried to keep everything brief but make sure I included enough chunks with detailed changes to show I was being diligent. Some parts were much more detailed than others.)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDid you know...? IntelliJ will highlight files with changes in them before a commit, and inside the file it will mark the changed lines on one side. So if you see a highlighted file but don't want to commit any changes to that file (maybe you added a line of whitespace or something), go back into that file and hit CTRL Z to undo changes until the file name isn't highlighted anymore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part C: the HTML interface**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI like messing with webpage style so I took this literally and went to town. But, as instructed, I did not delete a single element. I commented out the bootstrap link (hey, it's not an \"element,\" so bye bye bootstrap), but otherwise left all of their actual elements on the page. I just created my own divs and classes around them. I also changed some of the bootstrap classes they had put in their elements to my own class names. I did move the layout of the products and parts tables to be next to each other instead of stacked, centered everything, etc., and it was all fine. You don't have to do this, I just did it because I find that stuff fun.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe instructions say that the page should include the product names and parts....does adding them to the tables count? Because then they're in the tables and displayed on the page...but it said to \"add the names to the page,\" not add the products to the table. I originally just added them to the table and thought that was fine because the page was already cluttered enough. The instructor demo project (if you notice) only has them in the table and does not have them listed separately, so it's probably fine. However, if you delete your products and parts entirely, then the product names and part names aren't there anymore, so I ended up going back later on and adding the product and part names to the top on either side of the shop name just to be safe.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBUT.....the document they give you with the task says something about Outsourced Parts and Inhouse Parts...do you have to indicate which is which on the page? There will be more on this later but for Part C, you can just put the name of the part without regard for outsourced or inhouse anything.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part D: How much is required?**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis one is pretty self explanatory. The instructor demo version has a single line of text but I actually think they want a little more than that. I had fun and made a whole silly page with a little story and all, but I think you just have to have something describing your company. In my evaluation report there was a line that said something like \"the About page describes the company,\" so might as well throw a few lines in there just saying what the company sells and all.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part E: Why doesn't it tell you how many parts have to be outsourced/inhouse???**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis step is not that clear. You're supposed to add five products and five parts, but it says nothing about outsourced or inhouse parts. Does it mean five outsourced *and* five inhouse? Five total from one or the other, or a combination of both? I ended up making 3 of one kind and 2 of another, and I passed, but I have no idea what they actually want here. I think if you at least have one of each and five total, you're probably fine. I have no idea if you can do more than 5. As far as this whole \"don't overwrite existing data in the database\" thing, I don't know what that means because later in the same step, it says you're only supposed to add your sample inventory when \\*both\\* the product and part tables are empty. AKA only when there are no products and no parts in inventory. So what would you be writing over? I assume this is just some kind of redundancy meant to enforce the rule about only putting products and parts in when everything is empty, idk. I assume if you just follow this step like the other guides have spelled out, it should be fine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nRegarding the \"multi-pack\" thing...basically your products have to be made up of your parts (don't over think this, it's fine if you had like a bicycle and your parts were wheels and a seat...obviously a bike has more than that in it). And if you want one product, their app is not set up to let you add multiple copies of a part to a product (you can \"associate\" parts to products using their product form). So instead, if your product needs two wheels, just make the wheel part be \"set of two wheels.\" If you also sell a unicycle, then they just get an extra wheel as a spare.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part F: The buy now message**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe one thing I'll touch on here is that message indicating success or failure. What kind of message? Do they want a pop up? A message on the page itself? A separate page? I don't know. What I do know is that for their own \"delete part\" confirmation message, they made a separate page that it will divert you to after you delete a part. You can view the html file for this page in the project. They also made their page immediately go back to the main page with no delay, so when you delete a product it's kind of a blink-and-you'll-miss-it message. So....if that's sufficient for the delete part, then it should be sufficient for the buy now message. So I made two separate HTMLs, one for success and one for failure, and just routed to either of those after the buynow was clicked. I did go and look up some simple javascript to set a brief delay before going back to the other page instead of the instantaneous reroute so you could actually read the message, but I don't think that was necessary. And that part passed so I imagine just using the same thing they did would work as well. You could probably pass by displaying the message another way if you feel comfortable with that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs far as that little line about not decreasing the inventory of the associated parts....what? Notice they never told you that your sample inventory needed to have parts associated with it...there is a way to do that via their web forms but what if your sample inventory is populated from the command line runner? Do you need to find a way to associate parts to products then? I do not know if you do, but I went ahead and did this. The only thing I would note is that the id I set for my parts and products would be overwritten when the parts and products were saved to the repository (not when creating them, only when using [repository.save](https://repository.save)(product/part). If you look at part and product, you'll see a \"generated value\" annotation on the id field, and I think what that does is, when the product/part is actually saved to the database, it auto generates an id. So then if you try to find by id after saving to the repository, the id might not be the same (at least, it wasn't for me). I don't even know if this is required, but I ended up writing some long code that broke this down into steps, so that I would first save all my products and parts, then access the repository and do a for loop checking if the product/part name .equals() and then getting the id for each product/part that way, and then going back and adding a set of parts to each product and products to each part, and resaving all to the repo.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis was not super difficult, but it was long. There is probably a much easier and shorter way to do it, but at that point I just wanted to not have any more errors pop in so I did it the long way. I have not seen this in other guides so I don't know if it's necessary at all to even do this. But, when I was done and deleted everything from the website in order to make the sample inventory populate, it did populate with the associated parts. And then....turns out I didn't have to do anything to make sure the buy now button didn't decrement the associated parts because why would it? Their code is written to decrement parts when adding more of a product, not when removing a product (like when buying it).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOne thing to note: to test out the code I did end up deleting everything and having it repopulate many times while working on the project. (They will test your code with nothing in the database to make sure your sample inventory populates when evaluating it.) So, I would test the functions with everything there and then delete it all, rerun the program and see how it acted when repopulating everything over and over again. So, even if you're not required to put the associated parts with the products in the sample inventory, it did make it easier than having to go through and re add them each time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Parts G and H: how many ways can you validate the same thing?**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe last line of G seems like it's part of the same thing as Part H. You're \"enforcing\" your new fields within the code and then also validating them? What? Isn't the code already validated by virtue of it being enforced? Like if the person can't add inventory outside of the min max range, then they can't add it. This is confusing. I think what they want by \"enforcement\" is the code not allowing a person to add inventory outside the range, and by \"validation\" is to basically do something that enforces it again but also displays a message. I couldn't figure out if the message had to be done using a validator, or if using Thymeleaf (you can use an if statement in Thymeleaf to display a message if a condition is met) was fine. I did it through Thymeleaf first and later got worried that by \"validation\" they might have meant \"write a class for a Validator,\" so I did both.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Part J: what are you actually supposed to delete?**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is explained in another post, but one thing I didn't know was whether they wanted the class file only deleted or the class file + the corresponding interface (each validator has two files). After all, an interface is still a class file...but then again, the interface had some \"usages\" marked in IntelliJ, so that would mean having to go through and delete those usages, but it didn't say to delete those....so I just deleted the one file and left it's lonely little interface there and apparently that was fine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHopefully this is helpful...if anyone else is stuck on some instruction that seems confusing or ambiguous, I can try to help. I am sure there were a lot more things that I forgot to include that I found confusing about this project.  \n",

Full guide inside.\\n*(EDIT: Some typo fixes and minor revisions.)* I'm DONE! I Just finished up my BSCS in one term while working full-time. I owe a ton of thanks to this community for providing assistance at various points, so this is my attempt to give back by writing a comprehensive guide to what I did. \\n\\n**TLDR:**\\n\\n1. 1 month planning/prep, 2-3 months of Sophia, 1-2 month study.com (SDC), 1 month prep, than 6 months WGU.\\n2. Prep = pre-study Java, Discrete Math, Linux, Networking/Security, maybe Version Control before starting to maximize your paid time.\\n3. Once enrolled at WGU, Get with your mentor ASAP about your plans to accelerate; you don't want to waste study time waiting on them to add more courses to your plan.\\n4. For project classes, submit tasks at 70% quality level and let evaluators guide you on what to improve (submit early, submit often!) Usually, it's best to  go straight to the tasks, referring back to the course material or Google if you have questions.\\n5. For test classes, take PA FIRST (don't look at/write down answers, just focus on question format and overall strong/weak points) then focus your studying around understanding PA questions, then retake the PA. Answers are a trap; don't look at them. 80% PA level is probably good enough.\\n6. Don't sweat the details too much. The order you take classes at WGU, which classes to take at SDC, what % you need on OA's before taking a PA...not that big a deal. As long as you are consistently working tasks or studying for OA's daily, you're fine.\\n\\n**Background:**\\n\\nI think it's important you know my background, so you can see if this plan works for you. I'm an IT manager in my late 30's who's been working in government IT jobs for a decade+. I was able to fly through the IT portions of the degree and/or get transfer credit, but felt reasonably challenged by the CS portions that were new and wholly unfamiliar. Calibrate accordingly.\\n\\n**Why you should NOT accelerate:**\\n\\n* First, understand what you are sacrificing if you plan to complete in one term. While WGU has much less \"fluff\" compared to a more traditional online degree, it's still a lot of work. You will have to be very focused and that's not very fun when you really want to do stuff with your kids, or just binge watch Succession, etc. Burnout is real, and there were days I definitely regretted doing this.\\n* Second, let's be real - if you do this, you're not going to remember most of it. That said, I took four years to get my bachelor's (in a non-technical field), and I don't remember most of that, either. If you're expecting to actually learn CS to anything more than basic familiarity, that's going to take either work experience or additional self-study above and beyond WGU's materials. My personal opinion is 1 year accelerated WGU + 3 years of Leetcode/projects/interviewing/etc. will prep you for a CS job WAY better than 4 years of traditional CS schooling, but I think reasonable people can disagree on this point.\\n\\nWith that, let's get to the guide.\\n\\n**General Tips:**\\n\\nFor every course, follow these steps.\\n\\n1. Search Reddit for the specific course number; someone has likely written up a guide.\\n2. Click through the \"Course Tips\" and \"Course Search\" on the right hand side of the Course Page, and read things linked there- there's usually something helpful posted there that isn't officially posted in the announcements. \"Course Chatter\" can also have some gems occasionally.\\n3. Join the relevant channel on the WGU CS Discord and look for any pinned posts or guides that people have linked.\\n4. For OA courses, take the PA FIRST as a pre-test, as there's nothing worse than studying the textbook for a couple weeks and realizing that it's not relevant or way too in-depth, etc. DON\"T look at the answers when complete; just get a feel for the questions and what you're expected to know. Once you do that, THEN go study with that in mind. (I prefer reading textbooks to Youtube videos, but there are plenty of video alternatives out there for all this stuff if you'd rather. Keep in mind that you have to actually pay attention to the video and not just have it in the background while you focus on finding lethal in Hearthstone.) When you think you've got it, take the PA again, This time, you can look at the answers, but look at ALL of them. The important thing is the process; if you guessed and got it right, that's bad from a PA perspective, so review anything that you didn't know cold. Repeat until you're about 80% confident, then take the OA. (100% confidence will take time you don't have.) \\n5. For task-based courses, start with the actual tasks. (I found it helpful to print out the Task Overview so I could have it nearby when studying - you want to make sure you're studying something that's actually a task.) When doing the tasks, you want to follow the requirements outline EXACTLY; it's super boring and repetitive, but each requirement section gets evaluated independently so you want to make it easy to the evaluator to check the box and move on. Finally, a lot of the requirements are vague. It's tempting to add dozens of extra pages of detail to cover every contingency, or ask the CI's to clarify (they won't); fight that temptation, just give it your best guess and submit. Either you're right, or you're you can adjust based on the evaluator's feedback. You have unlimited submissions! Use them. I would say about 50% of my tasks were first-time completes, and 95% were completed after one revision. (Note that some evaluators will force you to talk to a CI before resubmitting; this happened to me twice, and both times a quick email to the CI unlocked it within a day.)\\n\\n**Month 1 - Prep**\\n\\nPlan, plan, plan. Write out a list of all the courses in the major and how you plan to get credit for them. (This list is a good [starting point.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/12xwwnc/updated_bscs_curriculum_and_credit_transfer_from/)) I had a spreadsheet listing each course and my plan for getting credit for it.\\n\\nOnce you have a plan, start talking to WGU about a projected start date. You can change it up until you finish Orientation, so feel free to push it back if life happens. Get an initial transfer eval (if you have prior college or certs to transfer in). Do this ASAP - you want to know early what you got credit for and what you didn't to plan what things you need to take/not take.\\n\\nPre-Study: This is critical to the plan. I recommend pre-studying the following topics when time allows before committing to WGU.\\n\\n* Java: I used the [r/learnjava](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/) recommended [Java Programming course](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) from the University of Helsinki. Try to do a little each day; there's a lot of exercises, but you need the practice for it to become second nature.\\n* Discrete Math: I used this [free Discrete Math textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/) from Oscar Levin.\\n* Linux: The Linux Foundations textbook [is freely available](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/010-160/) and is the same material used on the test.\\n* Networking/Security: I didn't need this given my background, but if you do [Professor Messer](https://www.professormesser.com/) has some great free resources.\\n* Version Control: Tons of free resources one Google away, but GitHub's [official tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git) is quick and all you need.\\n\\n**Month 2-3 - Sophia**\\n\\n[Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) (non-referral link) is great, and where you want to take the vast majority of your transfer courses. It has three key redeeming features. First, it's cheap at $100/month. Second, the tests are open-book. Third, it's a good barometer. If you can knock out the Sophia courses in 1-2 months, then you have the ability to successfully complete the accelerated schedule. If not, then you  need to allow yourself more time (which is something you want to know early before you start spending the bigger $).\\n\\n*How to Sophia:*\\n\\nThe [Student Guide](https://www.sophia.org/content/dam/sophia/sophia-guide-and-syllabus/sophia-student-guide.pdf) sums it up well, but each course is a mix of Challenges, Milestones, and Touchstones. Challenges are 3-5 question multiple-choice quizzes, with two attempts at each question; these are straightforward. Milestones are longer timed tests. For these, I recommend having the practice Milestone and the course open in separate tabs; this is explicitly allowed, and makes it much easier to reference formulas or methods for solving problems. Touchstones are projects, and vary in difficulty.\\n\\nKey point to remember is that you can only have two classes open at a time, so ideally you want to start a class, do all the Challenges and Milestones, submit all the Touchstones, then start on your second class while the first Touchstones are being graded. (If you're super fast and have two classes blocked and waiting on Touchstones, supposedly chat support will open a third class for you.)\\n\\nI can't speak to the general education classes as I had transfer credit for those, but for the rest:\\n\\n* Intro to IT / Intro to Web Dev - two very simple and straightforward courses that should take no more than a day each.\\n* Intro to Python Programming / Intro to Java Programming - while I don't think these courses are very good at teaching Java or Python, they're a much easier way to get credit than the respective WGU course. If you've taken a programming course before (or the Helsinki course), these will be easy. I recommend taking both as you'll need to know some Python for WGU DSA2, and you MAY (not guaranteed) get credit for both SP - Foundations and SP - Applications. You really want credit for both as Applications is pretty tough at WGU.\\n* Intro to Relational Databases - this course is pretty long and dry, but a decent primer for SQL and a good measure of difficulty. You can Google-force your way through the other courses, but not so much this one. Keep in mind there's no project for this one so I'd work on it while waiting for your Java or Python project to be graded.\\n* Calculus - The \"toughest,\" though not that tough if all you care about is passing. The instruction isn't the greatest so use Khan Academy or similar sources if you're stuck on how to solve things.\\n\\n**Month 4-5 - Study.com** (SDC)\\n\\nSDC is overrated, IMO. It's Sophia with maybe slightly better course quality, a much worse interface, and 2-3x the cost/time due to a frankly insane number of quizzes that are all mandatory. (For comparison's sake: Sophia Calculus has 105 quiz questions, broken into 21 quizzes, and 130 test questions broken into six tests. SDC Calculus has over 500 quiz questions, plus a 50 question test.)\\n\\nWhy are we here? There's a few WGU courses that can ONLY be done at SDC, and SDC courses are easier than WGU courses to pass as the quizzes count toward your final grade.\\n\\n*How to SDC:*\\n\\n1. Once you've signed up for a class, take the \"placement test\" first. This will give you credit for some of the quizzes. You can retake the placement test and get a little more credit for missed questions.\\n2. For each \"section,\" open the quiz in one tab and keep the material open in the other. If you don't 100% a quiz, retake it in another tab so you can refer back to the correct/incorrect answers. (Some people do the quizzes on their phone.)\\n3. Once done with all the quizzes, do the (typically simple) project if the course has one, take a practice exam, then schedule the \"proctored\" exam.\\n4. Note that it can take a week or more for exams/projects to be graded, so you want to be completely done with SDC by the middle of month 5, to allow them to get you the grades back in time to submit to WGU.\\n\\n*What to take at SDC:*\\n\\n* Data Management - Applications / Advanced Data Management: These two courses on SDC have overlapping quizzes, so that relieves some of the tedium, and the equivalent WGU courses are somewhat challenging. (This assumes you took Intro to Relational Databases at Sophia; if not you'll want to also take the Data Management - Foundations at SDC.)\\n* Discrete Math 1: Either way, this is tough to learn, but the SDC test is significantly easier. (I took it at WGU, which I regret as the Zybook wasn't very good and I ended up using outside materials.)\\n* Data Structures and Algorithms I: Like DM1, the DSA1 test is easier. You definitely want to have the Java prep done before you do this.\\n\\n*What to not take at SDC:*\\n\\n* Artificial Intelligence: People say take AI at SDC due to the AI course at WGU having a monster third project - what they're missing is that you can use the monster third project as your capstone project also, with a little extra work.\\n* Computer Architecture: The WGU CA exam is pretty difficult, but the projects at SDC are VERY time-consuming. Plus, the WGU CA material duplicates over to Operating Systems.\\n* Fundamentals of Information Security: I had credit for this so didn't take it at WGU, but from a glance through the curriculum it looks VERY similar to D315.\\n* Anything you can take at Sophia, obvs.\\n\\n**Month 6 - Final Prep**\\n\\n* Make SURE your final transfer credit eval is right; once you start you can't go back.\\n* Keep doing Prep. If you have extra time, look at MIT's \"[Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)\"; some quick lectures on a lot of beginner-level topics that CS courses don't teach well.\\n\\n**Month 7-12: WGU**\\n\\nIt's go time! I've grouped courses into a rough recommended order and time recommendations, but there's no hard prerequisites so don't freak out if your mentor wants to do something different. Get on their good side, btw; typically mentors are going to be resistant to acceleration plans until you demonstrate you can knock our the first set of classes, so don't push it too hard.\\n\\nEdit: [u/katrinars\\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/katrinars_/) has a ton of great walkthroughs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT2YfYBaoU9Jxh0hj9ytbYvGUL7FAWN7wzyWOk6JCsErmGib4_qbBkEhz1sE-_Bqx1e1v349GOx41DA/pub), highly recommended and I wish I had known about these when I was doing the classes.\\n\\nIT Classes (4 weeks):\\n\\n* D197 Version Control - Simple and quick, but vital to know for future projects. Knocking this out <1 week will help your mentor know you're serious about accelerating.\\n* D281 Linux Foundations -If you pre-studied, this can be a week 1 completion; if not, can be done in a week.\\n* D315 Network and Security Foundations - it's tough for me to assess the difficulty of this class since this is what I do in my day job (WGU wouldn't take my certs because they were over 5 years old...even though I have to pay an AMF and do CE's...grumble). This will probably take 1-2 weeks of study if you have no familiarity with IT and didn't do the prep. If you need D430 (Fundamentals of Information Security), take it right after D315 as the material is very similar.\\n* D336 Business of IT - Ugh, this class sucks. The material is mind-numbing memorization, but thankfully there's not that much of it. The worst part is the Axelos software you have to install for the test is some of the shittiest software I've ever seen. I think I spent more time trying to get the test software working than I did actually studying the material. Give yourself PLENTY of time on test day for this one.\\n\\nMath Classes (4 weeks):\\n\\n* C960 Discrete Mathematics 2: There's not a lot of guiding I can do here, unfortunately; you really have to read the textbook and learn how to do the problems. Hopefully you did DM1 at SDC, which is much easier. I didn't and ended up taking six weeks total for both, including a \"fresh start\" where I dug up the other Discrete Math book linked above that helped me finally \"get it.\"  You can supplement with [Youtube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxersk8fUxiUMSIx0DBqsKZS) if that helps, too.\\n\\nCoding Classes (6 weeks):\\n\\n* D286 Java Fundamentals - If you did the Java prep course, this will be a snap - you can skip right to the PA. Note that this PA/OA is different than the others as it's the only one to have an actual coding environment; as such, you'll want to take this PA several times, each time focusing on a few of the coding questions, to make sure you're comfortable coding in the given environment.\\n* D287 Java Frameworks - This course is where things get real. Forget most of the Java you just learned; this is actually a frameworks/design patterns/MVC course. That's a good idea, but the curriculum is basically \"go watch this Udemy video,\" so I bounced off it and tried to just Google my way through the tasks. This is a BAD idea because there are tons of fiddly little bits between your IDE, Maven, Spring Boot, and Java that all have to be in sync for things to work right, and Googling isn't going to help you understand which specific fiddly bit is wrong. Take some time here and build a Spring Boot-powered website from scratch so you understand what the annotations are actually doing.\\n* D288 Back-End Programming - All the fiddly bits of D287, but now \"do it in a virtual environment for no real good reason,\" and \"let's add SQL and Angular fiddly bits on top of the existing fiddly bits.\" This is where tiny mistakes will sink you for days so triple-check spellings on things.\\n* D387 Advanced Java - If you made it through D287/D288, this is pretty easy in comparison. The \"advanced\" stuff you have to learn here isn't really all that advanced, and the tasks are much more straightforward compared to the other two classes.\\n\\nDesign and Theory Classes (6 weeks)\\n\\n* D284/D480 Software Engineering/ Software Design+QA - If you need a break from coding, you'll get it here. These two classes are all writing assignments where you get to take some information about requirements and then design or engineer a solution. The Design one is faintly ridiculous as you have to create two multi-page documents to explain what is effectively a one-line code fix, so put on your pretend bureaucrat hat.\\n* C952 Computer Architecture - This class gets some hate, which I don't understand. It's definitely a lot of vocab, but this is all pretty key stuff. Overall this felt similar in quality to other college-level Computer Arch courses. Use the Lusby webinars as a guide to what to focus your reading on.\\n* C151 Operating Systems - Not as \"high-level abstract\" as Computer Architecture, but not very low-level either, so in-between? Anyway, I breezed through this class, but my IT background definitely helped me here. It relooks a lot of material from Computer Arch so definitely take that first.\\n\\nAlgorithms/AI/Capstone (4 weeks)\\n\\n* C950 Data Structures and Algorithms 2 - like many of the WGU courses, this class isn't really about algorithms and is really a \"mini-capstone coding project\" in disguise. The \"program a hash table from scratch\" part of the task is very straightforward and will take a couple lines of code; the \"use it to deliver all these packages\" will take many more lines and will stretch your coding ability.\\n* C951/C964 Artificial Intelligence / Capstone - The \"AI\" course is really just a grab bag of stuff. Two tasks are pretty easy; the first has you writing some basic scripting code for a chatbot, and the second has you tweaking some existing computer vision code (follow the Course Tips!). The third task of AI is to design an ML project. If you peek ahead to the Capstone, you'll see that the task there is to execute an ML project, so you can absolutely use one project to accomplish both tasks.\\n\\nThat's it!



(Acceleration Guide)\\nThis post is about my experience in WGU’s MBA program. I completed the program in 42 days, starting on December 1st, 2021. I’ve modeled this post on two other posts that helped me immensely, and I probably wouldn’t have been able to accelerate this much if it wasn’t for them, so please show them love. \\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/ot0usb/wgu\\_mba\\_the\\_sort\\_of\\_accelerated\\_adventure/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/ot0usb/wgu_mba_the_sort_of_accelerated_adventure/)\\n\\nAbout me: I completed my BSBA from WGU in 4.5 months last year, so I am no stranger to accelerating. The format for the MBA program is almost 100% similar, but the expectations and workload are higher. During this time, I technically worked full time, but I used a TON of vacation days so that I could focus on school. I only worked 2 days a week for 5 weeks and concentrated 100% on school in between holiday events and family/social obligations. I also started to feel sick during the capstone (unbeknownst to me at the time it was covid setting in) but I managed to complete everything. When I started this program, I wanted to complete it by the semester end date, but then I saw that there would be a physical commencement in my city in a few months, but I had to be done sooner than the semester end date. This gave me a deadline of 4 months, and when I started, I allocated myself 10 days per class to meet this deadline. \\n\\nSome quick tips:\\n\\n1. Prepare for your upcoming class. Read about it on reddit, get other’s opinions on it. Know what is necessary to complete and what isn’t. A lot of classes have a lot of supplemental material, if you want to read it all go ahead. I wanted to focus on course specific material and meet my deadline. If you’re looking to accelerate, then it doesn’t help you to go into classes blind. You might find that you may be able to test out of certain classes early due to work experience or be pointed in a direction with more helpful resources.  \\n\\n2. STICK.TO.THE.RUBRIC. Enough said. This applies to ALL WGU classes with papers. Ignore paper length recommendations. Answer the prompt and move on. You’re not getting bonus points for writing books. Speaking of papers, the MBA program provides you a really good business paper template early on. SAVE THIS TEMPLATE. I used this template for ALL my papers. I will probably use it in my career for professional reports. IT IS THAT GOOD. Learn how to use Word’s “Manage Sources” feature in the References menu. This makes citing sources a breeze (I started using this in my BSBA). \\n\\n3. Get a business calculator. I used the TI BAII Plus. LEARN THE CALCULATOR. When I started this, I was under the assumption that there would be minimal math like in the BSBA. I was wrong. There is a class that you will be miserable in if you do not learn the business calculator. You may be able to get by with a regular calculator, but I honestly don’t see how unless you’re some sort of math genius. That class is hard enough, you don’t need to add stress to it by trying to figure out calculator work arounds. The calculator is about $30 USD. Just spend the money. You’re working on an MBA; you’ll see the return on investment. \\n\\n4. Check the course resources. A lot of classes have really good instructor provided resources and videos. If you’re stuck, look here. I found myself just jumping there upon starting a class, before even reading the material. Some of these resources are more helpful than the textbook. \\n\\nThe classes are listed in the order I took them:\\n\\n**C200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People** – Pretty easy, sort of tedious. Wow, 2 papers right off the bat. Ok then. So, there was not much reading material in this class, you literally jump in and start writing. If you’re a recent graduate this will be easy, just a warmup. If it’s been a while you may have to shake the dust off. In the first task you complete a leadership evaluation. Takes about 30 minutes. Then you write a paper about your personal leadership style. In the second task you evaluate someone else’s leadership style. I submitted 2 11-page papers. Both passed first attempt. Took about 3-4 days total. \\n\\n**C202 – Managing Human Capital** – This was pretty easy. If you’re returning from WGU’s business school like I did, or work in a professional environment this should be common sense. A lot of the material is reused from the undergrad courses. I took the time to read through the 14 chapters just because I’m paranoid when it comes to multiple choice tests. I wanted to make sure I understood the terminology that would be used. Maybe this was overkill, I scored all blue bars on the assessment. This covers staffing, recruitment, retention, risk management, training and development, performance management, compensation strategies, employee benefits, and unions. Took about 2-3 days.  \\n\\n**C204 – Management Communication** – Easy, somewhat tedious. Another writing class. This was an easy class, I just found it tedious due to having to be creative. Task 1 has you writing emails, blogs, letters, and addressing customer complaints. Easy stuff but you have to imagine yourself in the role of the scenario. I do this all day long at work so it wasn’t new to me. Then you write a short paper about why you used the communication methods you used for each document. Task 2 is a PowerPoint presentation and Panopto recording. I found this easier and more enjoyable than task 1. This is exactly the same as the Panopto projects in the undergrad programs. Took about 2-3 days. \\n\\n**C212 – Marketing** – Easy but tedious, 1 long paper. I didn’t bother reading any of the material. I jumped straight into the task. You write a paper from the perspective of a company that is proposing new products or services. Just follow the rubric as you write your paper. The hardest part is coming up with the product or service, as this has to be based in reality and must be feasible. My advice, just write what you know. What services or products do you use often, and what changes would you make for that company if you could? That’s how I approached it. Then I researched what I needed and wrote it up. This class has a good task template. I used it as a rough draft, and research what I needed on another window. It also points you to sections of the textbook you’ll need to cite. I had to submit this 10-page paper twice due to missing a rubric prompt. Oops. Took about 3-4 days, but 7 days total waiting for the resubmission to clear. I had already started the next class in the meantime. \\n\\n**C213 Accounting for Decision Makers** – Medium difficulty. This class re-uses a lot of material from the undergrad course, so if you’re still fresh from that then this will be easy. There is some math in this but nothing crazy. Just basic calculations. The trick is knowing what the word problem is asking, then running the math. Study the concepts and learn how to read the basic financial statements. *I recommend you really learn this, as this will be important later.* There’s only 11 chapters in this so its easy to pick up on the main concepts and terminology. Took about 2-3 days, I finished this class while waiting for my C212 results to post. \\n\\n\\*\\*Now, I’m not sure how your degree plan is structured, but I recommend that you take C213 and C214 back-to-back. Do whatever it takes to have these classes assigned together. Beg, plead, offer your first-born, bribe (just kidding!), whatever it takes. C214 builds directly on C213 and it will make a night and day difference if you stack these. \\*\\*\\n\\n**C214 – Financial Management** – Ok, probably the first challenging class of the program, and we’re already halfway there. First thing, LEARN THE CALCULATOR. There is a video in the resources that walks you through the functions. Or look up other videos or resources but do something! Learn what all those white function buttons are for. There is a lot of math in this class! And this is one of those classes where the OA seems to not align 100% with the material or PA, so you will already be going in at a disadvantage. You can’t afford to miss easy math questions because you didn’t know how to program the calculator. All the formulas will be provided during the OA. My advice? Skim through the textbook and take quick notes. The material is really dry, but just push through, even if you’re not getting it. Just keeping reading and keep taking quick notes. There is formula after formula and example after example. Focus on concepts and terms. When you get to government regulations, REALLY study that page and how the laws apply to different sectors. Then watch the instructor videos. All 4 of them. Its about 9 hours’ worth of footage. Watch it on 1.5 or 2x speed. Get some coffee and some popcorn. (I had a vape pen and energy drink handy) As you start to go through the videos all the notes you took will ‘click’. Dr. H’s 3-part video series really explains the concepts in the course better than the textbook does. Dr. V’s bootcamp video does an excellent job in showing you how to decode the word problems and step by step calculator instructions for each one. This took me about 3 days but let me tell you it did feel like a “bootcamp” (I would know 😉). Even after all this I scored 4 blue bars and 3 green bars. I would have struggled more if it hadn’t been for the videos. \\n\\n**C211 – Global Economics for Managers** – Medium. After the back-to-back math classes I asked for this class. It was a refreshing change from all the equations. Pretty straightforward, read the textbook, learn the concepts and keywords, and study for the PA/OA. I’d say that if you’re at this level of education, you’re probably already familiar with the concepts in this class. I do not work in the financial sector in any capacity, but I still knew about FOREX concepts and stuff. Some of this might have been covered in the undergrad program. I used quizlet flashcards to supplement learning. This class took about 2 days. I did bomb one of the competencies in the test somehow (but my PA scores were all high?), but still made up for it in other areas. Who knows, a pass is a pass, might’ve still been brain fried from the math class, and the holidays were right around the corner. Whatever the case, I’ll take the 2-day pass!\\n\\n**C215 – Operations Management** – Medium/Hard. A lot of these concepts were common sense and covered in the undergrad program. Nothing new here. What’s hard is picking out the information you’ll need for the PA/OA. The way the questions are worded is tricky also. It’s one thing to understand the concept, and it’s another when you get a question that wants a very specific and technical answer. There was a lot of multiple answer questions in this, and you need to know all the aspects of what it asks. As you know from these types of tests, if you don’t select the exact 4 answers for example, you’ll get the whole question wrong. My results for this where all over the place. 2 blues, 2 greens, and 2 oranges. But I passed this class in 2 days! And I was in a rush since this was 12/24 and I had somewhere out of town I needed to be for the holidays, so I sprinted through this class. \\n\\n**C206 – Ethical Leadership** – Another easy but tedious paper class. You have to write 3 papers for this class. You should have a solid system by now when it comes to writing papers, just stick to it. I wrote a 9-, 8-, and 9-page paper, all passed first try. Took me about 4-5 days to write all these papers. Just take your time, break it up into chunks, take breaks. It might be worth taking this class early on just to get these papers out of the way. \\n\\n**C207 – Data-Driven Decision Making** – Well here it is, the world famous C207 class. The class everyone hates. The class everyone struggles with. The last class between you and the capstone. This class is easily the hardest class I’ve taken at WGU. But my opinion? It’s hard because the material isn’t very helpful, and the tasks aren’t very clear. I don’t have a statistics background, so a textbook that skims the subject doesn’t help me. And while one chapter is skimming the surface of what you need to know, the next is a deep dive into calculations I’ve never seen, understand, or have a frame of reference for. The order in which the tasks need to be submitted is another thing that gave me issues. This class has you submit task 1 before you even start to understand the material. You have to submit a business hypothesis that can be evaluated with real-world statistics. What kind of statistical evaluation methods? Who knows?! Because you haven’t understood the material yet. Everyone recommends the T-test, I do too. It is the easiest of all methods. And remember, you need 30 data points! So, whatever you’re trying to measure better have 30 sources of public data available. Or you could collect your own data, but now you’ll need to submit release forms as well with your task. Performing the calculation was the easiest part of this, explaining it via a report in task 2 was not. Task 2 needs to be answered a *very specific* way or it will be returned. I honestly thought my initial premise was flawed after I finished going through the class and was ready to work on task 2. But you have to stick to your original task 1 premise for task 2. My initial report was returned with “it is unclear whether the results are related to an analysis technique that is appropriate for the business situation”. I reached out to the course instructor who pointed me in the right direction, and after some changes to my report it passed. Perhaps this class should have you complete the material and OA before you submit a real-life scenario and analysis. Its not fun stumbling in the dark because you don’t really understand this stuff yet. To give credit where its due, there are a TON of resources for this class. It’s like everyone knows this class is very confusing, so there are PowerPoints, video presentations, printouts, all sorts of stuff for this class. I felt like I had to have someone hold my hand literally every step of these tasks. For the OA I used quizlet in learning mode to really nail the concepts and scored exemplary. Took me 6 days for this class, including the time lost to resubmitting task 2. This also occurred during New Year’s weekend, so I had other stuff going on as well. For anyone about to take this class: take a deep breath, take it slow, don’t be afraid to ask for help, reach out to your mentors or instructors, and download all the resources you’ll need. This class is the worst! But it’s a shame because it doesn’t have to be; when all said and done its not that complex, its just so poorly structured. \\n\\n**C216 – MBA Capstone –** Finally! If you’re coming from C207 like I did then this will be super easy compared to that! The capstone is a business simulation where you manage a company quarter to quarter. It is VERY similar to the simulation mid-capstone in the undergrad program. For many of you this may be the second time taking this simulation, the only difference here are the reporting requirements are more in-depth. I actually found this very fun, this is something I’d do in my free time to relax, but I like playing strategy games so to each their own. Work through your first 4 quarters, then you pause and submit a Panopto presentation to seek more capital. This will be about a 20-minute presentation, but if you follow the rubric, you’ll have enough material to present. Protip: Do not submit Q4 until you submit your presentation. You will also need to complete your tactical plan for Q5 and Q6, and if you submit Q4 before you do this, it will “lock”. Then you’ll have to do it by hand, and it WILL BE TEDIOUS. We’re talking manually editing income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, plus a LOT more for 2 quarters. Let the program do it for you, then just export it and attach it to your presentation. Once that’s approved, you’ll be allowed to complete quarters 5 and 6. Now you write a report about your company’s performance. *Remember in C213 when you really learned the financial statements? Now is the time to use that knowledge, cite your statements accordingly as you work through the report.* Answer the rubric prompts, pretty straightforward. You made all the decisions, so you know why you did what you did and what effect it had, just put it on paper. Protip: keep notes each quarter of any changes you’re making and why as you’re going through the simulation. My final report was 17 pages, but there were a lot of graphs and charts. Task 3 is honestly the easiest task in the whole program. It’s a period of reflection, you write about what you learned, how it helped you, and how it will help you in the future. Then you update your resume, linkedin profile, and upload some artifacts. What kind of artifacts? Its up to you. I used my BSBA and a couple of certifications from work. \\n\\nAnd now you’re done! Just wait to receive an email asking you to complete your graduation application (I got mine this morning!). If you have the WGU app, wait until you get the owl banner and screenshot it (I can’t wait to add mine to my previous banner screenshot). This is a solid program, and even if you don’t accelerate to this pace, it is easily doable in 1 term. All you have to do is maintain a 2 week per class pace, and that’s not too rough. \\n\\nWhat’s next? I don’t know, a couple of months rest for sure. About a year ago I didn’t think I’d ever get around to finishing school, I was a couple classes short of an AA, and now I have 2 degrees! I definitely want to go back for the MSML as I read it synergizes well with the MBA for career growth. With the overlap I’d only need about 5 more classes. I’ll put it on the back burner for now until I reach a point in my career where I’ll need the advantage, for now 2 master’s degrees won’t give me an immediate benefit (but having 1 does 😊).  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Recent Graduate's WGU Comp Sci Program Review and Ideal/Suggested Course List\\n# Overall Writeup of Classes Taken While at WGU\\n\\nLONG post incoming....\\n\\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the classes I will write about will change and have changed from when I've taken them (in fact one class I initially started is no longer offered in the Comp Sci program).  WGU regularly updates classes, resources, PAs/OAs, etc... so this will only reflect my experience with the classes and how I felt about the classes looking back on them not to mention \"difficulty\" is an entirely arbitrary rating based on subjective experiences/interpretations.\\n\\nMy background/Context: I started in September of 2018 working full time as an analyst at a large company.  I don't have any major family obligations, but did have some issues come up during my time at WGU which impacted how quickly I progressed through the program.\\n\\n## Overall Review\\n\\nOverall I think this is a solid program, like others I have my gripes about it in terms of resources, specific classes I'd like to see, and some of the certs, but all in all it covers enough to be a solid starting point when it comes to Computer Science.\\n\\nIn terms of areas of improvement I think that WGU could provide a better onboarding experience.  I remember being totally confused by how PAs versus OAs versus PA classes worked, for those reading this who are considering enrolling, PA can be either a \"Pre-Assessment\" (AKA: a practice test) or a \"Project-Assessment\" (AKA: complete a paper/code project and submit it for evaluation) with an OA being an \"Objective Assessment\" (AKA: a final composed (usually) of multiple choice questions).  The testing process gets even more confusing with multiple testing centers/requirements since different certs have different expectations.\\n\\nI was also initially confused by how mentors worked (basically you check in with them weekly in order to ensure that you're on track/not running into any roadblocks).  After changing mentors multiple times due to internal WGU changes, I ended up with an amazing mentor, and I can say without a doubt that a good mentor can make a world of difference that makes or breaks things for you.  Your mentor should align with you and your needs, all of my mentors were fine, but I had one or two where although we got along we had different ideas and concepts on how to approach classes that made it more difficult for me, but my final mentor was EXTREMELY easy to work with, understanding, and gave me the tools I needed to succeed.\\n\\nLike anything else there are tradeoffs with the program.  The WGU Comp Sci program is extremely convenient and flexible, especially for someone like me who was/is working full time, the tradeoff with it is that some of the resources could be better and it's not as specialized as other programs, but for me it was worth it.\\n\\nIf you're reading this wondering if you should enroll in WGU since everyone's situation is different, know what you want out of it going in, leverage the advantages you have, and do your best to decide if the program is right for you.\\n\\nIf someone were getting ready to prepare for starting the program who had no background in IT/computer science I'd recommend a few things:\\n\\n1. Do certification or two such as Net+, A+, Project+, etc... All of them are established, have solid study material, and are close to what you can expect with the program.  This is especially useful if you don't have background in IT and can be a decent benchmark for understanding potential areas of improvement.\\n2. Take as many classes as you can through Staighterline, Study.com, etc... just make it easier (and likely cheaper) on yourself.\\n3. Take about a month or so (especially if it's your first programming language/experience) and learn Python, it's relatively easy to read, and quick to pick up. Automate the Boring Stuff is a good resource and there are tons of YouTube tutorials on Python.  Go through all the standard stuff including variables, loops, branching/control flow, functions, and classes/object oriented programming.  Once you know enough to be able to comfortably build a \"car\" class and associated functions you're good.\\n\\n## C172 - Network and Security Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis class was relatively straightforward for me, I was able to reach out to my mentor and get some additional material, but covering IP address, networking hardware and its capabilities/limitations, and network security are pretty much what I remember from this course.\\n\\n## C173 - Scripting and Programming Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis class is reasonably easy even if they do throw some curveballs/unexpected bits at you in terms of the range of algorithms/languages you'll see on the OA.  As long as you can recognize programming languages, some of their eccentricities/concepts, and major algorithms, you'll have most of it down for this OA and this class\\n\\n## C177 - Business of IT - Project Management\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class was the CompTIA Project+ certification and resulted in memorizing a lot of jargon and business processes.  While I think it gives a good overview and insight into the business side of things this class can be tedious.  Because of the way that CompTIA structures, words, and writes their exams, I remember this exam giving me anxiety because it seemed like so many answers could fit a given question and being frustrated with having to choose the \"best\" answer.\\n\\n## C182 - Introduction to IT\\n\\nDifficulty: 2/10\\n\\nThis class is a good overview and introduction to most things IT and the OA isn't too bad and doesn't throw any real curveballs as I recall.\\n\\n## C779 - Web Development Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class at the time I took it was strangely difficult, not necessarily because of the content but because the class was outdated in several ways and because of the way the questions were framed.  I sincerely hope they've updated this class since, but it did make me more familiar with web concepts, accessibility, and other aspects of the web.\\n\\n## C958 - Calculus 1\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class took me about 4 months and the primary reason why I passed is because of Khan Academy's Calculus AB which gave me all the skills I needed to pass and in my opinion was far better than the ZyBook.\\n\\n## C867 - Scripting and Programming Applications\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class was a challenge and took me a month to complete.  Being the first hands on/coding class it definitely introduced a number of concepts and ideas that were tough to implement.  I know that they've removed the Book Keeping video series that went along with this class, and hope that they bring some kind of video/lecture series to accompany this class, because it's easy to see how students could get overwhelmed if this is their first time programming.\\n\\n## C959 - Discrete Math 1\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was a lot of material to cover with a fair amount of detail and minute.  I remember having to make a substatinial number of notecards for this class and cover the logic rules especially hard.  I failed the OA the first time because of all the trouble I had with proofs.  Once you get past Unit 1 it gets to be more manageable though.\\n\\n## C175 - Data Management Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nThis class wasn't too bad, but for it I relied heavily on outside sources in order to better understand ETL, E-R diagrams, normalization, and the basic concepts of databases.  Overall a solid introduction to databases.\\n\\n## C170 - Data Management Applications\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis class was a good application of everything that C175 - Data Management Foundations introduced and was made a ton easier by the labs and being able to repeatedly practice what needed to be known for the OA.\\n\\n## C952 - Computer Architecture\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was a lot, not only because the textbook is so lengthy and goes into a lot of detail (if I recall correctly it's a grad level textbook), but because it covers so much it's not 100% certain what will be on the OA.  Luckily there is/was a study guide on the course chatter that was good preparation for the OA.  In general this class should be more concise and focused to introduce the necessary concepts.\\n\\n## C846 - Business of IT Applications\\n\\nDifficulty: 4/10\\n\\nThis was another tedious class since it's ITIL and I would HIGHLY recommend taking C177 - Business of IT - Project Management (AKA: Project+) before this class as the vocabulary/process for learning stuff is much the same and had some overlap for me.  The ITIL app for practice tests and vocabulary cards was invaluable here.\\n\\n## C960 - Discrete Math 2\\n\\nDifficulty: 8/10\\n\\nThis for me, hands down was the most challenging class in the entire program.  Other people will definitely disagree with me here, as I've seen a number of posts saying that it was relatively easy for them, for me it took 3 terms (18 months) to pass this class and 3 tries at the OA.  This class has a lot of material, and a lot of detail associated with all of that material.  Specifically sections 4 and 5 covering probability and Bayes' theorem were the most challenging aspects for me and unit 3 on recursion seemed to be almost useless in the ZyBook.  I had to HEAVILY rely on outside resources on this one and at one point had daily calls with mentors to go over questions, concepts, and material.  I genuinely want them to make a video companion series to go along with this class at some point.\\n\\n## C188 - Software Engineering\\n\\nDifficulty: 3/10\\n\\nThis class was fairly easy as it is a paper that is straightforward and clear in what is needed and expected.  Overall it took under a week to do everything that was required of the paper that needed some research to complete.  Overall I wouldn't change this class too much.\\n\\n## C191 - Operating Systems for Programmers\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was another class that was primarily vocabulary based, but it was within a much broader context that required connecting the vocabulary learned to the larger concepts the illustrated.  Overall not a bad class, just a large word dump in some ways that I didn't fully appreciate.\\n\\n## C482 - Software 1\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class was a struggle as it introduced a number of new things, but it really helped me grow as a programmer in terms of organizing the code, how to approach things, and internalizing new concepts.  I enjoyed it overall.\\n\\n## C195 - Advanced Java Concepts\\n\\nDifficulty: 7/10\\n\\nThis class really builds on C482 - Software 1 and extends it and I was grateful for that since it introduced some new challenges and things to consider that I hadn't thought of before.  Overall another fun project class that could be frustrating at times due to the challenges presented.\\n\\n## C836 - Fundamentals of Information Security\\n\\nDifficulty: 3/10\\n\\nIf I recall correctly I did this class over a weekend, if you've already taken C172 - Network and Security Foundations there is some overlap for the security section here.  Knowing the CIA triad and security approaches/attacks is what is focused on here and was a fun class for me since I enjoy InfoSec stuff.\\n\\n## C857 - Software Quality Assurance\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThis class is useful in how it introduces testing concepts and terminology, but the book wasn't the best, and the lectures/slides that went along with this class pretty much said the same thing.  I know this is one of the classes that they've changed/updated since I've taken, ESPECIALLY since it was first introduced and was a total mess in terms of the mis-alignment between expectations on the PA and the OA.\\n\\n## C950 - Data Structures and Algorithms 2\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nI thought that this class was a fun challenge and really focused on optimization and organization.  Overall I learned a fair bit from this class about Python and I found the class enjoyable.\\n\\n## C951 - Intro to AI\\n\\nDifficulty: 5/10\\n\\nI got the second version of this class with 2 projects (chatbot AI and BubbleRob) and a paper.  I thought that the paper worked REALLY well going into the Capstone and although the projects were slightly tedious, they taught me a fair amount about the limitations and considerations when it comes to AI.\\n\\n## D191 - Advanced Data Management\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nDatabases aren't my thing, but I found this class useful for understanding how to effectively implement JOINS and more complex queries in PSQL.  The lab(s)/virtual environment were useful here for being able to practice for the PA.\\n\\n## D194 - IT Leadership Foundations\\n\\nDifficulty: 3/10\\n\\nThis class is easy as it relies on a self-evaluation and the associated paper.  It gives some language and insight into various strengths/areas of improvement and can be done over a weekend or less.\\n\\n## C964 - Capstone\\n\\nDifficulty: 6/10\\n\\nThe Capstone is a project that you design and implement (within the constraints of the requirements for it to be viable for a business product that uses machine learning in some way).  For me I implemented something using Python/Flask and and HTML/JS dashboard.  From what I gather most people often end up using Python because of its extensive ML libraries and its relative ease of use.  For me this was a fun challenge that I got to write about and wouldn't mind if I had to do something like this again.\\n\\n## Course Order Recommendation\\n\\nNOTE: I transferred in with a degree from a previous institution that took care of most/all of my gen-eds so modify this list as you see fit and with what works best for you in discussions with your mentor.\\n\\nLooking through my transcript, and thinking back on my time at WGU, this is the course order I would take if I had to do it over again.  Others are likely, and welcome, to disagree, but this is ideally what would have worked for me and my needs.\\n\\nI'll present the classes in blocks of what would be expected in a term (usually 4 classes sometimes less) followed by why I think the classes belong in that particular block.\\n\\nAgain, this list is based off of the classes that I had to finish, so your mileage may vary.\\n\\nIn speaking with my mentor(s), the classes that most often trip people up are as follows:\\n\\n* The math class(es)\\n* Scripting and Programming Applications\\n* Data Structures and Algorithms 2\\n\\nBeyond that I've also seen people struggle with\\n\\n* Networking and Security\\n* Business of IT and/or project management because it's so jargon heavy\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 1 (The setup block)\\n\\nC958 - Calculus 1\\n\\nC182 - Intro to IT\\n\\nC959 - Discrete Math 1\\n\\nC173 - Scripting and Programming Foundations\\n\\nThis block is set up so that it goes from a challenging class (calc) to an easier one (intro to IT), then a challenging class again (DM1) and then sets you up to start learning programming fundamentals and prepare for DM2\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 2 (The DM2 and errata block)\\n\\nC949 - Data Structures/Algos 1\\n\\nC960 - Discrete Math 2\\n\\nC779 - Web Development Foundations\\n\\nC176 - Business of IT/Project Management OR C172 - Network and Security Foundations\\n\\nThis block has a bit of everything from more DM2 prep with DSA1 to DM2 to some HTML/CSS with Web dev foundations and one of more jargon heavy/tech heavy classes in either project management or networking.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 3 (The database block)\\n\\nC175 - Data Management Foundations\\n\\nC170 - Data Management Applications\\n\\nD191 - Advanced Data Management\\n\\nC176 - Business of IT/Project Management OR C172 - Network and Security Foundations (whichever one you did NOT take in the previous block)\\n\\nThis block progressively builds on everything with databases and streamlines it, and then adds in the additional class of either project management or networking that is still outstanding\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 4 (The programming, business, and theory block)\\n\\nC867 - Scripting and Programming Applications\\n\\nC846 - Business of IT Applications\\n\\nC188 - Software Engineering\\n\\nC952 - Computer Architecture\\n\\nThis block encompasses a little bit of everything, it moves from hands on programming in Scripting/Programming Applications to more business and jargon heavy stuff with Business of IT applications, and moves the the relatively easy software engineering and then finishes up with the challenging computer architecture\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 5 (The programming heavy block)\\n\\nC482 - Software 1\\n\\nC195 - Software 2 Advanced Java Concepts\\n\\nD194 - IT Leadership Foundations\\n\\nBoth of the classes listed above are 6 units each and are therefore a full term.  I do think that these classes should be back to back as the concepts you'll use from Java/Java FX in software one are directly applicable to Software 2, software 2 just adds databases and a couple of extra things on top of it.  To finish up is IT leadership foundations which is a personality self assessment and associated paper(s) that can be done in a weekend (or less).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 6 (The almost there block)\\n\\nC191 - Operating Systems for Programmers\\n\\nC836 - Fundamental of Information Security\\n\\nC951 - Intro to AI\\n\\nC857 - Software Quality Assurance\\n\\nThis block throws together a lot of stuff, with OS there is some overlap with computer architecture from block 4, fundamentals of information security is made easier if you've already gone through networking as some of the same topics are covered.  Intro to AI isn't too tough of a course and prepares you for the Capstone in the next block and software quality assurance is a solid class after they've gone through and updated it/the material for it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBlock 7 (The finish line)\\n\\nC950 - Data Structures and Algorithms 2\\n\\nC964 - Computer Science Capstone\\n\\nOK, that's it for me.  Given such a long post with a number of moving parts, I've probably made some mistakes in here, feel free to let me know and I'll correct it.  If you have any other questions posted in the comments I'll do my best to respond to them.  \n",

                                                                               30 Day MBA Experience Executive Summary\\nEDIT:  In response to a comment that there's \"something I'm not telling you\", I decided to add a section prior to C202 explaining how I used the time after orientation to help me prepare. Contrary to the person's assumptions/accusations, I did not engage in pre-writing, nor did I solicit rubrics, pre-written papers, etc., but I did make use of the time in relevant ways that I will describe further below.\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nI started my MBA on 4/1 officially, got my capstone final task approved on 4/29, and have successfully filed for my diploma and graduation. I wanted to thank all of the folks on this Reddit, along with those on Facebook (the WGU Business page, as well as the WGU accelerators page) for the information and the support that they've provided, which were a big help in me finishing when I could. Below is a summary of my experience, a couple of tips, and a small description of how I approached each course.\\n\\nOverall notes\\n\\nI loved my program mentor overall. One thing I did need to get used to was that she opened C200, C202, and C204 to start, and wouldn't really open courses for me until I finished all of the courses. This was annoying because there were a couple of times early that I needed to wait (it was really like a day or so, but at my pace I didn't want to lose days). So, I needed to establish a pace where I let her know ahead when I finished one course, and she would accelerate the next one while I finished the other (after the first set of three, I pretty much had two at a time open). She did let me choose my sequence after the first 3, so I was strategic on my choices based on what I knew (OA vs Performance Assessment, how I did on the pre-assessment, existing knowledge, etc.). Below are some details on my experience with each, and how I made decisions within each course that ultimately led to my success.\\n\\n**Edit: Added this paragraph below since I remembered it while rewriting the other things.** \\n\\nTip for the OAs: Sometimes the proctor's aren't available right at the time (e.g., sometimes it's 8:07 for an 8:00 PM and the proceed button isn't available). If it takes too long (which happened to me a couple of times, but some people complained about it a ton on Facebook), I would just use the chat feature on the bottom right and let them know. The couple of times I did this (literally 2 times), they were able to get me started within about 5minutes or so. As a generally rule, I'd plan for about 15-20 minutes longer than your anticipated start time and completion time when you are scheduling your tests. This seemed to piss a lot of people off, but my feeling is if you plan on it being 15-20 minutes longer, then just be patient (you'll be fine waiting a bit, no big deal). I do get that some people are REALLY constrained for time, so I get it, but plan for it and you'll generally be fine with the proctors as long as you follow the rules (in my experience, at least).\\n\\n*Orientation - Completed on 3/15*\\n\\nThis was quite easy - just complete all of the required tasks. Was more than I expected to need to do, but was my first experience in seeing the rubrics, the submission system, etc. Was not a big deal.\\n\\n**EDIT:  Paragraphs below have been added to describe my use of pre-launch time, a critical phase to my final completion time.**\\n\\n*Pre-Launch - 16 days (3/15-3/31)*\\n\\nAn important part of my MBA time was some of the work I did during the pre-launch time. I want to emphasize that I used solely information available on the \"Class Preview\" versions of the site (which allows access to the pre-assessments and the course resource pages, I think). I took all the pre-assessments, passing all of them except for Financial Management, which I failed bit just a little bit. The pre-assessments let me know what areas I was weakest in, which were relevant in helping me determine which areas to focus on. Another thing that I did was be aware of what textbooks were used for the courses (using Reddit, primarily). While I was not able to obtain most of the books (e.g., those posted on 3rd party online sources such as Accounting), I was able to find similar books/older editions that I could use. There isn't really enough time to read all of the textbooks, but I did use some of this time to studying an older version of the book for C202 (a Human Resources book). Because this topic was new to me, I did read more or less the entire book (and because I did not have access to a lot of other stuff). That was the main book I read ahead of time (the other book I read completely was Accounting, another area completely new to me, but I did in fact do that during the term). Other than that reading, the other thing I did was curate all of the resources I could from the course websites about each of the tasks. Reddit provided some info, and the website constructed some info. Note that not all classes have slides/tips on the resources, so for some tasks I was more or less left in the dark (although I could determine from the Reddit posts of others *generally* what they are. I engaged a lot in \"brainstorming\" about each of the papers (e.g., if a paper was talking about an individual, I thought about who I would write about and what I would write). I did not, however, prep any materials ahead of time, partially due to the fact that you cannot view any of the rubrics, and it is generally suggested to write to the rubric (which I think is solid advice). One thing I did do that was helpful was copy and paste the instructions into the assignments and fill out my papers kind of like a worksheet (Section A - response for Section A. Section B - responses for Section B... etc.). This helped with ensuring that I met all of the rubric requirements and helped the evaluators find information (I did require a handful of revisions throughout, which I will generally note). The revisions tended not to waste too much time, as I tried to always have a second course open so that I could work on that while I waited for revisions to be approved for the other (you need mentor support in making sure things are open when you need them, and my mentor wouldn't allow me to have more than 2 open at a time, other than at the beginning when I had the first 3 open).\\n\\nI want to reiterate that I did not have the rubrics ahead of time, write a single page ahead of time, or read through/copy/receive any assignments from anyone else. Every single thing I wrote was my own work, and inspired only by the textbooks and papers I read (in a few small cases).  In any case, I used the time to scour the site for any and all information I could use to help me be mentally prepared for the tasks. When 4/1 hit (in fact, several hours into it, because materials don't really launch until noon on the first day typically, which I didn't know ahead of time), I was good to begin my work on the first 3 courses.\\n\\n*C202 - Managing Human Capital (1 OA) - 1 day (4/1)*\\n\\nThis was my first OA. I took the pre-assessment and passed, so I felt confident going in. To prep for this course, I read through the whole textbook at a light skim, picked up some things I didn't know before, and focused on particular points I recognized from the PA that I wanted to focus more on (and read more thoroughly in those sections). I took this test on the first evening after my skim/lighter reading and was all set. I could not open other courses at this point, so I continued with C200, which was already open, but would require more time (as it was a PA course).\\n\\n*C200 - Managing Organizations and Leading People (2 PA tasks, both papers) - 4 days from open (4/4)*\\n\\nThis course required two performance assessments, as well as a leadership assessment (CliftonStrengths) as part of one of the tasks. These were both very manageable tasks. I spent the most time in this class reading through a couple of papers to find good sources (this was actually one of the few that I had to/bothered to do this in). These look me a bit longer than average to complete compared to the others, so it took me a couple of days to get it done. In terms of reading, I looked at the materials related to the tasks (and the relevant papers). I did not look at any of the other course materials. After finishing this, I had C211 opened.\\n\\n*C211 - Global Economics for Managers (1 OA) - 2 days (4/6)*\\n\\nI passed this pre-assessment as well (although more marginally), so I wanted to take this one out. Apparently, a lot of people do find this test hard, but I did take Economics in college, and have made some efforts to learn some of these things on my own in the past. I focused on a read/skim approach on my areas of weakness from the pre-assessment, and was able to pass this pretty quickly (2 days after opening it). Test was absolutely fine, but my light approach to reading (only reading a couple of small areas) led to only a marginal improvement from the pre-assessment to the OA, but it was a solid pass, so it was good enough. With this done, I focused on C204 (my last remaining class). I think I was slowed down a bit, as my mentor made me wait until finishing C204 before I could continue (which annoyed me a bit, but forced me to focused on that next).\\n\\n*C204 - Management Communication (2 tasks - 1 paper, and 1 presentation/video/executive summary) - 8 days (4/8)*\\n\\nThis one took me a bit longer because the work was a bit more extensive. I also was traveling on 4/2-4/4, and on 4/5, so I was only able to do this on 4/8 after I was done traveling (as I needed to make a video presentation). These tasks were more extensive, so there was a lot more work involved. I relied on the textbook only, and focused exclusively on the sections related to the tasks. I maybe BARELY did a light skim on other materials, but honestly skipped a lot of it, as it was not relevant to what I needed to do. The tasks ultimately went down pretty easily (once I sat down to do them). I had to slow down a lot because of all the traveling and needing to shoot the video, but things sped up a bit from here for a while. This allowed me to open up C215.\\n\\n*C215 - Operations Management (1 OA) - 1 day (4/9)*\\n\\nFor this one, I BARELY touched the book (except for some last minute skimming the last hour before the exam). I passed the pre-assessment (barely), so I felt ok, but I focused on watching Dr. Haywood's videos on youtube (which tons of people recommended). Watching these boosted my knowledge about the area quite a bit (although he doesn't really touch any of the math, which isn't needed anyways). I was able to pass this OA immediately pretty much because I had watched all the videos. With that knowledge, it was pretty easy. The videos are very easy to understand and help with the OA a lot, so I HIGHLY recommend watching them (and use the book as a supplement too, if you need/want to). After this, I had C206 opened, and C207 opened (I was able to get two courses at a time by this point, which allowed me some flexibility in working on tasks)\\n\\n*C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs - all papers) - 4 days (4/13, including revision time)*\\n\\nThis one required a LOT of writing, as it is three papers! That said, a lot is based on other materials (case study, ethical leadership inventory, code of ethics), and so I barely touched the course text materials at all. I just diligently wrote and got everything done. I had to do a couple of revisions here because there was a lot to write and I missed a couple of things here and there, but it was easy once I knew what was missing to fill in the gaps. Revisions took me an extra day or so (one happened on day 3 for a task I submitted earlier, and another happened on day 4, which was what moved me to 4 days for the course. After this, I went to C207, which I already had open.\\n\\n*C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (1 OA, 2 PAs) - 5 days after open (4/14, including revision time)*\\n\\nI have a lot of expertise and experience and did well on the pre-assessment, so I looked at pretty much nothing here. I was able to do the two PAs pretty quickly, but also quickly realized that I didn't know what they were asking for in places (I felt the wording was strange). I had to resubmit both of these, and even had to do one of them a total of 3 times to pass. These also, for some reason, required getting instructor approval. This was the one course I worked with the prof but I did take advantage of it by asking them to look at the work. They gave me some tips that were helpful in terms of understanding what they wanted and I was able to pass (although it took more revisions across the board than any other course). Without studying, I took the OA, and was able to pass that (although I scored about the same as the pre-assessment, which makes sense). The OA was harder than I Was expecting, so I was a bit disappointed. Nevertheless, I finished this and was able to move on to C212.\\n\\n*C212 - Marketing (1 PA) - 1 day (4/15)*\\n\\nThis class required one pretty long paper. I looked at only the materials related to the paper and nothing else. I wrote the paper in about 4 hours, I think (ignoring my actual job that day...oops). I passed quite easily in one attempt (just was a lot of writing). This allowed me to move on to C213\\n\\n*C213 - Accounting for Decision-makers (1 OA) - 7 days (4/22)*\\n\\nI was a bit concerned about this course, as it was pretty much all brand new to me, and because I knew it was considered one of the two hardest classes (behind Financial management). For this one, I read the book cover to cover. I had passed the pre-assessment marginally using prior knowledge, but reading the book helped a ton, and I passed the OA fairly easily after all the studying. I had gone out of town for a few days again, so it took some time before I could sit for the exam. I used a few days to read all of the book pages, and then used the rest of the time to focus on C214 before sitting for this exam.\\n\\n*C214 - Financial Management (1 OA) - 1 day (4/23)*\\n\\nThis was the one pre-assessment I failed (barely), and I knew this was a hard course. After opening the course, I learned that the videos provided on the site (rather than the book) were the most useful materials. I basically read through a few chapters while working through the accounting, and then switched to the videos after learning about them. The videos (posted on the course site) were about 4.5 hours or so, and were all I studied other than those few chapters I read before. I did not watch the additional 1 hour calculations video that was also available because I felt I knew enough. That said, there was a LOT of math on the OA, and I honestly didn't know how to get the calculator (I had the TI BA II recommended calculator). That all said, I passed with a pretty good score (I think I may have guessed well in a few places where I couldn't figure out the calculator as well. I sat for this exam one day after C213, and was done with this course. This test took me like 1 hour and 40 minutes total (far longer than any other exam, which generally ranged from 30-60 minutes for me). But I passed and moved forward, leaving only the capstone.\\n\\n*C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs) - 4 days (4/27)*\\n\\nFor this, there was a business simulation and two associated tasks, as well as a profession portfolio PA. I had pretty much everything I needed for the portfolio, so this took a couple of hours to knock out and prepare for submission. However, I did need to finish the simulation and the two tasks first. Task 2 must be completed after Task 1 is passed, so I did task 1's simulation part and finished the task, and had to wait a day before getting to Task 2. After that, I finished the simulation (which I thought was an AMAZING way to integrate all that I studied and learned), and then completed Task 2. Both of these tasks passed within one attempt, and I submitted Task 2 simultaneously with Task 3, and my last days just involved waiting for approval, which happened yesterday (4/29).\\n\\nAfter all this, I filled out the graduation paperwork and am waiting on that. With all that, I completed my work within 27 days, and am slated for graduated after 29. It was quite a road, and a lovely experience. I'd love to study more if it wouldn't cost another 5k, and am eager to see what's next.\\n\\nI'm happy to share this with all of you, and am also happy to answer any questions that anyone might have! I would highly recommend this process, especially for motivated folks who can work well independently, and hope that I can use what I've learned for my work in the near future!  \n",

Written Guides\\nAll,\\n\\nI couldn't have accomplished all that I did without the help of reddit threads and resources, so I'm excited to give back. I want this to become a one-stop-shop for future accelerators, so I've tried my best to dump everything in one spot. Hope it helps!\\n\\nResources:\\n\\n1. [My Full MBA Journey & Advice](https://youtu.be/bozAL8FguH8)\\n2. [How I got every Capstone Excellence Award & top 10% globally on the simulation](https://youtu.be/gDhBwrhvmEc)\\n3. [u/Sleyk2010 MBA Speedrun Guide (Not Mine: Somewhat dated, but Very Useful)](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\n  \\n**On Legitimizing Acceleration:**\\n\\nA common argument against acceleration is “But how much did you really learn?” I believe that the Excellence Award provides the perfect counter to this argument. By proving a MASTERY of concepts in the degree plan, you get to prove your business chops while getting an extra few resume items to stand out in applications. (Also, nobody NEEDS to know how fast you earned your degree) \\n\\nAnother Piece of advice: **Do your assignments on real businesses.** This gives you more experience in the course material and further legitimizes your resume with real-world projects. For example, instead of just writing a marketing proposal for a fictional business, reach out to a business in your community and do work for them. Many of the assignments can help real businesses if you’re creative enough… You’re already doing the work; you might as well allow somebody else to profit from it.\\n\\n\\n\\nRules: updated from [This AMAZING resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/)\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n* WRITE TO THE RUBRIC – A strategy that I developed for papers was to upload [This Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6FWjGvKR5H7DCgRaLvpmh5rssFz-0RS/view?usp=sharing) onto Google Docs, add each section of the rubric to the paper with a comment describing the requirements, and open the resource manager. This gives you everything you need on one screen, with the added benefit of being transferable between devices. By doing this, I was able to write most assignments in 2-3 fewer pages than recommended and still pass the first try. (For a visual demo go to 5:28 in [My Full MBA Journey & Advice](https://youtu.be/bozAL8FguH8))\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s**~~: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est~~* ***~~pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try~~***~~\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*~~\\n\\n* Not True – **I would actually recommend doing the opposite**. I would intentionally fail the pretest to give myself a better understanding of what to study for the real exam. (I’ll break this strategy down later)\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\n* The best part about failing is that they will tell you exactly what (and sometimes how) to fix. This can be great for speedrunning because it allows you to quickly submit your fist draft and let the instructor tell you which areas need improvement **instead of worrying about if you did enough.**\\n\\n\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n* **Course Resources:** This should be THE FIRST place you go when enrolling in a course. It will have helpful resources that explain, in great detail, what the instructors are looking for in the assignment\\n   * Course Resources will have everything you need to pass - I wouldn’t bother with external resources like quizlet unless something really isn’t clicking.\\n* **Using the Pretest:** This strategy helped me crush my courses with OA’s: \\n   * Take the test immediately – \\n      * **Don’t Guess!** If the question seems common sense, guess; however, if it’s something like an equation that you don’t know how to solve, leave it blank. This will let you ID which questions you will need to explicitly study before trying the real exam.\\n   * Review the sections you failed\\n   * Review the exam questions right before the test to see how much you improved / ID any “gotcha” questions.\\n   * Don’t retake the pretest – go straight to the final and take it. \\n   * Good Luck :)\\n* **Schedule your test as soon as the option is available**. This instantly gives you a deadline to beat procrastination. If you don’t feel ready, you can always reschedule for an hour or two later, but having a deadline will help you stay motivated and not waste time studying.\\n* Do yourself a favor and **download the free Grammarly plugin.**\\n\\n\\n\\nOutline:\\n\\nMy Overall advice is to **speedrun the degree, master the capstone.** For me, *burnout came from going slower, not faster.* It’s easy to begin overthinking assignments and slowly lose traction. I believe that the best way to get through the degree is to produce a minimally viable project, submit it, and then revise if needed. Then, when capstone comes, go all out and show off everything you’ve learned.\\n\\n\\n\\nORA -1 \\n\\nTake care of this as soon as possible. PLEASE Don’t be like me and wait until the semester begins. Because I waited so long, it delayed my actual start date by 1 day :(\\n\\n\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital - **Super easy, 1 Day, 2 papers, (15 pages total).**\\n\\nEZPZ class. The link for the Signature Themes can be hard to find, so I’ll add it here, but once you’ve done that, just write to the rubric. Once you’ve done that, assignment one is easy. They recommend breaking it up over 5 days… you can do it in about 3-4 hours once you have the report. The second paper is just a rubric-based rant. As long as you can find scholarly articles and USE THE CITATION MANAGER, you can easily get this course done in a day. \\n\\n\\n\\nC200 - Managing Organizations and Leading People - **Super easy, 1 Day, 1 Exam**\\n\\nAfter submitting C202’s essays, I did the pretest before bed and passed - there are a lot of common sense questions. It took me a little longer to complete this course because I had to figure out how to use the online proctoring service. The hardest part about this course is convincing yourself that you’re ready without reading anything. Once I did that, I scheduled the exam, reviewed the practice test, and passed the real exam.\\n\\n\\n\\nMGT2 – IT Project Management - **Easy/medium but fun, 2-3 days, 3 papers**\\n\\nTIP: Make sure you check the bottom of the assignments tab for assignment templates. \\n\\nThis course, probably because it’s more technical, had tutorials for each of the assignments. I would HIGHLY recommend following those tutorials step-by-step to ensure that you meet the criteria for the assignments. I made the mistake of thinking I could make a better GANTT chart with better software, only to have to redo the entire thing in ProjectLibre (their recommended software) to meet the criteria of the assignment. Though it was tedious, it was VERY relevant to the field of IT which made it interesting and reliable for me. As long as you follow the rubrics and the tutorials, you can complete it in 2 days.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\*\\*\\* I took 9 days off because my family was in town. During this time, IT PM class sent back assignments for revisions. It was a nice little break :) \\*\\*\\*\\n\\n\\n\\nC213 – Accounting for Decision Makers - Medium Class,  3ish days, 1 exam\\n\\nWhen I took the pretest for this course, I failed every section, so this was the first course that I actually spent time going through course materials. This is the first class where my testing strategy (described above) can really help you dial in on what to study. Depending on your exposure to accounting (I had none), this may be a tough class. That being said, it’s easy to overstudy, which is definitely what happened to me. I would recommend learning about the 3 financial statements in detail and just reading the summary of all the other chapters (usually the first and last sections in each chapter).\\n\\n\\n\\nC212 – Marketing - Medium, 1 day, 1 essay\\n\\nOne long paper, but if you **apply it to a real-world project**, it can be really fun and motivating. For me, my friend has always thought about starting his own business, so it was really cool to talk to him about his business one day and send him a 13 page marketing plan the next. My only advice is to make sure you follow the rubric and check out the course resources for a video explanation. The video will tell you where to locate some of course-material-related requirements. It’s easy to accomplish in a day if you’ve got the stamina.\\n\\n\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management - \\n\\nIf you don’t need a break after Accounting, I would recommend taking financial management right after it.\\n\\nI failed the pretest, but this gave me an opportunity to discover something that CHANGED THE GAME: **The Course Resources tab**. Each course has a section where the instructors have compiled bootcamps, webinars, and additional worksheets specifically targeted to helping you pass your final (Test or Exam). By using these resources, I scheduled my exam for the next day and passed. For the rest of the challenge, whenever I started a new class, the first place I checked was the Course Resources tab. \\n\\n\\n\\nMMT2 – IT Strategic Solutions - Medium difficulty, 5 days, 3 assignments\\n\\nMy advice is to start this course as soon as it becomes available - you have to complete one assignment before you can start the next. This course was a masterclass in waiting - You wait for an instructor’s approval signature before you can submit the first assignment and then wait in between each assignment.If you’re accelerating, it’s even more important to make sure you’re writing to the rubric because having to redo any of the assignments will set everything back. I’d recommend submitting an assignment and then starting on another course while you’re waiting to maximize your time.\\n\\n\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership - Easy class, 1 day, 3 essays\\n\\nFor the first assignment, you need to take the Ethical Lens test [https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/98150994](https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/98150994) \\- The first assignment is pretty much just rephrasing the report. The next two assignments aren’t bad - I had to reference the textbook for a few of the sections, but as long as you follow the rubric, you’ll be fine.\\n\\nAnother cool thing that happened was that I got notified of my FIRST Excellence Award!!! This changed everything… Thankfully, I only had 2 courses left.\\n\\n\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers, Hardest Class (for me), 2-3 days, 1 Exam\\n\\nWay more difficult than people give it credit for… If you’re new to Economics, there are a lot of things that don’t mean what you think they would mean. Even so, I’d recommend taking the pre-test right away, watching all of the review sessions in the course resources, \\n\\n\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making - Medium Class, 1-2 days, 1 exam + 2 assignments\\n\\nI think there’s a lot of bad intel about this course - yes, it has a test and 2 assignments, but there are course resources that pretty much explain how to perform all the calculations for the analysis. I completed the course little differently: I took the exam then started on the assignments. Looking back, I think that this helped me to study what was important without getting lost in the details. If I hadn’t had to submit Task 1 (2 times) and task 2 (3 times), I would have completed everything in a day. I say all this to encourage you that it’s not as bad as people make it sound :)\\n\\n\\n\\nC218 – Capstone \\n\\nStart with this video: [How I got every Capstone Excellence Award & top 10% globally on the simulation](https://youtu.be/gDhBwrhvmEc)\\n\\nThis is a fun course, but it can easily spiral out of the timeframe you allow. For me, I wanted to take extra time because **I wanted an excellence award** for the whole program. Since they consider your performance in all the capstone assignments, I wanted to make sure they were as good as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6jabyafvdpe1.png?width=256&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0c78f6cdb4dc4bb1dc46cf622c7d793e686bbba\\n\\nCAPSIM: Very Fun. Looking back, I spent way too long optimizing minor decisions; however, it paid off because I was able to score in the top 10% globally on the simulation (to secure the CAPSIM Excellence Award). If you’re interested in overachieving, these are the resources that will help:\\n\\n* [How I got every Capstone Excellence Award & top 10% globally on the simulation](https://youtu.be/gDhBwrhvmEc)\\n* [https://www.reddit.com/user/thesocialbolt/comments/z53lu3/wgu\\_d361\\_business\\_simulation\\_how\\_i\\_completed\\_in\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/user/thesocialbolt/comments/z53lu3/wgu_d361_business_simulation_how_i_completed_in_1/)\\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/18nx1gn/mba\\_capstone\\_simulation\\_tips/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/18nx1gn/mba_capstone_simulation_tips/)\\n\\nTip: If you get top 10%, ADD YOUR BADGE TO LINKEDIN RIGHT AWAY!!! Once you finish the course, you lose access to the simulation and all your courses.\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i37o5nmhvdpe1.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=aed90fb65b1b406b263ce01ff71d859b3c105028\\n\\nAssignment 1: I went beast mode on this assignment – probably took a day to compile all the information for the assignment, but then I spent the rest of the week making sure that everything was perfect. If you’re interested in getting an excellence award, customize your template’s colors, change all the generic images, show the data to support your claims, and try to bring some personal information into the project. If not, you can just use the template and pretty quickly get all the information you need from the simulation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\*\\*\\* I took a 10 day break for a family Emergency \\*\\*\\*\\n\\n\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n5g249livdpe1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e63e768ff07b726b655309855b418a0d7e36060\\n\\nAssignment 2: This one wraps up the entire simulation - It’s a review of everything you did in the form of a stockholder report. They recommended \\~15 pages to complete it, but mine ended up being over 30 because I had a ton of stuff that I wanted to cover. If you put a decent bit of thought into your decisions in the simulation, finding content won’t be difficult as long as you use your tactical plan + Conscious reports. It’s also worth noting that they won’t give you your Capsim Excellence Award until after Assignment 2 has been evaluated.\\n\\n\\n\\nAssignment 3: While this assignment is the easiest one, it’s probably the most important. Building a resume and setting up a linkedin account is the perfect way to prepare for new jobs and show off your new degree (with excellence). \\n\\n\\n\\nNote from me:\\n\\nIf there’s one thing I’d love for you to take from reading this, it’s that **you can do it**. Whether or not you choose to accelerate, WGU provides you with everything you need to get through your courses and distinguish yourself with your degree. If you are accelerating, just know that fast doesn’t necessarily mean easy. Acceleration will make the degree way more difficult, but it’s totally worth it.\\n\\nIt’s probably worth mentioning that I had about 3 weeks of leave that I burned in the beginning. I added the details about my personal life to show that even when crazy things come up, you can still push through and keep making progress on your degree. If you don’t want to burn personal leave, you could probably knock out a course every weekend pretty easily.\\n\\nI’m truly thankful to WGU and all the redditors who helped encourage me to get my MBA. I hope that this post helps you on your journey :) Good luck!  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Review of all WGU classes I took + tips (as an experienced software engineer)\\nI have benefitted extensively from reddit and discord throughout this process, so I thought I would give back now that I passed the capstone. \\n\\nAs the title says, I'm an experienced engineer (\\~8 YOE), but I have worked mostly on front end web dev, almost exclusively React. I went to a 3 month bootcamp back in the day. I pretty much only wrote JavaScript before pursuing this degree, so a lot of this material was brand new to me. I do feel like I have a good handle of what is important to know and what isn't for work though, so hopefully this post will give you some insight into that. The following list of classes are in the order I passed them.\\n\\n* **Version Control – D197**: This class is insanely easy if you have worked in the industry even a little bit. It's just basic git commands. Took me 2 hours between activating the class and submitting my PA, and most of that time was just figuring out what the assignment wanted. If git is new to you, learn it well. This is extremely useful and important for any SWE job. Practice what you learned in this classes in every coding class going forward, even if commits are not a requirement.\\n\\n* **Scripting and Programming - Applications – C867:** I'll be honest, I was a bit humbled by this class. I thought I could knock it out in 2 days but I think it took me about a week instead. It's one of the better coding classes in my opinion. You have some autonomy in how you write the code. Best tip is to find that book repo collection of videos and really understand what each line of code is doing. I've never done C++ or any serious OOP before, so I enjoyed this class and I think it's overall a useful class to pay attention to.\\n* **Business of IT - Applications – D336:** This is the first class I absolutely hated from WGU. I worked in tech, have a BS is business, and still don't get the jargons you have to learn here. I thought this would be one of those easy to pass common sense classes, but it's like my brain operates on a different wavelength from the people writing this material. Best piece of study material is the [Jason Dion Cram Sheet](https://www.scribd.com/document/750810258/ITIL-4-Foundation-Cram-Card-pdf) and beyond that, just do as many practice problems as you can until you feel like 80% ready. This is absolutely not a class you need to pay attention to for work purposes. \\n* **Discrete Mathematics II – C960:** The first hard class I took, and I loved it. I spent a lot of time before WGU warming up on math. I did precalc and calc on Sophia, and DM1 on SDC. I was good at recursion and algorithms from my bootcamp days, so that's a good chunk I didn't have to relearn. My best tip for this class is to go through all the unit worksheets. I was very weak on counting and probability so I had chatgpt quiz me over and over until I felt somewhat solid. I wouldn't waste time configuring your calculator, but know how to do nPr and nCr (built in functions). Don't skimp on this class. You might not be asked how to do these specific problems in the interview process, but this will help tremendously once you start doing leetcode problems. This was my longest WGU OA by far. Time management is key. Skip questions you don't know or know will take a while, come back once you are done with the easier/faster questions. \\n* **Java Frameworks – D287:** I'll just start by saying all the Java classes in this program suck a$$. Watch a spring tutorial, learn Java if you haven't at this point, and just follow a reddit/discord guide to pass. I followed nusa's guide on discord. This project hurt my brain because it made no sense whatsoever, and I spent way too much time overthinking it. Take all the instructions literally. I added some very basic css styling and got an excellence award lmao. Focus on understanding what an MVC is and how Springboot works, but these Java projects are very poor example of what real software looks like.\\n* **Linux Foundations – D281:** There is a guide for learning this stuff and a guide for passing this class IYKYK. I really enjoyed Shawn Power's playlist on this, and I think it's a good watch. While it is not necessary to learn a lot of this stuff to pass, I would still pay attention to the materials of this class. Not only do you absolutely use some of this stuff in a work setting, you will have an easier time later on in OS and Comp Arch. Command line murder mystery is a fun exercise to learn the essentials. As for how to pass, just join the discord channel for the class. \\n* **Back-End Programming – D288:** As much as all these Java classes suck, this one is the worst. The course material wasn't helpful, and the CIs were so hit or miss. It seems like they want you to do more set up and experience more of the development process, but this was one of those classes that you have to follow instructions carefully in each step. Not a lot of creativity allowed here. Also, you can't properly test your code in each step. It's just all really unrealistic. I wouldn't dwell too much on this class. Go to the live instructor support sessions, get help ASAP when you are stuck, and move on as quickly as possible. If anyone is wondering, I did most of the coding in my local macos environment, but also ran it in the dev environment for submission.\\n* **Advanced Java – D387:** After suffering through the previous 2 Java classes, this one should be a breeze. It took me maybe a day to do this one. Interestingly, this one resembles real work a little more. The Angular part was easy for me, but I have a lot of FE experience. I think there's a webinar that shows you how to do it as well. The docker part might be the trickiest, but I would just play around with the config file and again, plan to talk with a CI as soon as you get stuck. \\n* **Software Engineering – D284:** This class doesn't really teach you any sort of engineering. It's mostly about the software development process. I guess the process of writing this paper helps one understand what goes into planning and developing software, but don't expect this to be how it works at your job. Everyone just uses some kind of agile and no one talks \"functional requirements\". There's probably more that's useful for PMs than engineers. It's all very academic imo. Also don't be afraid to repeat yourself and make things up. Have chatgpt explain any concepts to you that you are unfamiliar with. \\n* **Software Design and Quality Assurance – D480:** This class was so horrendously hard for me, I was doubting my intelligence. The evaluators for this class is notoriously picky, but I think I also had trouble understanding what the assignment wanted me to write. It's incredibly bizarre to write about architectural and process decisions when dealing with an incredibly trivial bug. I had so many fail points in both tasks that I knew I needed to meet with an instructor to figure out what the disconnect was. I actually have a ton of debugging and testing experience, so I was very frustrated. The CI I met with told me a student was on his 6th or 7th revision. Speechless. I ended up passing on attempt 2 for both tasks. The main things I missed was 1) only front end changes should be talked about, 2) the functional requirements are the 2 different cases described 3) \"objective\" of (non)functional requirements is basically asking about why we need the requirements. Meeting with the instructors helped, but they are ultimately not the evaluators. I think learning about the different types of quality metrics and testing methodologies are useful, but overall, this class was just busy work that is poorly designed and pedantically evaluated. As someone who prefers PAs, this class would be so much better if it was an OA instead.\\n* **Data Structures and Algorithms II – C950:** I love DSA, so while this class was a lot of work, I was a fan. This might be the highest quality class of the whole program. You have total control over your environment, how the files are setup, what algorithm to use, and how you present the UI.  For this class, I read through the requirements for both tasks and met with a CI to ask clarifying questions. I did a pretty simple nearest neighbor algorithm. This was the best coding class for sure, and it felt the most like work because of all the little details you need to work on. Don't sleep on this class. I didn't expect the writeup to take as long as it did from reading the requirements, but there is a template in course search you need to use to pass this class. I ended up with a 33 page pdf for task 2 (lots of screenshots and descriptions). \\n* **Computer Architecture – C952:** I was very intimidated by this class. I've heard it's hard, and I have practically zero prior knowledge. Tbh I procrastinated a lot on this as a result. However, all you really have to do is 1) Watch all of Lunsby's videos in course search, 2) Know all the terms in the Zybook highlighted in blue, 3) Know calculations covered by Lunsby. I went through the zybook along with Lunsby's videos at 1.75x speed. This is mostly to know what is important and what isn't. Then I went through the book from start to finish only to learn the vocab and redo exercises marked. It's easier to go through the vocab in the book imo because you can learn these things in context of each other. I had chatgpt open while I did this, asked it to explain things to me (\"explain it to me like I'm 5\" literally). There's also a 20 page study guide by Jim Ashe that is really good. However you do it, the important thing is to really understand how things work together. As I went through the vocab list, I would realize something is related to another thing and ask chatgpt to confirm. FWIW, I got exemplary on this test. This class was hard, but definitely one that is worthwhile to learn properly. The OA asks you questions in a way that requires you to understand the material, even if it's just at a high level. \\n* **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – C951:** This class was a real roller coaster. 3 tasks is daunting, but the first 2 are easy. The last one is really long, but it helps with the capstone. Task 1 and 2, I would suggest to just do the minimum and move on. It's not much AI/ML tbh, but I guess it's nice to get some experience working in different environments. For the video recordings, I would suggest jotting down some bullet points before recording. Don't skimp on task 3, and absolutely checkout the requirements for capstone before starting. Use [https://ashejim.github.io/BSCS/intro.html](https://ashejim.github.io/BSCS/intro.html) . The process of writing this paper, especially the outside source review section, really helped me learn the ML needed to do the capstone. I even used the strategies in the papers I reviewed to do my actual capstone. I almost took this class at SDC, and I'm glad I ended up doing it at WGU. \\n* **Operating Systems for Programmers – C191:** This was the final boss for me. I thought maybe I can reuse my Comp Arch strategy, but that wasn't really feasible with how many more topics were covered here. Shiggy's notes (discord) are probably the best sources for this class. I went through the individual chapters, then did my best to be very solid on the topics covered by the \"Know\" and \"More to know\" docs. I had chatgpt quiz me over and over on any topic I didn't really understand. I did hundreds of multiple choice questions that way. The OA is once again written in a way that requires you to understand how things work instead of just brute force memorizing vocab, so trying to understand things from different angles help a lot. \\n* **Computer Science Capstone – C964:** Did you plan ahead doing Intro to AI? If you did, congrats because this will be a cake walk for you. The proposal is easy, and I got mine back from Ashe in a few hours. The actual coding took me about 2 hours using Google Colab. I already had my strategy lined up between AI task 3 and the proposal (visualizations). The writing was pretty easy and I was able to finish \\~80% of it with paragraphs from AI task 3. I made sure to add comments in Colab to make things easier to read and understand. I also did all 3 of my visualizations there. All in all, it took just about a day. I really enjoyed this ML project. It was a subject I previously know nothing about, and I think this opened another door for me.\\n\\nGeneral tips\\n\\n* Pick easy classes to start with. Prove to your mentor that you can finish classes fast, and you will have a really easy time getting new classes unlocked. I had 2 PAs and 1 OA classes going at the same time for most of the program. \\n* Utilize CI appointments and Live Instructor Support. Obviously don't ask them things you can google, but if you get stuck, do yourself a favor and ask for help. If there's no LIS available, book CI appointments before you need them. Sometimes you have to wait up to a week to talk to them, so book early!\\n* GRAMMARLY: I write my papers in google docs and have the grammarly plugin installed (free with WGU). I ONLY correct the suggestions in \"correctness\" and nothing else. Never had a problem with professional communication or AI claims.\\n* Always check Course search, and pay special attention to files like \"templates\", \"FAQs\" and \"common fail points\"\\n   * For coding classes, go through common fail points thoroughly\\n   * For writing classes, there is always a template of some sort\\n* Pre-assessments: I only had 3 WGU OA classes, but my strategy was basically to take PAs only when I think I might be ready for the OA, because you can only see these questions for the first time once. They covered the same topics as the OAs, but questions may be asked in different ways.\\n* Join discord! Got so much good advice there.\\n\\nMore thoughts\\n\\n* Proctoring: I bought a cheap but new HP (16GB RAM) last year to use for testing only. No problems using it for SDC or ITIL, but I spent over 2 hours trying to get it to work with Guardian, it just won't. I then wiped an old macbook air (8GB RAM) and had no problems since. Best way to test whether your laptop and connection are good enough is to run the speed test on [https://speed.cloudflare.com/](https://speed.cloudflare.com/) Make sure \"Video chatting\" is at least \"Good\". RAM is not everything! Validated after learning more in Comp Arch and OS ;) \\n* The 3 WGU OAs I took were high quality in my opinion. The questions were well written and really required understanding of the material. \\n* The 2 certs I got were nice I guess, but I don't think they move the needle when it comes to looking for a SWE job.\\n* Use chatgpt to help you learn! Don't use it to cheat, you really only end up cheating yourself. It can be such a great tool for learning though. It got me through a lot of very dense topics.\\n\\n  \\nWas it worth it?\\n\\nFor less than $5k all in, getting this degree was absolutely worth it. I'm counting it as less with the $1000+ student discounts on random things I was able to get as well lol. Who knows with this job market, but I know I am a better engineer now with all this new knowledge. Most of the classes were relevant enough, and while the course materials may not be the best, most OAs and PAs are set up in a way that allow you to learn well if you want. \\n\\nI also have a degree from a B&M, and I have to say I really like this learning format. The depth you get is also far superior compared to any bootcamp out there. I'm not the most disciplined. I have a DSA coursera class from years ago that is perpetually stuck on chapter 1, but not having to pay another $4k was plenty motivation for me to get this done. \\n\\nIf you got to this point, thanks for reading my humongous brain dump. LMK what student discount I should take advantage of before graduating, and AMA!  \n",





                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Completed MSCSIA (Masters in Cybersecurity) in 40 days - it was challenging, not for everyone, many more would drop out, most would graduate in 1 year\\nI know, many hate to see such posts, but give me a chance. I'm in my mid-40s, have good IT background going back to high school (including programming in C, if anyone remembers that), have several small kids, work full time, and already have a Ph.D., as well as an undergrad from top universities (nationally and globally). \\n\\nSo going into this, I had many questions: WGU is radically different from anything I am used to - not making me comfortable.\\n\\nKnowing that CI's don't have any power and everything is evaluated anonymously, raised a lot of suspicions on my end.  \\n\\nReading horror stories about Examity didn't exactly inspire me. \\n\\nThe external camera requirement seemed like they were really going overboard. \\n\\n\"Will I have the time?\" That was a huge question, along with \"Do I really need this?\" These two questions underpinned everything for me. Basically, unless I could do this accredited and ranked degree in one semester, especially since I was paying for it myself, it was not worth it for me. \\n\\nHowever, I decided to take the plunge and transferred 3 classes due to already having CISM and CASP and other cyber certifications. I could have transferred 5 classes, but I decided to take CySA and Pentest while at WGU: it's cheaper that way plus I learn more. So I had to complete 7 remaining classes. I thought to myself: as long as I spend about 2 weeks per class, I should be able to do it in less that one semester/term. I need to complete everything before March ideally, since I have some major training for a different great program starting then.\\n\\nSo I start on Dec 1, but immediately get knocked down by an RSV from my youngest kid. As a result, the first 3 days are wasted laying in bed and being unable to concentrate. Very sad mood. So that took a lot of steam from under me, and now I got worried - Winter just started, and I was already down. \\n\\nPlus, now kids had a major change in schedule their coaches insisted on - they would now require more training time with their sports since they would be competing - which means I would be a part-time taxi service for them. So I had to read a lot of the WGU materials in the app, while sitting in the car with the heater on and off. As a note, I read all WGU materials, watched all videos, did half of all the labs, and read some of the books or chapters they assigned as optional reading. So I did not do what other accelerators do, which is go straight to the OA/PA. My goal was also to learn or refresh my skills somewhat, but certainly without exerting myself and without learning something completely from scratch (which is why I would not do a Masters in Computer Science, as I just don't want to learn some programming language - I know and understand enough of that, and won't be a programmer ever).\\n\\nOK, now started the first class, and followed the directions in one of the labs which said it required a paper, with screenshots. I did it, and proudly submitted to CI, only to find out that actually that lab in that class was not required at all - it was optional. So I wasted one (1) precious day of reading, following instructions, and writing a paper that was unnecessary. One day for me is significant - I'm a working adult. In one day I typically accomplish a lot. \"What a 'great' start!\" I am thinking to myself. \"Did you really need THIS? You don't have enough things in your life, you needed a 'challenge'?\"\\n\\nFinally, I got that class out of the way, and now felt better: I did it in less than the 2 weeks I allotted to myself per class. Now let's start the second and third classes - which require CySA exam and the Pentest exam. CySA was not hard for me since I already had more advanced CASP+, but Pentest+ was quite hard. I was really challenged, I thought it would be in the same league as Security+, but in reality, it's almost at the level of CASP+, and harder than CySA+. Thankfully, I prepared and refreshed my memory for a few days, and was familiar with Comptia exams. Otherwise, I don't know if I could have passed it on the first try. But getting vouchers, and then scheduling these exams takes time (I had to wait for 5 days for my CySA exam between scheduling it and actually taking it, for example, as Comptia was very busy in mid-December, before the holidays). After passing my exams I had to wait another 3 business days for exam results to be posted and classes to officially be completed. Without that, my mentor, who was not very experienced, was scared to allow me to register for more classes. The 2-days of weekends always had a negative effect as well, since it seemed like I submitted my papers or passed my Comptia exams on Friday's, thus having to wait longer (WGU allows 3 business days for grading, so in effect that could be 5 days with weekends).\\n\\nAnyhow, now I was done with 3 classes, and felt much better, but while waiting for these exam results, I started my 4th class, after convincing my mentor to allow me to take it - and submitted the paper that required me to use their incident response template. The \"originality report\" did not show the results of the check for over 24 hours, and I just went ahead and submitted it without it. The evaluator kicked it back, accusing me of plagiarism, since the checker ended up showing that the paper was 50% \"similar.\" I was still not familiar with all WGU processes, and it took me a while to understand how to navigate and read their evaluation reports, as well as \"similarity\" reports. I understood that the evaluator was totally inexperienced and forgot to exclude the text of the template from the checker - thus of course my paper was \"similar\". Then the names of the people, the names of the machine, the IP addresses -- all of this unavoidable and required information was also \"similar\" and evaluator forgot to exclude. \\n\\nSo now I have a crisis on my hands - I have a black mark on me and thanks to the incompetence of the anonymous evaluator I'm in deep trouble. I start remembering my initial hesitation with WGU precisely because of these anonymous evaluators and tell myself, \"See, you were right to think and predict this, but you didn't listen to yourself! Now go and waste your time dealing with this lemon!\" And dealing I did: I wrote protest emails to two officials at WGU, with a detailed analysis of what happened and what their evaluator did wrong. I called their assessment team and could barely contain my anger, explaining what happened. The lady on the line was very sympathetic to what happened, and felt like she understood the problem, but could only refer it to the anonymous evaluators, whose names and phones she doesn't have. I was very angry, and mentor was not helpful. But the next day an assistant dean wrote to me, said they investigated, agreed with me, accepted the paper, and removed the black mark from my name, clearing the record (yes, once you are accused of plagiarism they keep tabs on you). \\n\\nWhile I won, this wasted at least another working day from me, and caused a lot of stress I didn't need or deserve. As I mentioned earlier, I am very sensitive to even one wasted day. But now I completed 4 classes, and had just 3 more remaining, including Capstone. I'm thinking to myself - OK, I'm doing well, it looks like I can complete the degree in 30 days total.\\n\\nSo I started D485 -- and hit a brick wall. While I was trying to understand the requirements of this class' assignment, I asked to do D487, which I completed in a few days. But now all I had between me and the Capstone was D485. Calling IT help desk, or the student services, or mentor, or even CI, didn't help. Everything I found online was somewhat helpful, but not a lot, and nothing could bypass the need to learn Azure. Which I really didn't want to, since we use AWS, things change too quickly (case in point: Azure renamed Active Directory to Entra ID just a few months ago, while lab still shows AD), and I'm in the management. I paid my dues sort of speak, and don't need to be a sysadmin or cloudadmin Level II. I understand it enough, I really don't need to create RGs in Azure. But to pass this class it was essential, and I forced myself to watch everything there was. Since having work, kids, sports, etc., it took me 4 days to watch Pluralsight and read Azure's own training, and since the lab doesn't save the results and is slow, I had to go in, and redo settings 5-6 times.   \\n\\n\\nAbout CI's: the CI tried to be helpful, with tips and cohort recordings (and same is true of all other classes, where CI's try to be helpful, but are really limited on what they can do. Indeed, they are probably as helpful as any professor in any online program in most universities). So I really liked the CIs, but they are severely limited. That's something WGU must change in the future if it really wants to become a Top 50 university.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well. But I was able to start Capstone basically after NY, it took them 1 day to approve Task 1, then I submitted Task 2, and it was kicked back, since I didn't understand - as it's not really in the requirements - that I have to write as if my company has been hacked, i.e., there was some kind of a cyberincident. That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day.   \\n\\n\\nOf course, Christmas and New Year really slowed me down as well.

That was a big change, so had to redo a lot of text, and resubmit. After 3 days they approved it, and I immediately submitted Task 3, which was approved the next day. It took mentor 2 days to submit paperwork for graduation.  \\n\\n\\nSo the end result: I am glad I took the plunge, and did this quickly and on budget. It was definitely not easy, had I been 20-something, it would have taken me the full 6 months, even though I was sharper, faster, and had boundless energy back then. I'm slower, and can't concentrate anymore, but I'm also smarter, more focused, methodical, and disciplined (not much social life helps). It was definitely worth it for me because of this, and thank you to WGU for creating and maintaining a regionally accredited degree that's ranked high and keeps improving, with strict anti-plagiarism measures and external cameras to nip critics in the bud and maintain the value of the degree. I say this despite being a victim of the unprofessionalism of one particular overzealous evaluator, or having many other things I could criticize. This program is on par with programs at most other universities (except the most select).   \\n\\n\\nThus, I did it in 40 days, would have done it in 30 days, and if I knew WGU processes and was luckier, then maybe even in 20 days. **But** I also know that less than 1% can complete a degree quickly, and for every such accelerator there are 10 who drop out, and 90% who finish on regular schedule. It was a challenging program - Capstone was not easy but super fun nevertheless (that's the geek in me), D485 I will remember forever (I hated it, but hugely respect it and will always tell this story to my kids), and other classes that required you to draw network diagrams or do Examity proctored exams, made it very challenging, since had to learn new skills or refresh long-forgotten Visio skills, and had very little direction and explanation from WGU. Yet there was no need for busywork, no unnecessary stretching of the program or overloading the student with 10 books per class. So it's perfect for a working professional, who doesn't have the time of the 20-something full-time student (or even part-time student -- you guys, if you think you are \"busy\", wait until you marry, have kids, senior position at work, and other social obligations).   \\n\\n\\nI would love for WGU to make a few improvements, so I could take another degree or two from it:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n1) give CI's more power, and make them assistant professors at least. Let them publish research. This will improve rankings. And allow students to pair up with professors to publish research jointly, based on the capstone project.\\n\\n2) anonymous evaluators are not cool. I get the perceived need for that, but WGU should not be CIA.\\n\\n3) update the curriculum! (The OSI model is ridiculous, for example, and has always been controversial. It is unnecessary when there is a TCP/IP model which is actually used. Where is anything on blockchains? Crypto? Adversarial AI/ML? Post-quantum cryptography? SD-WANs?) Yes, it's not bad compared to other universities, but compare yourselves to Georgia Tech, MIT, Johns Hopkins, etc. This will improve the ranking further.\\n\\n4) require papers for every class. Even if these classes have Comptia exams.\\n\\n5) clarify all requirements and put them all in one document. Please don't say \"they already are.\" No, they are not. We can test it - WGU officials in charge should write a paper, and submit to me, and see what will happen.\\n\\n6) Mentors have too much power at the expense of the students. A lot of WGU students are working adults. We should not need to ask permission to register for classes. I should be able to start 4 classes at once if I want. It's my risk, my transcript, my life. And I paid for it already. \\n\\n7) Gain more and better accreditations for IT, Business, and other colleges and programs. \\n\\n8) Allow students to enroll in two programs at once - for example, IT and nursing. Not dual degree, but keep them as two separate programs, two separate degrees. Just allow them to be taken concurrently, not \"finish and graduate from one, and only then start the second one\". Again, we are adults, we know what we want and what we can. Every month and every day matters for us. If I finish/graduate on September 6, it means I can only start my studies in a new program at WGU on November 1. But if I would have been able to graduate by September 5, I could start on October 1. Just one day, and such a huge effect. \\n\\n9) Improve the orientation class. Right now it's very long and cumbersome. Make it shorter, and have a clear \"quick start\" guide that has everything we need on it. Right now everything is clunky, orientation is a waste of time, and for some reason it pollutes our transcripts, by being listed on it as a zero-credit class. Totally unnecessary to include zero credit, non-academic \"course\" which is not a course on it. \\n\\nSo recruiters and HR reading this: this is a very legit degree, that's more challenging than most others, yet can be had in a matter of weeks, not a year like others. Graduates of this program actually learn smth, and can do things, unlike most graduates of other programs who learn theory and would quickly forget or get confused within weeks of graduation. \\n\\nThank you all, this forum and its members have been great.\\n\\n&#x200B;  \n",

                                                    How I Completed the WGU MBA in One Term While Working Full-Time\\nHello folks!!\\n\\nI completed the WGU MBA in one term, just five months while working full-time, and here’s precisely what I did. If you’re considering starting the program or are already enrolled and wondering how to move forward without burning out, this should help. I’ve listed the key resources and tips I used below so you can jump right into what works.\\n\\n[My Overview Video of the Entire Program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_pH7zEMrDs)\\n\\nWGU uses a **competency-based model**, which means you move through the courses by showing that you understand the material, either through writing papers or passing exams. There are no weekly classes or fixed schedules. You set your pace. Some people finish in six months. Others take a year or two. It depends on how much time you can realistically commit.\\n\\nThe coursework ranges from relatively easy to genuinely challenging, especially in areas such as accounting and statistics. But there’s no fluff. Every course has a clear structure, and if you follow the rubrics and use the resources, you can get through it. The biggest challenge isn’t the content—it’s staying focused and pushing yourself to keep going.\\n\\nThis program isn’t for everyone. If you prefer a more structured, traditional classroom environment, it might not be the best fit. But if you want something flexible that doesn’t waste your time, and you’re ready to put in the effort, the **WGU MBA** can be a solid option.\\n\\n# ORA1: Orientation\\n\\nWhat it takes to pass: One performance assessment (study plan + reflection) This is just a basic intro course to help you create a weekly study plan and understand the WGU format.

Use every tool at your disposal: Grammarly, APA templates, your instructors, and the community. If you stay focused and methodical, you can absolutely finish in one term, or two if you need more space. But also, if it takes you two-years that is totally cool!\\n\\nYOU GOT THIS, you 100% can do this. All it takes is time and effort. If you can put in several hours most days, you can do this in one-term. Remember, you can extend one course (the capstone) for a total of seven months.\\n\\n100% Free, no signin Study Guide: [The (Unofficial) MBA Study Guide for WGU](https://adamvaluckas.com/the-unofficial-mba-study-guide-for-wgu)\\n\\nMy YouTube channel with WGU MBA videos: [https://www.youtube.com/@AdamValuckas](https://www.youtube.com/@AdamValuckas)\\n\\nConnect with me on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaluckas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamvaluckas)  \n",



                                                                                                                                                                              Confetti and tips\\nI just got my confetti!  The wait between filling out the graduation application and getting the confetti felt like the longest wait in this course (5 days). I started 1/1/25, so this took me just over three months.  Honestly, it could have been quicker, but I work full-time, have a house, wife, 2 young kids with activities and birthdays, dog died…etc.\\n\\nI wanted to give everyone here some insights and tell you about my experience to hopefully answer some of questions of people who are considering this program.  I should start with a little about me because everyone has their own path and learning style so YMMV (Your Mileage May Vary).\\n\\nI am just into my 40’s, I completed my Associate’s from a local community college in 2018, and I my bachelor's degree last year (2024) from Charter Oak State College.  Despite my higher education coming largely later in life, I’m also the guy that took calculus because it was interesting and Coursera’s Google Data Analytics certificate for fun.  So later when I say, C207 was actually fun for me, now you know why.\\n\\nI am a paramedic by trade, but I’m in management now.  One important aspect of my job is writing detailed and professional investigation reports about employee and emergency incidents.  This helped greatly in all of my college writing.  One thing I really appreciate about WGU is that the papers were very content driven as opposed to feeling like a test on how well I use APA format.\\n\\nWith all of that said, your path is your own.  In the words of a popular song from around the time I graduated high school, “The race is long and, in the end, it’s only with yourself.”\\n\\nBefore I move on to talking about general tips and class specifics, I do want to address one item: WGU is awesome.  I don’t know what the qualifications are of calling it a “degree mill” and I really don’t care.  Unless it is a top 7 MBA school (Yale, Harvard…) then it just doesn’t matter which school you get your MBA from as long as it’s accredited.  For those who ask “What do you really retain when you are going that quickly?”  The answer is “A lot!”  This is very applicable to my career and goals.  I’d also tell them that I remember almost nothing from my Art History class that was a full 15-week semester in-person class.  The people who have some experience can move quickly, the people who don’t have incredible resources to succeed.  I explained it this way to someone: If your boss found out that you completed a project to full industry specifications ahead of schedule and under budget, how valuable did you just make yourself?\\n\\nTo be fair, there are some negatives.  Despite my earlier comment about the papers, I don’t feel the papers are as rigorous as I would have expected for a Master’s program.  They felt much more like writing essay answers on a test than a cohesive, well supported, college-level paper.  Also, it happened twice where I got a paper returned for revision a second time for something that passed successfully on the first submission and wasn’t changed.  Typically, it was the “professional communication” item because the evaluator just ran it through Grammarly and decided there were too many “correctness” errors. \\n\\n**General Tips and resources:**  \\n  \\nThe “Course Search” link in every course is available before you start any course as are the Pre-Assessment Quizzes.  This was great for me in late December before my classes started and while waiting for paper submissions to be evaluated.  I would open the next course and have full access to any recorded lectures and task videos.  It allowed me to work ahead when I could.  Also, if I felt comfortable, I was even able to take the PA’s prior to the class opening.\\n\\nI found Studuco to be very helpful.  There are condensed study guides to several classes that I would review before an OA.  Also, there were times when the rubric wasn’t very clear on exactly what was expected in the paper.  I found it very useful to see how others tackled some sections of their work.\\n\\nI took all of the PA’s twice to ensure that I started to grasp the material I missed and that the overall score was improving.  In some of the classes, there were also end of chapter quizzes that I could take and often would.\\n\\nChatGPT.  I never have AI write for me, it’s against my own personal ethical code, but it is still an amazing resource in other ways.  It can recommend scholarly sources, it can evaluate your paper against a rubric, it can clarify some concepts the course material isn’t clear on, and it can further explain why one answer is the correct one on the Pre Assessment questions. \\n\\nEveryone asks if the PAs and OAs are similar and yes, they are, for all courses.  In general, I found there to be three variations. \\n\\n1. The questions are exactly the same (rarely).\\n\\n2. They utilize different numbers or data.  This also applies to the non-math classes.  It would be along the lines of the PA asking which law was violated in this scenario vs the OA giving you a different scenario and therefore needing a different correct answer.  \\n\\n3. The OA questions are reflections of PA questions.  For example, the PA might ask: You have 10 total items in your shopping cart, 5 are apples, the others are oranges, how many oranges do you have?  Whereas the OA will ask: You have 10 total items in your shopping cart, 5 are oranges, the others are apples, how many apples do you have?  This also applies to the non-math courses as well.\\n\\n**Course Specifics:**\\n\\nC200 – Easy class.  Two papers, both about 10 pages including title and reference page.  I did have the first paper returned for revision because I just straight up missed a section on the assignment / rubric.  Resubmitted and passed without issue.  My only advice for this class is when you are choosing the leadership style to discuss, take a quick look over the leadership style course materials to ensure there is enough material to work with on the compare / contrast areas. (1/1/2025 – 1/7/2025)\\n\\nC202 – Easy class as well.  I am very familiar with HR practices and law because it was a fairly extensive class in my bachelor's degree and I work with HR very closely in my position.  This was my first OA.  I took the PA for this course in late December before my classes officially began in January.  I used some of the condensed study guides on Studuco before taking the OA and had an exemplary pass. (1/1/2025 – 1/3/2025)\\n\\nC204 – Easy class.  Two assignments, one which involved a recorded presentation.  I don’t feel that I did a good job speaking in the presentation but passed anyways.  I recorded myself right on power point and then uploaded it to Panopto to get a submission link.  Studuco helped here because I was confused about how much I needed to invent possible solutions and how thoroughly I needed to support their benefit.  I would just advise you on these to keep it simple.  Two passes, no revisions. (1/1/2025 – 1/12/2025)\\n\\nC212 – Now this class was completely new for me.  At no point in my professional or educational career have I come across marketing.  I started by reading the material and watching what videos I could.  Eventually, I decided it was better to just start writing and learn as I go rather than learn the material, then write.  This actually worked out pretty well for me.  I developed my concept and product; I wrote the introduction and then learned each section as I was writing it.  I did have to look at Studuco a few times to understand how others were approaching some of the tasks.  Obviously, I needed to customize my response and approach for my product, but seeing what others had done helped greatly.  This was a long paper, passed first time. (1/12/2025 – 1/20/2025)\\n\\nC206 – I choose to do this class before the math / accounting classes because I wanted to group my classes with papers vs my classes with OAs.  This was a relatively easy class, but I found the papers to be annoying and relatively uninteresting.  The course videos were a wonderful resource on these and my primary method of learning and writing for the paper.  I did get a revision on the second task of three because the ethical dilemma I chose was about terminally ill kids and defective toys.  Apparently, this was regarded more as a business decision than a personal ethical dilemma.  I still call BS on that, but whatever, I ended up changing it to a coworker stealing money and passed task 2.  On task one, I needed a revision on further defining the difference of two ethical perspectives.  I found the evaluator’s comments to be a little unclear.  I gave ChatGPT my paper, the assignment, the rubric and the evaluators comments to help me understand where my paper was lacking.  The problem was much clearer after that.  I used the course material and revised my work.  Passed on the second revision.  (1/20/2025 – 02/02/2025.  Unfortunately, my 10-year-old German Shepherd died in during this period, which for obvious reasons slowed my progress down).\\n\\nC213 – Medium difficultly class.  I felt ready for this class because of my affinity for math and other comments… This class had very little to do with me doing math.  It was mostly a naming convention and memorization course, you have to know how money is categorized in each statement.  A calculator was useful for some intermediary calculations, but any calculator would have worked.  This was the only OA I recommend having a whiteboard.  For this class, I mostly watched the videos in the course search twice and at 2x speed.  Exemplary pass.  (2/2/2025 – 2/12/2025)\\n\\nC214 – I enjoyed this class.  It was more focused on the business / financing side rather than the exact accounting side.  I do believe taking this class back-to-back with C213 was beneficial.  Again, I watched the videos under course search twice at 2x speed.  If you know excel, you’ll have no issues.  I actually really like the format of the PA and OA and I didn’t need the business calculator.  Exemplary pass.  (2/12/2025 – 02/22/2025)\\n\\nC207 – The class everyone fears / hates.  I actually had fun in this course.  I have an affinity for data analytics and found the material interesting.  The course layout does need some help, but the course search videos were very helpful.  Again, watched those twice on 2x speed.  I took the OA pretty quickly and passed, the essays though gave me a little trouble.  This was one of those courses that one of my papers got returned twice.  The paper required some clarity on some of my answers.  I found the feedback to be valid and was able to revise and resubmit.  It got returned again for things that I didn’t change and weren’t an issue on the first submission.  This was very frustrating.  The second paper wasn’t an issue and passed first time.  ChatGPT was helpful in the areas that the text and materials didn’t explain well, such as the differentiation of concepts like incidence, prevalence, etc.  (2/22/2025 – 3/3/2025).\\n\\nC215 – My current job title is Operations Manager.  This class was a prime example of the power of competency-based education.  I watched the videos again at 2x speed.  There were some supply chain concepts I wasn’t familiar with, but overall, this class was my bread and butter.  Exemplary pass on the OA (3/3/2025 – 3/6/2025).\\n\\nC211 – This class was difficult.  It wasn’t the concepts as much as the extreme narrow margin of only 50ish questions on the OA.  I enjoyed the material, but it wasn’t laid out well.  The videos were boring and didn’t cover as much material as I would have preferred in relation to the OA / PA.  I found some study guides on Studuco which were very helpful.  I passed the OA on the first try, but it wasn’t by comfortable margin.  (3/6/2025 – 3/10/2025)\\n\\nC216 – This capstone really slowed me down.  The simulation was fun, but there was a lot more to it than I expected.  There were 3 papers required in this course, one of which comes with a presentation you give on the first 3 quarters of your company.  I watched a couple YouTube videos of other presentations which gave me a sense of how deeply I needed to go into certain topics and how much information to put on each slide.  I recorded myself in power point again and uploaded it to Panopto to get a link for submission.  The first task was returned because one of my financial decisions was actually an investing decision – fair enough.  I didn’t have to redo the entire presentation, I just needed to add a single slide (without recording) and presentation notes just for that one slide.  By the way, I was told that I needed to submit this paper / presentation and then immediately press submit on the simulation.  I was told that it needed to be done in this order because otherwise I would lose access to the information I needed for the presentation, and I would be locked out until my paper passed.  I’m not sure if this was a fluke or a change in the program, but I wasn’t able to submit my Q4 until the paper passed.  I wasn’t able to move on, but I could go back and make all sorts of changes if I wanted.  I was worried that something was wrong, and I was going to have to contact IT, but after my paper passed, I was able to finally submit Q4 in the simulation and everything was fine. \\n\\nThe second paper and third paper were submitted within hours of each other.  Both needed revisions.  The third paper needed specifics on how past concepts helped me in the simulation - fair and easily corrected, passed on the second attempt.  The second paper was another frustrating one.  The first revision needed some clarity on the impact of my actions, and I needed to actually spell out the math on the earnings per share.  Again, this was fair and easily corrected.  This attempt was again returned for professional communication which really irritated me because that wasn’t a problem in the first submission.  The evaluator even specified that there were too many errors on the “correctness” area on Grammarly.  Fine. I ran it through Grammarly and made the corrections, some of which I found to be more stylization preferences than actual corrections.  Resubmitted and passed.  (3/10/2025 – 4/1/2025). \\n\\nAll-in-all, this was an incredible experience.  I am truly grateful for this style of learning and college.  WGU allowed me to work at my own pace, leverage my skills and experience to learn and progress at a speed I’m comfortable with.  Seeing my progress and hearing the good things I had to say about WGU, wife is actually starting soon because she gets a contractual raise for having a second masters.  I wish everyone here all the best and thank you guys for the amazing advice and community on r/WGU_MBA  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Kevin Pineapple's B.S. IT Review\\nHey everyone!\\n\\nFollowing in the footsteps of many others--notably u/jwawa and u/wotanwolf, I'd like to offer my writeup on the BS IT program through WGU, and how I completed those classes. I completed it within 1 term, only transferring in 21 credits from completion of certs prior to my start at WGU.  A little background about me: I work full-time as the sole IT analyst for a major healthcare company in their downtown office full-time M-F. Most of my time during waking hours was either work, study, or both permitting downtime.\\n\\nI also want to mention this: There have been several courses where I failed the OA, and had to retake it. That is not because the course itself was difficult, but rather I was under prepared and didn't take the time to slow down and comprehend it properly. \\n\\nI highly recommend both jwawa's and wotan's guide, as they were my motivators to succeed:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/88nnpw/jwawas\\_it\\_course\\_notes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/88nnpw/jwawas_it_course_notes/) (jwawa), [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/8izjot/wotans\\_bs\\_it\\_review/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/8izjot/wotans_bs_it_review/) (wotanwolf)\\n\\nIn addition to their wonderful guides, I also used an excel spreadsheet made by  [u/berge472](https://www.reddit.com/user/berge472/)  located here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/62lb59/course\\_progress\\_tracker/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/62lb59/course_progress_tracker/); I used this as a means of motivating myself over time, and to show how far I've come.\\n\\nStart date: 5/1/2020 | End Date: 9/25/2020\\n\\n**My Courses**\\n\\n* **Introduction to IT (c182) - 05/01 - 05/02**:  \"A mile wide and an inch deep\" should be the motto for this class. If you have sufficient knowledge on computer hardware and best practices you can easily complete this in a day. Study-wise, I only went through the Pre-Assessment once, then went straight to the OA.\\n* **Critical Thinking and Logic (c168) - 05/05 - 05/05**: Another fairly easy class, this goes over the general concepts of critical thinking, and does not go any further. I took the pre-assessment to see where I stood, and based off what I was weak in (was a few sections), I then read the course material. Afterwards I retook the PA, got a good score and then took the OA.\\n* **Introduction to Communication (c464) - 05/03 - 05/06**: Fairly similar to c168 in terms of the course just generalizing concepts of communication, and the types of communicators. This class is the only one of it's kind (for my program) to require a video PA, in addition to the OA. I completed the OA before performing the PA which is split into 2 tasks: the first is a paper report on an academic topic of your choice, and the second task is a video recording going over that paper. Panopto was the system used to record myself. My advice here is to have 2 screens: 1 with a script and the other showing your video recording.\\n* **Applied Probability and Statistics (c955) - 05/06 - 05/10**: This course wasn't too bad, I worked off of the areas I was weak in based off of the PA using the UCertify practice tests, and re-took the PA again and got a higher score. The PA and OA align closely together.  For this and the other 2 math classes I solely used my Casio FX-CG50 (great calculator!)\\n* **Applied Algebra (c957) - 05/11 - 05/12:** This course is alot easier if you're coming right out of c955 as you carry over some of the fundamentals easily. I used the practice exams in UCertify and took the PA before going for the OA. Fairly straight forward.\\n* **Finite Mathematics (c277) - 05/13 - 05/16:** Boy do I really hate Truth Tables. Nothing I could find help cement the theory of it until I came across this beautiful person on YouTube that explained it for me to finally understand it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMC-ttjhwM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRMC-ttjhwM)\\n* **Natural Science Lab (c683) - 05/19 - 05/19:** OK this is hilariously easy. You need to write on a natural science experiment and observe the changes made introduced by your original hypothesis. An example is comparing the melting rate of ice between water, oil, and salt water. Again, very very easy.\\n* **English Composition II (c456) - 05/19 - 05/21:**  English is my favorite course of study, and I already had prior experience in writing literature papers so this went by easier for me. This course only has 2 PA's; The first task is to create an thesis statement and a bibliography using 8-10 sources in APA format. I used [https://scholar.google.com/](https://scholar.google.com/) to locate my articles, and [https://www.citationmachine.net/apa/cite-a-website](https://www.citationmachine.net/apa/cite-a-website) to quickly format my source websites into APA format, then paste them into Word. The 2nd task is the actual paper regarding your argument. At this point you're just reiterating what you stated from the 1st paper.\\n* **Integrated Physical Sciences (c165) - 05/22 - 05/25:** This is the first (of many) OA that I failed, mostly attributed to my own hubris and believing I was ready when I really wasn't.  For my 2nd attempt I went through the course material and did the knowledge checks, quizzes, and used the following Quizlet in Learn mode to make sure I was drilling it down: [https://quizlet.com/376991990/integrated-physical-science-c165-wgu-flash-cards/](https://quizlet.com/376991990/integrated-physical-science-c165-wgu-flash-cards/)\\n* **American Politics and the US Constitution (c963) - 05/26 - 05/30:** I disliked the course material, was too dry for me to stay focused and keep my ADHD in check, so I discovered this amazing series called CrashCourse, that had a video playlist going over U.S. Government and Politics ([https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H))--best of all it was engaging! Highly recommend. This, in addition to the PA was my sole source of preparing for  the OA.\\n* **Introduction to Humanities (c100) - 06/01 - 06/02**: This course was fairly easy. The OA is slightly more difficult than the PA (pre-assessment) but still links up properly in what it's asking of you. It focuses heavily on the major themes throughout history and the figures in them. Know this, in addition to works of art and buildings and you'll be golden. The PA (Performance) is a report on a work of art or figure from a pre-determined list. \\*STRONG HINT\\* The classical period is well-documented ;)\\n* **Technical Communication (c768) - 06/03 - 06/04:** This is the little brother to the Capstone, as it contains 2 PA's: The first task is to write up a request for proposal (RFP) for a company that implements a solution using technology. The second task is to then actually create the proposal itself. The rubric is your friend with this paper. Again, I used Google Scholar for my sources, and the citation machine website for APA formatting.\\n* **Emerging Technologies (c850) - 06/04 - 06/04:** While I was waiting for my PA's in c768 to finish evaluating I started on this class. Compared to the previous class, this is a cake walk. This has 1 PA in which you propose (see a pattern?) an emerging technology as a solution to a fictional organization. Use the case study attached in the course to determine your method of proposal as there's many solutions to choose from based on the case study.\\n* **Cloud Foundations (c849) 06/8 - 06/10:** The first of many certifications.  UCertify was my only source of study material as this is the general concepts of cloud networking. CompTIA likes to make all their foundational certs a mile wide but an inch deep. Know the fundamentals and services (Iaas, SaaS, PaaS), the types of cloud (Private, Public, Hybrid, Community), and you'll be golden.\\n* **Data Management - Foundations (c175) 06/14 - 06/16:** I hated reading about databases then, and I still do now.  I highly advise you to avoid UCertiy and utilize the videos from LinkedIn Learning, much easily digestible. You can also watch Caleb Curry on YouTube ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0j0QN2b57M&list=PL\\_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0j0QN2b57M&list=PL_c9BZzLwBRK0Pc28IdvPQizD2mJlgoID)) and still come out fine.\\n* **Data Management - Applications (c170) 06/17 - 06/20:** Remember how I mentioned my dislike for databases? Well it showed here. I failed both of the OA's on the first go.  My 2nd attempt I used UCertify, and drilled home the labs in the UCertify material. The labs in the material is the *exact* same as the Lab OA, save some name changes. I cannot stress this enough. The multiple choice OA was tough, but as long as you do the quizzes in UCertify you should be fine.\\n* **Spreadsheets (c268) - 06/22 - 06/23:** Watch this [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6Ppltu3wbU&feature=youtu.be) video and enjoy that easy 100%. The OA is the exact (exact) same as the PA. Did I mention it's eerily similar?\\n* **Ethics in Technology (c961) - 06/24 - 06/25:** This class boils down to \"Is this legal or ethical?\". Once you understand the distinction between the two and go through the PA, the OA will be  an easy one.\\n* **Information Systems Management (c724) - 06/26 - 06/27:** Similar to the above class, only it goes into the business side of IT. The PA, and UCertify quizzes are your friends.\\n* **Scripting and Programming - Foundations (c173) - 06/29 - 06/30:** If you have any fundamental knowledge of scripting, this class can be done within 1 day. The UCertify practice test is a great tool to use to nail down some of the concepts in relation to programming.\\n* **Web Development Foundations (c779) 07/01 - 07/09:** I failed the OA on the first go due to my lack of preparedness. On my 2nd attempt, I solely used the practice tests in UCertify and read through any chapters where I had gaps in knowledge.\\n* **Network and Security - Applications (c178) 07/13 - 07/25:** This course is for the Security+ exam. For almost all of the certification exams I used sources outside of WGU. For this course, I used [Professor Messer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG49S3nxzAnnVhoAaL4B6aMFDQ8_gdxAy) and several practice tests that you can find online for free.\\n* **Business of IT - Applications (c846) - 07/27 - 08/01:** This is for the ITILv4 certification. I used the official ITILv4 app ([Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.tso.itilfourfoundation&hl=en_US)| [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/official-itil-4-foundation-app/id1446263720)) in order to  pass this one.\\n* **User Interface Design (c773) - 08/04 - 08/08:** This course is for the CIW - User Interface Designer certification exam. I followed [jwawa's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/7wn4l5/c773_user_interface_design_completed_wstudy_notes/) down to the end and was able to pass on my 1st attempt.\\n* **Organizational Behavior and Leadership (c484) - 08/10 - 08/11:**  If you have some experience and/or knowledge of how a company functions, this should be easy. I took the PA and used it as my source to improve in the areas needed. PA is somewhat similar to the OA. I encourage you to at least read a few chapters (it's dry unfortunately).\\n* **Web Development Applications (c777) - 08/12 - 08/16:** Basic HTML knowledge is sufficient enough to pass. If you're new to HTML, use the UCertify material and definitely use the practice exam mastery mode to hone it in.\\n* **Business of IT - Project Management (c176)  -  08/17 - 08/27:** This course is for the CompTIA Project+ certification. I followed along to [jwawa's guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/7yofa3/c176_project_management_completed_wstudy_notes/) for this course and was able to pass without an issue.\\n* **Principles of Management (c483) - 08/31 - 09/01:** Fairly easy course, just go through the competency videos located in Course Tips and you'll be golden.\\n* **Linux Foundations (c851) - 09/02 - 09/19:** I underestimated this course and failed on the first attempt by 1 question.  On my 2nd attempt, I had a VM instance of Ubuntu ready, and followed along to everything (and I mean everything) that Sean Powell did in the UCertify videos. I also read chapters I struggled in and did the practice tests, and was able to pass on my 2nd attempt.\\n* **IT Capstone (c769) - 09/21 - 09/24:** I honestly am not sure how I pulled this one off. I already had an idea in mind for my capstone back when I first enrolled into WGU as I had recently completed a project at work that fit this course perfectly. The first task is simply getting the topic approved by your mentor and submitting it. Task 2 is the proposal for the topic, and task 3 is the status-report after the project was completed. Task 2 took the longest out of the 3, and surprisingly task 3 was easy since you're cutting a lot of your work from 2 -> 3. I made sure to look at the Capstone Model and Excellence Archives as a reference for those that completed it in how they presented their reports.\\n\\nWGU has been a great experience for me, and even now writing this out feels like a dream! There were days where I didn't want to keep going and take a day off, but I held true to my goal of getting it done; Even when I failed my OA's, I became more determined to succeed. My schedule has been roughly the same since I enrolled: I work 7:30 AM - 5 PM M - F, but wake up as early as 4 AM to get a head start on some course work.\\n\\nThe only advice I can give is to breathe. There are going to be moments where you feel like you can't go on anymore, but I promise you, you can get to the other side and get that degree!\\n\\nOnce again I want to thank u/wotanwolf and u/jwawa from the bottom of my heart: You guys inspired me to return to school, and to finish it within 1 term. Thank you guys.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Transferring in 63.11% of my BSCS - A Review / Guide to Sophia, Straighterline, and study.com\\nI’m beginning my BS Computer Science next month, in April 2023.  I work full time study part-time.  I began working on third-party courses in September 2022 so I could transfer in as many credits as possible in order to minimize the number of terms needed at WGU.  I got my transfer credit evaluation back a couple days ago, and since I transferred in a *lot* of credits from third-party sites (namely study.com, Straighterline, and Sophia).  Here is the master list of every course I’ve taken between September and now, reviews and thoughts on each, how they transfer into WGU, and how much it all cost me.\\n\\nBut first, a little more context / background about me: I’m American and live in the US.  I have a BA in art history - spent about ⅞ semesters of this degree planning on going on to law school afterward and becoming an attorney, then spent my last semester abroad and ultimately decided “Oh wait! I actually *don’t* want all that debt! And I want to live abroad! And the thought of taking the bar makes me feel physically ill!” I don’t have any formal IT/tech experience, but I’ve always been “into” computers in my free time growing up so IT/tech/software was never completely out of the question, and before anyone says it, for me it’s not some desperate grab for money after ending up with a BA in art history.  I don’t have any debt from said BA as I was awarded a full ride (hence my growing distaste at the thought of taking on debt for law the closer and closer to that time I got), and I landed a great job at a regional food bank.  Definitely have no regrets (apart from not starting out as a CS/ArtHistory double major to begin with (and spending a year studying French instead of using that time to get better at Spanish)) as art history not only made life have so much more beauty and meaning than before, it’s just not what I want to do forever.\\n\\nMy job paid well enough for me to pay for all these third-party credits “as I go,” and I should be able to do the same with my WGU term(s).  I think I’ve saved myself at least a full year’s worth of WGU classes with these credits though, and saved several thousand dollars at the same time.  I **highly** recommend transferring in as many credits as you possibly can.  The BSCS has a **lot** of opportunities to transfer credits in, which means more time to study more relevant material on your own.  Anyways, without further ado, here’s what I’ve worked on the last few months:\\n\\n**Executive Summary**\\n\\nTotal number of credits transferred in:\\n\\n* 3 credits from Sophia\\n* 3 credits from Straighterline\\n* 8 credits from study.com\\n* 10 credits from my BA\\n\\nTotal cost:\\n\\n* $99 at Sophia\\n* \\~$400 at Straighterline\\n* \\~$800 at study.com\\n\\n**Sophia**\\n\\nJust a quick note about this platform.  When you sign up, you’re given the option to select from a variety of subscription options.  I went for the one month / $99 one (for people who “want to work quickly through one or two courses”), and I’d planned on only completing two courses because I read that as though there’d be a cap on the number of courses you could take in that month.  There’s not actually a limit - you can just have up to 2 courses active at one time, but if you can finish courses in a matter of hours then this is not a barrier at all.  Go for this cheapest option, and grind out as many as you can / need.  No exams are proctored, and they’re all (officially) open-book.  Don’t waste your time and money using this platform for more than 1-2 months.\\n\\n\\*\\*You can see how credits transfer from Sophia to WGU [here](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Transfer.aspx?iid=1385&institution=Sophia%20Learning%20LLC)\\n\\n*Web Development Fundamentals*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 0/10\\n* Time to complete: <1 day\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Almost embarrassingly easy, actually.  There are just 3 units, each with a few required quizzes and a very slightly larger unit quiz.  After that there was one “final” which was only like 20 questions.  That was the entire course: no actual web development required.  I’ve completed FreeCodeCamp’s responsive web design class which is more of what I would imagine an introductory web dev course should be like, but Sophia was easy credit I guess.  Finished this one in a couple hours, and it only took that long because it can get tedious grinding out multiple choice quizzes.\\n\\n*Principles of Management*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 0/10\\n* Time to complete: <1 day\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Slightly more involved than web dev fundamentals, but still really easy.  Thank God I wasn’t actually trying to *learn* anything from Sophia or I would’ve definitely felt like I got ripped off.  (Granted, there is actually a lot of material to read and comb through, but it’s not required to do well on the quizzes, which is what I was here for.)  Great for the super easy and cheap credit, but you get what you paid for.  This class had 4 units instead of just 3, and it required a presentation at the end.  Presentation is super easy, you just have to make a PowerPoint and they even give you a template of what exactly to put on each slide.\\n\\n*Project Management*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 0/10\\n* Time to complete: <1 day\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Once again, almost too easy.  About on par with Principles of Management, minus the PowerPoint.  If WGU’s project management course (and by extension, the CompTIA Project+ certification) are something you’re actually interested in learning, don’t take it at Sophia.\\n\\n**Straighterline**\\n\\nThis platform is pricier than Sophia, and I just took courses here because I kept seeing it’s the best (read: easiest) platform to take calculus on.  The Intro to Programming in C++ course was actually really good, and calculus was in fact not too painless, so I’d recommend this platform just for those courses.  Taking anything else isn’t necessarily worth the cost, as Sophia is the cheapest option as you’re billed monthly, and study.com is a comparable price per course but minus the monthly subscription.  Straighterline charges a $99/month subscription fee plus you have to purchase each individual course, so it’s the most expensive option of these three but of course it could be worth it for some courses.\\n\\n\\*\\*You can see how credits transfer from Straighterline to WGU [here](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Transfer.aspx?iid=130&institution=Straighterline)\\n\\n*Intro to IT*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 4/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * Not a bad course actually.  There’s enough content to challenge you if you’re actually looking to learn (in this case, I was), and enough unit quizzes to ace to give you a lot of padding when taking the proctored final.  No project or anything, just 8 unit tests and a final exam.\\n\\n*Calculus I*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 5/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~1 week\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * This is the primary reason I bought into this platform: for cheap and easy calculus credit.  I was decent at math *in high school*, but there’re about 6 years and a liberal arts degree between then and now, so you can probably imagine most of that decency has been lost.  And frankly I don’t have the time nor the desire to re-teach myself math from algebra I on upward, so I followed Reddit’s advice and got a good calculator, a TI-Nspire CX II CAS (*very* cheaply on an eBay auction), learned how to use it well, and went to work.  Be careful using CAS calculators at WGU though as they’re against school policy.  The only remaining “math” class I have at WGU is Discrete Mathematics II, and from what I’ve heard and read, just a TI-84 will suffice.  The course was just exams - no homeworks, projects, anything like that - and only the final was proctored.  There’re enough unit exams that you can make As on them and have a very nice safety net for the proctored final.  Also, Chegg is your best friend.  Pay the $20 and get a month’s subscription.  It’s beyond worth it.  Lastly, if you think you’re bad at math or that you wouldn’t do well at calculus: take it from me, it is possible.  I finished the course with an 87.  You just have to take full advantage of the resources available and you can succeed.  Don’t let calculus be the barrier between you and your BSCS.\\n\\n*Intro to Programming in C++*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 6/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~2.5 weeks\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * I actually learned a lot from this course.  Going into it, I wasn’t really expecting anything useful, but I came out of it feeling like I had a decent grasp on introductory C++.  Previously, the only languages I’d played around with are Python and HTML/CSS/JS.  This course took you through Zybooks (don’t crucify me for saying I actually learned a lot here), and the interactivity was very helpful for me.  Only complaint really is that there wasn’t a *ton* of writing your own code; the exercises were mostly fixing pre-written code or writing comparatively small sections of code.  It takes some effort to get through, and putting in said effort isn’t really optional in this case.  I actually *enjoyed* this course, and didn’t feel like I was just mindlessly clicking through shit.\\n\\n**Study.com**\\n\\nYou have the most course options on study.com, but it’s not super cheap either; it’s $200 for a month’s access, and that includes 2 final exam attempts.  For most courses, you’ll have an assignment/project to complete as well as the proctored final exam before you’re granted credit.  You can take a maximum of 5 final exams each month, and after your second one each exam costs $70.  So to maximize a month’s subscription, you’d take 5 final exams in total, which would cost $200 for the first two plus $210 for the extra 3.  The courses are generally fairly long and there’s a lot of content available to learn, so it’s a decent resource for learning but also for getting cheap credit transferred in.  I would recommend knocking out as much as you can with Sophia, then filling in the holes with Straighterline (if you need calculus) and then study.com for as much else as you can.\\n\\n\\*\\*You can see how credits transfer from study.com to WGU [here](https://partners.wgu.edu/Pages/Transfer.aspx?iid=1218&institution=Study.com)\\n\\n*Discrete Mathematics*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 5/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 weeks (but *should’ve* been like 2-3 days)\\n* Thoughts:\\n   * I say it should’ve been 2-3 days because I took this course before figuring out how to properly fudge study.com’s quizzes to get the maximum possible grade, so I ended up with a not-so-great overall quiz grade (because I rushed through them all) and had to try *really hard* on the final.  Most of study.com’s courses are weighted 100/100/100 (quizzes, assignment(s), final) but this one was just 100/200 (quizzes, final).  I generally divided up a course into 3 days: 1 to do all the quizzes, 1 for the assignment(s)/project(s), and 1 to take the final.  If you play your cards right, you can get near a 100% on the overall quiz grade, giving you a fair cushion to rawdog the final should you choose to do so.  YouTube and Github both have some great resources for helping you get through projects, too.  This advice stands for the rest of the study.com courses actually.  You get 3 chances per quiz to improve your grade, so definitely make the most of that.\\n\\n\\*Note on the database courses: as u/Confident_Natural_87 pointed out in the comments (and I forgot to include originally; my bad), there's a ridiculous amount of overlap between these three courses.  Once you finish Fundamentals, you'll have already completed about 40% of both Programming and Management.  And once you've finished Programming, you'll be about 80% done with Management.  So these three courses go back really quickly once you finish the Fundamentals, and it's not difficult anyway.  There's a *lot* of content to go over, but given all that overlap it's definitely not as daunting as it my initially seem.\\n\\n*Database Fundamentals*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Database Programming*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Database Management*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Introduction to Networking*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 4/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Intro to Cybersecurity*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 1/10\\n* Time to complete: 1 day\\n\\n*Data Structures & Algorithms*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 6/10\\n* Time to complete: \\~3 days\\n\\n*Artificial Intelligence*\\n\\n* Difficulty: 2/10\\n* Time to complete: 2 days\\n\\n**tl;dr**\\n\\nHere’s a list of the WGU courses I received transfer credit for from my BA:\\n\\n* C455: English Composition I\\n* C464: Introduction to Communication\\n* C768: Technical Communication\\n* C100: Introduction to Humanities\\n* C961: Ethics in Technology\\n* C963: American Politics and the US Constitution\\n* C255: Introduction to Geography\\n* C955: Applied Probability and Statistics\\n* C683: Natural Science Lab\\n* C165: Integrated Physical Science\\n\\nAnd Sophia:\\n\\n* C779: Web Development Foundations\\n* C176: Business of IT - Project Management\\n* D194: IT Leadership Foundations\\n\\nAnd Straighterline:\\n\\n* C958: Calculus I\\n* C182: Introduction to IT\\n* C173: Scripting and Programming - Foundations\\n\\nAnd study.com:\\n\\n* C959: Discrete Mathematics I\\n* C949: Data Structures and Algorithms I\\n* C836: Fundamentals of Information Security\\n* C175: Data Management - Foundations\\n* C170: Data Management - Applications\\n* D191: Advanced Data Management\\n* C951: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence\\n* C172: Network and Security - Foundations\\n\\nAnd, lastly, the courses I have remaining to take at WGU:\\n\\n* C846: Business of IT - Applications\\n* C867: Scripting and Programming - Applications\\n* C482: Software I\\n* C195: Software II - Advanced Java Concepts\\n* C188: Software Engineering\\n* C857: Software Quality Assurance\\n* C191: Operating Systems for Programmers\\n* C952: Computer Architecture\\n* C960: Discrete Mathematics II\\n* C950: Data Structures and Algorithms II\\n* C964: Computer Science Capstone\\n\\nHope this helps!  \n",

I just passed D427 yesterday morning (March 1) on my first attempt and thought I would get my obligatory write-up out of the way. This is probably going to be my longest write-up yet and creating these resources took a few hours, so I hope they help out.\\n\\nTo preface, I had almost zero SQL knowledge as I got an easy transfer for D426 - Foundations. Overall, in hindsight, I would say that this class was not too challenging and was actually kinda easy. I know I took 1.5mo to finish it but once again, like in my last class (C777), I had a mix of procrastination and personal things come up. When I actually actively started to learn the material it was around Feb 1st so overall it actually took me 29 days. I still hit my goal for time (just shy of a day), so I'm still pleased with my progress for acceleration purposes.\\n\\nOn my OA I [barely](https://i.gyazo.com/4eff1e9ad4c4cf00db426614bccb7141.png) passed. If I would have answered a single more query or MC question incorrectly, then I would have failed. So I think this post would be a great resource for knowing the BARE MINIMUM that you need to pass. Also I think I must have gotten most of the MC questions wrong as in the PA they were mostly in the first competency. A little more on my OA score later on...\\n\\nMy goal for this post isn't to regurgitate already said information, so I will focus on exactly what I did and what I thought really helped me the most, as well as my recommendations for you.\\n\\nAlso I have a very strong dislike for ANY coding, syntax, database stuff, etc., so if you at least don't mind it, you will already be a step ahead of me from the beginning.\\n\\n**I have created (3) resources to help y'all out with this exam.**\\n\\n(1) is this detailed post here on what I did, what worked for me, what I suggest you do, my overall experience, etc.\\n\\n(2) is my [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) which contains ALL syntax I studied for and details EXACTLY how to write each Syntax, along with some personalized pointers from me on each. There is more on this below.\\n\\n(3) is my [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub), which is a personalized word document that can hopefully serve as a Study Guide that is actually worth it's salt. My aim is for it to aid you in understanding core concepts useful for both the Multiple Choice and Performance based portions of the exam. Please don't waste your time going through the exorbitance that is the ZyBooks content.\\n\\n# My Approach\\n\\nDue to me starting with essentially no SQL experience and very little knowledge on relational databases I began by trying to learn the basics about what each statement does and some of the foundational knowledge. After trying the dreaded ZyBooks out at first I decided that I should just jump directly into the learning actual Syntax and how to write statements. Based on recommendations from this sub, this is the general path that I followed before taking the Pre-Assessment:\\n\\n[SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) \\- Every day (for about 2 weeks) I would try to do about 1-2 of the 18 total lessons, restarting at the beginning each day so that I could test myself on if I could remember the syntax. I would say this took the longest, even though in hindsight the statements were actually quite simple. I think that this was key to building up a good foundation for the level of syntax knowledge you need to know for the OA. Throughout the time I took on SQLBolt, part of it was asking ChatGPT questions about the syntax, like why I could do this but not this, what does the correct syntax for 'X statement' look like, etc. By the end of the 2 or so weeks of hitting SQLBolt, I could do over half of the exercises with no references.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql) \\- I took this course (1 day) to fill in more gaps when it comes to basic SQL, to test myself a little bit, and to keep reinforcing the syntax. Overall a great resource. Make sure you sign in using SSO with WGU. At this stage in my learning, the only thing I couldn't really do in this course was the CREATE VIEW statement.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql) \\- I took this course (1 day) to learn some things that weren't covered in SQLBolt and for the same reasons for the Intro DataCamp course. I learned a lot about WHY I used certain statements which was very important (mostly from ChatGPT). Some of those things include using things you probably WILL need to know for the exam like COUNT(), WHERE, GROUP BY, DECIMAL() and things you probably WON'T need for the exam like HAVING, ROUND, WHERE IN, DISTINCT+COUNT, LIKE. Still a good resource for reinforcement, though. Also, I only used double quotes until this point, make sure you ONLY use single quotes.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Joining Data in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql) \\- I DID NOT ACTUALLY COMPLETE THIS. I felt like I already had a good understanding of JOINS (you probably only need to know AND understand; INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN for the exam).\\n\\nSQLBolt - I returned to SQLBolt on 2/26 and needed reference on 8 total exercises, then came back 2/27 and only needed reference on 5 total exercises, then came back 2/28 and didn't need ANY reference for the exercises and could figure EVERYTHING out on my own. This was a big part of my success.\\n\\n[SQL-Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/) \\- This is a great resource as well, PLEASE use it. It took me only 1 day to get through this and I think it was very crucial to my success. Again, it helped with reinforcement and the biggest part of the exam IMO, which is actually understanding what statements to write based on what they are asking for. I only did the easy questions using the hospital theme. IMO you DON'T need to do the medium or hard questions as they go a little too deep for the what exam requires you to know, but it couldn't hurt.\\n\\n# Pre-Assessment/ZyBooks Labs\\n\\nSo on 2/27, the same day I couldn't do 5 of the exercises from SQLBolt without reference, I decided to take the Pre-A to see where I was at. [THIS](https://gyazo.com/041a2e83323fcad71deb8127a433d8d6) is my coaching report and I got about \\~39%. Pretty bad but I just couldn't do most of the statements outside of SELECT. For the MC questions as well, I saw some things I really didn't know anything about, but still got most of them correct by using common sense. This included the sublanguages (DML, DQL, etc.), VERY BASIC Cardinality, knowing which columns to use for PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY, and VERY BASIC Referential Integrity.\\n\\nI skimmed through the ZyBooks content (1, 2 ONLY, if that) and only fully completed some of the areas where I thought I may need more information on. I just actually wanted to look through the course content as I had neglected it prior. Overall I'd say this didn't really help me too much.\\n\\n**THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST THING THAT CONTRIBUTED TO MY SUCCESS (2-3 days):** one thing I did take from the ZyBooks content, however, was that it would show you EXACTLY how each statement should be structured. I took screenshots of them, and asked ChatGPT to essentially create ones for the ones ZyBooks was missing and it looked somewhat like [THIS](https://i.gyazo.com/bf607a23361b307fbcd117b747e83d74.png). From here, since I had an issue REMEMBERING how to write the statements in the moment, without reference, I would go through the list of file names, open a .txt document. And write a notional statement from memory. This plays on Rote Memorization a little bit but it works. If you can't remember that CREATE INDEX is \"CREATE INDEX index\\_name ON table\\_name (column1, column2)\" then just keep trying to type it from memory until you get it, only using the reference .png when you need it. I probably wrote hundreds of statements in just a couple days. If you want more information on how I did this process, let me know and I try will explain further and deeper.\\n\\nAfter doing this, I ran through the section 8/9 labs ONCE and ONCE only and could get through 90-95% of them without issue or needing reference. I then took the PA on 2/29 and [THIS](https://gyazo.com/939eb41e25f4bf012d4af259512b6dfb) was my coaching report. I got a 100%, but took it with a grain of salt as this was the THIRD time I had seen these questions. But nonetheless, I felt like I was ready for the OA.\\n\\nIf you get 100% on the PA, don't even bother taking it again. It only works to an extent as a method for testing, which is why I suggest not taking it AT ALL until you feel you are close to ready (this includes the CH8 labs).\\n\\n# The Exact Things I Studied:\\n\\nMy idea with this section is to tell you EXACTLY what I studied to get the score I did. Hypothetically if you study these exact things, you will pass as well. This course could benefit from a study guide that lists the statements and knowledge you need to know, but there isn't one as far as I am aware. The one provided by the CIs is very lackluster, IMO.\\n\\nHere is the [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) to my Imgur Album which contains every statement I studied for and what the CORRECT SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE. If you can write that statement with notional information with NO reference, you will be good for that specific syntax. The only one I didn't include that I studied was UNSIGNED, make sure you know that too.\\n\\nAlso, just skim through the labs and think to yourself, \"what are they asking me to write?\" Then, just pop off answers until you can figure it out. You should be able to IMMEDIATELY tell what the question is telling you to do. I.E.; \"Write something to create the BEANS table\" should connect in your brain with \"CREATE TABLE.\" This is also where the SQL-Practice resource I mentioned above can help. \\n\\n# The OA\\n\\nI felt that I was ready for the OA after taking the PA the final time and wanted to test the same night, but decided to let the information marinate in my brain for another day, so I waited until the next morning after some light study.\\n\\nI only took 41 minutes and at the time, I thought I was going to score at least 90%. I was super confident in my statements and MC answers but I was quickly humbled by my score after I refreshed the assessment page for 10 minutes and actually saw how close I came to failing. I am not proud of my score one bit, but a pass is still a pass and I get to put SQL and this course behind me for good.\\n\\nI only verified/checked half of my queries using SELECT \\* and DESC, making sure to remove those verification statements and run the code again without them. For some reason my programs would take 15-20 seconds to actually run, so during that time I would just re-read the question multiple times and look at my code to make sure I am doing exactly what they asked for. This led to me opting not to verify half of my statements due to the false confidence. This may have led to me almost failing, so please, actually take your time to verify EVERY statement you write and then go through them again to make sure at least run each statement again, without the verification statements.\\n\\nAs for overall OA difficulty, the OA is almost literally the same exact thing as the PA. Even down to sequencing of questions for which are MC and which are statements you must write. Obviously it isn't exactly the same but what others have preached about the exam rang true for me, and probably will for you as well. I really just think I probably answered most of the MC questions incorrectly and miswrote 1-3 statements and didn't verify them, but we will never know.\\n\\nTo regurgitate a little bit of information everybody else also says, to reinforce some consensus; if you can 100% the PA with no reference (without studying the answers), you will be totally OK, don't let the OA psych you out.\\n\\nI would say the biggest challenge of the exam to overcome is figuring out what the hell the question is asking you to do, and what you need to write to make that happen. To my understanding, as long as you can return exactly the information they want, you will be fine. So if you cannot figure out how to do something the way they probably want, but you can do the exact same thing in a different way, you will probably be okay. \\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe course can be intimating at first, especially for how shitty it is organized. I wish I had something like the [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) I just created to help me to know exactly what I needed to know, and a half-decent [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub). I seriously think that if you just follow my resources linked here then you will be good for the PA/OA. Obviously only use them as supplemental resources, not replacements.\\n\\nIf y'all need any help on any of this stuff or you want some more refined materials from me, let me know and I'd be happy to oblige.\\n\\nI did C777 and D427 back to back to get the \"harder\" courses out of the way. I look forward to getting back to the \"real\" accelerating.

I just passed D427 yesterday morning (March 1) on my first attempt and thought I would get my obligatory write-up out of the way. This is probably going to be my longest write-up yet and creating these resources took a few hours, so I hope they help out.\\n\\nTo preface, I had almost zero SQL knowledge as I got an easy transfer for D426 - Foundations. Overall, in hindsight, I would say that this class was not too challenging and was actually kinda easy. I know I took 1.5mo to finish it but once again, like in my last class (C777), I had a mix of procrastination and personal things come up. When I actually actively started to learn the material it was around Feb 1st so overall it actually took me 29 days. I still hit my goal for time (just shy of a day), so I'm still pleased with my progress for acceleration purposes.\\n\\nOn my OA I [barely](https://i.gyazo.com/4eff1e9ad4c4cf00db426614bccb7141.png) passed. If I would have answered a single more query or MC question incorrectly, then I would have failed. So I think this post would be a great resource for knowing the BARE MINIMUM that you need to pass. Also I think I must have gotten most of the MC questions wrong as in the PA they were mostly in the first competency. A little more on my OA score later on...\\n\\nMy goal for this post isn't to regurgitate already said information, so I will focus on exactly what I did and what I thought really helped me the most, as well as my recommendations for you.\\n\\nAlso I have a very strong dislike for ANY coding, syntax, database stuff, etc., so if you at least don't mind it, you will already be a step ahead of me from the beginning.\\n\\n**I have created (3) resources to help y'all out with this exam.**\\n\\n(1) is this detailed post here on what I did, what worked for me, what I suggest you do, my overall experience, etc.\\n\\n(2) is my [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) which contains ALL syntax I studied for and details EXACTLY how to write each Syntax, along with some personalized pointers from me on each. There is more on this below.\\n\\n(3) is my [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub), which is a personalized word document that can hopefully serve as a Study Guide that is actually worth it's salt. My aim is for it to aid you in understanding core concepts useful for both the Multiple Choice and Performance based portions of the exam. Please don't waste your time going through the exorbitance that is the ZyBooks content.\\n\\n# My Approach\\n\\nDue to me starting with essentially no SQL experience and very little knowledge on relational databases I began by trying to learn the basics about what each statement does and some of the foundational knowledge. After trying the dreaded ZyBooks out at first I decided that I should just jump directly into the learning actual Syntax and how to write statements. Based on recommendations from this sub, this is the general path that I followed before taking the Pre-Assessment:\\n\\n[SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) \\- Every day (for about 2 weeks) I would try to do about 1-2 of the 18 total lessons, restarting at the beginning each day so that I could test myself on if I could remember the syntax. I would say this took the longest, even though in hindsight the statements were actually quite simple. I think that this was key to building up a good foundation for the level of syntax knowledge you need to know for the OA. Throughout the time I took on SQLBolt, part of it was asking ChatGPT questions about the syntax, like why I could do this but not this, what does the correct syntax for 'X statement' look like, etc. By the end of the 2 or so weeks of hitting SQLBolt, I could do over half of the exercises with no references.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql) \\- I took this course (1 day) to fill in more gaps when it comes to basic SQL, to test myself a little bit, and to keep reinforcing the syntax. Overall a great resource. Make sure you sign in using SSO with WGU. At this stage in my learning, the only thing I couldn't really do in this course was the CREATE VIEW statement.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql) \\- I took this course (1 day) to learn some things that weren't covered in SQLBolt and for the same reasons for the Intro DataCamp course. I learned a lot about WHY I used certain statements which was very important (mostly from ChatGPT). Some of those things include using things you probably WILL need to know for the exam like COUNT(), WHERE, GROUP BY, DECIMAL() and things you probably WON'T need for the exam like HAVING, ROUND, WHERE IN, DISTINCT+COUNT, LIKE. Still a good resource for reinforcement, though. Also, I only used double quotes until this point, make sure you ONLY use single quotes.\\n\\n[DataCamp - Joining Data in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql) \\- I DID NOT ACTUALLY COMPLETE THIS. I felt like I already had a good understanding of JOINS (you probably only need to know AND understand; INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN for the exam).\\n\\nSQLBolt - I returned to SQLBolt on 2/26 and needed reference on 8 total exercises, then came back 2/27 and only needed reference on 5 total exercises, then came back 2/28 and didn't need ANY reference for the exercises and could figure EVERYTHING out on my own. This was a big part of my success.\\n\\n[SQL-Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/) \\- This is a great resource as well, PLEASE use it. It took me only 1 day to get through this and I think it was very crucial to my success. Again, it helped with reinforcement and the biggest part of the exam IMO, which is actually understanding what statements to write based on what they are asking for. I only did the easy questions using the hospital theme. IMO you DON'T need to do the medium or hard questions as they go a little too deep for the what exam requires you to know, but it couldn't hurt.\\n\\n# Pre-Assessment/ZyBooks Labs\\n\\nSo on 2/27, the same day I couldn't do 5 of the exercises from SQLBolt without reference, I decided to take the Pre-A to see where I was at. [THIS](https://gyazo.com/041a2e83323fcad71deb8127a433d8d6) is my coaching report and I got about \\~39%. Pretty bad but I just couldn't do most of the statements outside of SELECT. For the MC questions as well, I saw some things I really didn't know anything about, but still got most of them correct by using common sense. This included the sublanguages (DML, DQL, etc.), VERY BASIC Cardinality, knowing which columns to use for PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY, and VERY BASIC Referential Integrity.\\n\\nI skimmed through the ZyBooks content (1, 2 ONLY, if that) and only fully completed some of the areas where I thought I may need more information on. I just actually wanted to look through the course content as I had neglected it prior. Overall I'd say this didn't really help me too much.\\n\\n**THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST THING THAT CONTRIBUTED TO MY SUCCESS (2-3 days):** one thing I did take from the ZyBooks content, however, was that it would show you EXACTLY how each statement should be structured. I took screenshots of them, and asked ChatGPT to essentially create ones for the ones ZyBooks was missing and it looked somewhat like [THIS](https://i.gyazo.com/bf607a23361b307fbcd117b747e83d74.png). From here, since I had an issue REMEMBERING how to write the statements in the moment, without reference, I would go through the list of file names, open a .txt document. And write a notional statement from memory. This plays on Rote Memorization a little bit but it works. If you can't remember that CREATE INDEX is \"CREATE INDEX index\\_name ON table\\_name (column1, column2)\" then just keep trying to type it from memory until you get it, only using the reference .png when you need it. I probably wrote hundreds of statements in just a couple days. If you want more information on how I did this process, let me know and I try will explain further and deeper.\\n\\nAfter doing this, I ran through the section 8/9 labs ONCE and ONCE only and could get through 90-95% of them without issue or needing reference. I then took the PA on 2/29 and [THIS](https://gyazo.com/939eb41e25f4bf012d4af259512b6dfb) was my coaching report. I got a 100%, but took it with a grain of salt as this was the THIRD time I had seen these questions. But nonetheless, I felt like I was ready for the OA.\\n\\nIf you get 100% on the PA, don't even bother taking it again. It only works to an extent as a method for testing, which is why I suggest not taking it AT ALL until you feel you are close to ready (this includes the CH8 labs).\\n\\n# The Exact Things I Studied:\\n\\nMy idea with this section is to tell you EXACTLY what I studied to get the score I did. Hypothetically if you study these exact things, you will pass as well. This course could benefit from a study guide that lists the statements and knowledge you need to know, but there isn't one as far as I am aware. The one provided by the CIs is very lackluster, IMO.\\n\\nHere is the [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) to my Imgur Album which contains every statement I studied for and what the CORRECT SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE. If you can write that statement with notional information with NO reference, you will be good for that specific syntax. The only one I didn't include that I studied was UNSIGNED, make sure you know that too.\\n\\nAlso, just skim through the labs and think to yourself, \"what are they asking me to write?\" Then, just pop off answers until you can figure it out. You should be able to IMMEDIATELY tell what the question is telling you to do. I.E.; \"Write something to create the BEANS table\" should connect in your brain with \"CREATE TABLE.\" This is also where the SQL-Practice resource I mentioned above can help. \\n\\n# The OA\\n\\nI felt that I was ready for the OA after taking the PA the final time and wanted to test the same night, but decided to let the information marinate in my brain for another day, so I waited until the next morning after some light study.\\n\\nI only took 41 minutes and at the time, I thought I was going to score at least 90%. I was super confident in my statements and MC answers but I was quickly humbled by my score after I refreshed the assessment page for 10 minutes and actually saw how close I came to failing. I am not proud of my score one bit, but a pass is still a pass and I get to put SQL and this course behind me for good.\\n\\nI only verified/checked half of my queries using SELECT \\* and DESC, making sure to remove those verification statements and run the code again without them. For some reason my programs would take 15-20 seconds to actually run, so during that time I would just re-read the question multiple times and look at my code to make sure I am doing exactly what they asked for. This led to me opting not to verify half of my statements due to the false confidence. This may have led to me almost failing, so please, actually take your time to verify EVERY statement you write and then go through them again to make sure at least run each statement again, without the verification statements.\\n\\nAs for overall OA difficulty, the OA is almost literally the same exact thing as the PA. Even down to sequencing of questions for which are MC and which are statements you must write. Obviously it isn't exactly the same but what others have preached about the exam rang true for me, and probably will for you as well. I really just think I probably answered most of the MC questions incorrectly and miswrote 1-3 statements and didn't verify them, but we will never know.\\n\\nTo regurgitate a little bit of information everybody else also says, to reinforce some consensus; if you can 100% the PA with no reference (without studying the answers), you will be totally OK, don't let the OA psych you out.\\n\\nI would say the biggest challenge of the exam to overcome is figuring out what the hell the question is asking you to do, and what you need to write to make that happen. To my understanding, as long as you can return exactly the information they want, you will be fine. So if you cannot figure out how to do something the way they probably want, but you can do the exact same thing in a different way, you will probably be okay. \\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe course can be intimating at first, especially for how shitty it is organized. I wish I had something like the [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) I just created to help me to know exactly what I needed to know, and a half-decent [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub). I seriously think that if you just follow my resources linked here then you will be good for the PA/OA. Obviously only use them as supplemental resources, not replacements.\\n\\nIf y'all need any help on any of this stuff or you want some more refined materials from me, let me know and I'd be happy to oblige.\\n\\nI did C777 and D427 back to back to get the \"harder\" courses out of the way. I look forward to getting back to the \"real\" accelerating.

                                                                      Summary – Data Management Applications (D427) – Passed in 44 days\\nHey y'all. I just passed D427 yesterday morning (March 1) on my first attempt and thought I would get my obligatory write-up out of the way. This is probably going to be my longest write-up yet and creating these resources took a few hours, so I hope they help out.\\n\\nTo preface, I had almost zero SQL knowledge as I got an easy transfer for D426 - Foundations. Overall, in hindsight, I would say that this class was not too challenging and was actually kinda easy. I know I took 1.5mo to finish it but once again, like in my last class (C777), I had a mix of procrastination and personal things come up. When I actually actively started to learn the material it was around Feb 1st so overall it actually took me 29 days. I still hit my goal for time (just shy of a day), so I'm still pleased with my progress for acceleration purposes.\\n\\nOn my OA I [barely](https://i.gyazo.com/4eff1e9ad4c4cf00db426614bccb7141.png) passed. If I would have answered a single more query or MC question incorrectly, then I would have failed. So I think this post would be a great resource for knowing the BARE MINIMUM that you need to pass. Also I think I must have gotten most of the MC questions wrong as in the PA they were mostly in the first competency. A little more on my OA score later on...\\n\\nMy goal for this post isn't to regurgitate already said information, so I will focus on exactly what I did and what I thought really helped me the most, as well as my recommendations for you.\\n\\nAlso I have a very strong dislike for ANY coding, syntax, database stuff, etc., so if you at least don't mind it, you will already be a step ahead of me from the beginning.\\n\\n**I have created (3) resources to help y'all out with this exam.**\\n\\n* (1) is this detailed post here on what I did, what worked for me, what I suggest you do, my overall experience, etc.\\n* (2) is my [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) which contains ALL syntax I studied for and details EXACTLY how to write each Syntax, along with some personalized pointers from me on each. There is more on this below.\\n* (3) is my [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub), which is a personalized word document that can hopefully serve as a Study Guide that is actually worth it's salt. My aim is for it to aid you in understanding core concepts useful for both the Multiple Choice and Performance based portions of the exam. Please don't waste your time going through the exorbitance that is the ZyBooks content.\\n\\n# My Approach\\n\\nDue to me starting with essentially no SQL experience and very little knowledge on relational databases I began by trying to learn the basics about what each statement does and some of the foundational knowledge. After trying the dreaded ZyBooks out at first I decided that I should just jump directly into the learning actual Syntax and how to write statements. Based on recommendations from this sub, this is the general path that I followed before taking the Pre-Assessment:\\n\\n* [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/) - Every day (for about **2 weeks**) I would try to do about 1-2 of the 18 total lessons, restarting at the beginning each day so that I could test myself on if I could remember the syntax. I would say this took the longest, even though in hindsight the statements were actually quite simple. I think that this was key to building up a good foundation for the level of syntax knowledge you need to know for the OA. Throughout the time I took on SQLBolt, part of it was asking ChatGPT questions about the syntax, like why I could do this but not this, what does the correct syntax for 'X statement' look like, etc. By the end of the 2 or so weeks of hitting SQLBolt, I could do over half of the exercises with no references.\\n* [DataCamp - Introduction to SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-sql) - I took this course (**1 day**) to fill in more gaps when it comes to basic SQL, to test myself a little bit, and to keep reinforcing the syntax. Overall a great resource. Make sure you sign in using SSO with WGU. At this stage in my learning, the only thing I couldn't really do in this course was the CREATE VIEW statement.\\n* [DataCamp - Intermediate SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-sql) - I took this course (**1 day**) to learn some things that weren't covered in SQLBolt and for the same reasons for the Intro DataCamp course. I learned a lot about WHY I used certain statements which was very important (mostly from ChatGPT).  Some of those things include using things you probably WILL need to know for the exam like COUNT(), WHERE, GROUP BY, DECIMAL() and things you probably WON'T need for the exam like HAVING, ROUND, WHERE IN, DISTINCT+COUNT, LIKE. Still a good resource for reinforcement, though. Also, I only used double quotes until this point, **make sure you ONLY use single quotes**.\\n* [DataCamp - Joining Data in SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/joining-data-in-sql) - I DID NOT ACTUALLY COMPLETE THIS. I felt like I already had a good understanding of JOINS (you probably only need to know AND understand; INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, LEFT JOIN for the exam).\\n* SQLBolt - I returned to SQLBolt on 2/26 and needed reference on 8 total exercises, then came back 2/27 and only needed reference on 5 total exercises, then came back 2/28 and didn't need ANY reference for the exercises and could figure EVERYTHING out on my own. This was a big part of my success.\\n* [SQL-Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/) - This is a great resource as well, PLEASE use it. It took me only **1 day** to get through this and I think it was very crucial to my success. Again, it helped with reinforcement and the biggest part of the exam IMO, which is actually understanding what statements to write based on what they are asking for. I only did the easy questions using the hospital theme. IMO you DON'T need to do the medium or hard questions as they go a little too deep for the what exam requires you to know, but it couldn't hurt.\\n\\n# Pre-Assessment/ZyBooks Labs\\n\\n* So on 2/27, the same day I couldn't do 5 of the exercises from SQLBolt without reference, I decided to take the Pre-A to see where I was at. [THIS](https://gyazo.com/041a2e83323fcad71deb8127a433d8d6) is my coaching report and I got about \\~39%. Pretty bad but I just couldn't do most of the statements outside of SELECT. For the MC questions as well, I saw some things I really didn't know anything about, but still got most of them correct by using common sense. This included the sublanguages (DML, DQL, etc.), VERY BASIC Cardinality, knowing which columns to use for PRIMARY KEY/FOREIGN KEY, and VERY BASIC Referential Integrity.\\n* I skimmed through the ZyBooks content (1, 2 ONLY, if that) and only fully completed some of the areas where I thought I may need more information on. I just actually wanted to look through the course content as I had neglected it prior. Overall I'd say this didn't really help me too much.\\n* **THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST THING THAT CONTRIBUTED TO MY SUCCESS (2-3 days)**: one thing I did take from the ZyBooks content, however, was that it would show you EXACTLY how each statement should be structured. I took screenshots of them, and asked ChatGPT to essentially create ones for the ones ZyBooks was missing and it looked somewhat like [THIS](https://i.gyazo.com/bf607a23361b307fbcd117b747e83d74.png). From here, since I had an issue REMEMBERING how to write the statements in the moment, without reference, I would go through the list of file names, open a .txt document. And write a notional statement from memory. This plays on Rote Memorization a little bit but it works. If you can't remember that CREATE INDEX is \"CREATE INDEX index\\_name ON table\\_name (column1, column2)\" then just keep trying to type it from memory until you get it, only using the reference .png when you need it. I probably wrote hundreds of statements in just a couple days. If you want more information on how I did this process, let me know and I try will explain further and deeper.\\n* After doing this, I ran through the section 8/9 labs ONCE and ONCE only and could get through 90-95% of them without issue or needing reference. I then took the PA on 2/29 and [THIS](https://gyazo.com/939eb41e25f4bf012d4af259512b6dfb) was my coaching report. I got a 100%, but took it with a grain of salt as this was the THIRD time I had seen these questions. But nonetheless, I felt like I was ready for the OA.\\n* If you get 100% on the PA, don't even bother taking it again. It only works to an extent as a method for testing, which is why I suggest not taking it AT ALL until you feel you are close to ready (this includes the CH8 labs).\\n\\n# The Exact Things I Studied:\\n\\nMy idea with this section is to tell you EXACTLY what I studied to get the score I did. Hypothetically if you study these exact things, you will pass as well. This course could benefit from a study guide that lists the statements and knowledge you need to know, but there isn't one as far as I am aware. The one provided by the CIs is very lackluster, IMO.\\n\\nHERE is the [LINK](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) to my Imgur Album which contains *every* statement I studied for and what the CORRECT SYNTAX LOOKS LIKE. If you can write that statement with notional information with NO reference, you will be good for that specific syntax. The only one I didn't include that I studied was UNSIGNED, make sure you know that too.\\n\\nAlso, just skim through the labs and think to yourself, \"*what are they asking me to write*?\" Then, just pop off answers until you can figure it out. You should be able to IMMEDIATELY tell what the question is telling you to do. I.E.;  \"Write something to create the BEANS table\" should connect in your brain with \"CREATE TABLE.\" This is also where the SQL-Practice resource I mentioned above can help.\\n\\n# The OA\\n\\nI felt that I was ready for the OA after taking the PA the final time and wanted to test the same night, but decided to let the information marinate in my brain for another day, so I waited until the next morning after some light study.\\n\\nI only took 41 minutes and at the time, I thought I was going to score *at least* 90%. I was super confident in my statements and MC answers but I was quickly humbled by my score after I refreshed the assessment page for 10 minutes and actually saw how close I came to failing. I am not proud of my score one bit, but a pass is still a pass and I get to put SQL and this course behind me for good.\\n\\nI only verified/checked half of my queries using SELECT \\* and DESC, making sure to remove those verification statements and run the code again without them. For some reason my programs would take 15-20 seconds to actually run, so during that time I would just re-read the question multiple times and look at my code to make sure I am doing *exactly* what they asked for. This led to me opting not to verify half of my statements due to the false confidence. This may have led to me almost failing, so please, actually take your time to verify EVERY statement you write and then go through them again to make sure at least run each statement again, without the verification statements.\\n\\nAs for overall OA difficulty, the OA is almost literally the same exact thing as the PA. Even down to sequencing of questions for which are MC and which are statements you must write. Obviously it isn't *exactly* the same but what others have preached about the exam rang true for me, and probably will for you as well. I really just think I probably answered most of the MC questions incorrectly and miswrote 1-3 statements and didn't verify them, but we will never know.\\n\\nTo regurgitate a little bit of information everybody else also says, to reinforce some consensus; if you can 100% the PA with no reference (without studying the answers), you will be totally OK, don't let the OA psych you out.\\n\\nI would say the biggest challenge of the exam to overcome is figuring out what the hell the question is asking you to do, and what you need to write to make that happen. To my understanding, as long as you can return exactly the information they want, you will be fine. So if you cannot figure out how to do something the way they probably want, but you can do the exact same thing in a different way, you will probably be okay.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThe course can be intimating at first, especially for how shitty it is organized. I wish I had something like the [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/0Gb8Ddc) I just created to help me to know exactly what I needed to know, and a half-decent [Study Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR04L0rVAqKPRXd3-QwihGhm1iGkvVg4UZ4r3VGjRfeTTdbDufnvNRoXL57n5enQhkH6J-3f6o0q68T/pub). I seriously think that if you just follow my resources linked here then you will be good for the PA/OA. Obviously only use them as supplemental resources, not replacements.\\n\\nIf y'all need any help on any of this stuff or you want some more refined materials from me, let me know and I'd be happy to oblige.\\n\\nI did C777 and D427 back to back to get the \"harder\" courses out of the way. I look forward to getting back to the \"real\" accelerating. Stay tuned for my C773 User Interface Design post soon.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                    Summary – Ethics in Technology D333 – Passed in 8 days \\nI have a few of these write-ups on the backburner so I thought I’d knock a couple out. I completed D333 early August but am only now getting around to doing my summary for it.\\n\\nGoing into the course, the recon I did nearly a year ago led me to believe this would be an extremely easy course, simply a case of studying up on a few key topics and applying common sense. The more recent recon I did back in early August revealed there was a ton of people who have struggled with this course, so it is obviously a bit more challenging and involved than I previously anticipated. With hindsight, this is mostly true, but the common-sense notion still is a key part of this course IMO.\\n\\nI recommend to enter the course under the perception that this class is at least moderately difficult, so you don’t become overconfident and potentially fail. It can and does go by fast though, when you focus your approach to the course material and key concepts.\\n\\n# My Approach\\n\\nSince this was a class with an OA, my original plan was to go through the course material in its entirety, taking notes on key terms and concepts, formulating those into flash cards, and eventually studying those flashcards until I had good enough active recall to pass the exam. I prefer this method over simply reading and studying notes as I just find it more effective in an exam context. I mostly stuck to this plan, but deviated by not going over the entire course content. If I had to guess I would say I only \"studied\" from about 5% of the total course content from the main textbooks.\\n\\nFor course material there are 12 “modules” derived individually from 2 textbooks; **C**omputing & **T**echnology **E**thics (**CTE**) and **E**thics **i**n **T**echnology (**EIT**). Modules 1, 2, 4, 12 are from CTE. Modules 5, 6-11 are from EIT. It is easy to get overwhelmed with this course content but **you do not need to read all of it**. CTE is by far the more boring of the two and does not have summaries. I attempted to follow it but I admittedly dropped it fairly quickly. EIT is definitely more readable and has very effective summaries built into it which are \"good enough,\" IMO.\\n\\nThe first day, I skimmed most of EIT (mostly the summaries) then took the Pre-Assessment a few hours later. I did pass by about 5% or so which actually surprised me. I feel if I took the OA then I probably would have failed, as the OA is a bit harder than the Pre-A so, IMO, to be in a good place to take the OA you should aim for at least 80% on the Pre-A to have a reasonable margin of error.\\n\\n# Study Methodology\\n\\nBy far, the single most useful resource provided in this course is the [**Study Notes**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/Things%20to%20read/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read%2FD333%20study%20notes%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read) resource, which is simply a copy/paste of the summaries from the EIT textbook provided by the CIs. Honestly, I’m not even sure why the first textbook is included for this course, as the modules directly pertaining to it are entirely covered by EIT. I studied those chapters for CTE using EIT instead, so IMO it is supplemental at best. I think you would be fine completely neglecting CTE.\\n\\nOutside of that, I seriously believe that the **Study Notes** is all you need for course content, outside of covering a few other \"small things,\" which I will get too soon. Most of it is extremely relevant to the OA. I used the **Study Notes solely** as my main course material, going through the entire document and further summarizing it for my own notes/flashcards. This only took a few days (before studying/memorizing).\\n\\nI was going to complete the \"Study Guide\" but refrained as I thought it was unnecessary. If you are having continued trouble with the course content, I would suggest it, though. It just seemed a bit too time consuming for me and seemed unnecessary in my situation.\\n\\nThe [**Acronym Glossary**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BB5F683B8-96C0-4546-9B9B-18F6C32480AB%7D&file=Tech%20Ethics%20Acronym%20Glossary%20(highlighted).docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true) may also be a useful resource, but I didn’t use it. Also, these [**PowerPoint/Sway**](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e81CAA&groupId=&searchTerm=&courseCode=D333&rtn=/apex/CommonsExpandedSearch) presentations may be useful if you want a more intuitive way to study the course material (WIP).\\n\\nNext, I found [**this beautiful resource**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqHCZYMgKoKTQF4IXGoldfk_8aI8JaYq/view) provided by another reddit user outlining what EVERY law is about. Pay attention to the “token” section of the documents as it gives you a quick definition to remember for that law, which is IMO enough to differentiate between them based on the context you will be provided in the exam. Make sure you 100% study these. If you see ISAE No. 3402 on the exam, you should immediately be thinking of international audit reporting rules and not much else. In all, there are **47 laws** to study this way, and with the “token” terms they go real quick, I was able to get them down in about a day.\\n\\nThere are a couple more small things you need to study for to be prepared for the exam. [**Ethical Frameworks**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B6094069C-C43F-4A21-96C1-F4B360DD0B86%7D&file=TechEthics%20Frameworks.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true) is one. It is very simple to get down, maybe even watch some [**Hank**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a739VjqdSI&t=1s) on YouTube to get it down even better. I can assure you that you will have questions relating to this area on the exam. [**Here**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20watch%2FEthical%20Frameworks%2Emp4&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2E9c9f9847%2De702%2D4f5a%2D9c41%2D223728e805a3) is a video from a CI going into these ethical frameworks.  \\n\\nNext small thing on the agenda is [**Ethical/Legal & Authorized/Intended**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B992CC5BA-2163-4F5E-9244-B05599B7236F%7D&file=ethical%20legal%20authorized%20intended.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true) style questions. Again, you will probably see this on the exam, and quite a few times at that. [**Here**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/_layouts/15/stream.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20watch%2Fethical%20legal%20scenarios%2Emp4&referrer=StreamWebApp%2EWeb&referrerScenario=AddressBarCopied%2Eview%2Eaa28805b%2D25a1%2D4e02%2Db23d%2D95471fa67a2c) is a video from a CI going into these types of questions.\\n\\nThe [**PAPA**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utd_sn7EYts) model is another thing that you will need to study. This is the most ambiguous bit, IMO, so I will just provide definitions here to help out:\\n\\n* **Property**: Rights and ownership of information (For who owns it and how it can be used or distributed).\\n* **Access**: Right/ability to obtain and use information (Protecting it from unauthorized access).\\n* **Privacy**: Right of the individual to control the collection/storage/sharing of their personal information.\\n* **Accuracy**: Ensuring that information is correct/reliable/free from errors, for preventing misinformation or harm.\\n\\nThe final small thing is [**AI Bias**](https://westerngovernorsuniversity.sharepoint.com/sites/D333SupplementalResources/Things%20to%20read/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read%2FAI%2DBias%2Dand%2DFairness%2DTerms%2Dto%2DKnow%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FD333SupplementalResources%2FThings%20to%20read), and again, you will 99.9999%+ have questions on this. The article goes into enough depth, IMO.\\n\\nAll of this content I described above, I made flash cards for, and fully memorized each. You can slack somewhat on the course material, but not on these areas. I had about 19 flash cards for AI Bias but got it down somewhat quickly. I had \\~180 terms from the course material, 47 from the laws, and about 30 for these “smaller things.” ~~If you want the flash cards let me know. If enough people want them, I can start to set them up to be distributed as I haven’t deleted them yet~~. ***As of 2/1/25 I have recovered the flash cards and made them available for importing,*** [***HERE***](https://send.vis.ee/download/5d0a3cc728744636/#GMtA4ONkPuf1duoHK30NPQ) ***is the link for that. If the link expires, just DM me or leave a comment and I will send you a fresh link.*** \\n\\n# Final Pre-Assessment Attempt:\\n\\nFor my memorization, I only ended up studying 1/3 of the main course content “fully,” which means to the level of almost instant active recall. I 100% fully memorized the “small stuff,” however. After drilling the main course content for a couple days, I decided I would take the Pre-A one last time and decide to take the OA based on the results. I made sure not to review the questions/answers after my first Pre-A attempt, and I would encourage you to do the same so you have an adequate benchmark for readiness.\\n\\nI did make a great improvement over the first attempt, scoring \\~90% vs \\~80%, subsequently feeling pretty prepared for the exam. I immediately scheduled the OA for about an hour out and began skimming through the rest of my flash cards and hitting the laws and “small stuff” again and again until it was time.\\n\\n# The OA:\\n\\nThis was actually my first exam experience with the unnamed proctoring service (my post will get auto removed by the mods if I mention it), so that was interesting. No huge issues with them besides having to repeatedly take pictures of my workspace as it kept resetting for some reason. Also, I had to sign into WGU from the unnamed service's browser, and I use unique and secure passwords for everything, so I had to exit out of the browser, enter my password manager, copy it to my clipboard, then re-enter the browser and re-do the check-in process. Not the best or most streamlined experience but it still worked so… I guess it is fine. No major issue or horror story.\\n\\nFor the actual OA, questions were somewhat different to the PA. Some questions were very easy, others were way more difficult. When people say that you have 2 good answers and 1 best answer, they are mostly correct. If you know your stuff, you will know the answer almost immediately, otherwise you will be making informed guesses. There were a couple straight dumb questions in my case, however. They asked something extremely specific regarding a very popular vendor certification which I thought was way out of scope. Luckily, I have a networking background so I was able to immediately know what the right answer was by recalling peers’ experiences with the listed particular certifications from this vendor.\\n\\n68 questions total, 2 of which were survey questions (Something new, I think?). I ensured I took my time with the questions; I took about an hour for a minute per question and carefully reviewing my selections. It looks like I got about an \\~80% with the only area not being competent being “identifies interventions.” When submitting the exam, I wasn’t sure if I was going to pass, I thought it was going to be very close and could go either way, but I was surprised.\\n\\n[OA Results](https://preview.redd.it/dyx72tg87mqd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=08d31de4a58a1d9048810b9ff9f8205bccce8a22)\\n\\n# Conclusion:\\n\\nAs long as you 100% study the “small stuff” I described above and at least are at least somewhat familiar with the course material from the EIT textbook, you will pass. I honestly think that is all there is to it besides having a little common sense. Even then, I could have done less and still passed so maybe you don’t even need to 100% the “small stuff.”\\n\\nAs always, if you need some help on the course, feel free to reach out.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: As of 2/1/25 I have recovered the flash cards and made them available for importing, [HERE](https://send.vis.ee/download/5d0a3cc728744636/#GMtA4ONkPuf1duoHK30NPQ) is the link for that.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Completed the WGU MSCSIA Graduate Degree in One Term (Long Post and No Credits Transferred In)\\nFinished the WGU MSCSIA Graduate Degree in One Term (No credits transferred into program)\\n\\nGood afternoon, WGU Cybersecurity subreddit.  I figured that I would pay it forward this morning with providing my experience of the WGU MSCSIA program and what it took for me to graduate in one term. I was intimidated by the unknown; however, when I finally got my footing, I was able to hammer down and complete the work. This will be a long review and I have incorporated some “Lessons Learned” from redditors looking for advice for completing the program.\\n\\nTerm Duration: August 2024 - December 2024\\n\\nGraduation Goal: I had established a tentative graduation goal of February 2025.  I was okay with spending a year to obtain this degree. I can honestly say that having a Program Mentor who was supportive of my plan was a major contributor in my ability to progress as efficiently as I did.\\n\\nBackground Education: B.S. Criminal Justice Administration and Management, Master of Public Administration, M.S. Occupational Safety and Health.\\n\\nCertifications: PMP, PMI-ACP, ASQ-CQE, ASQ-CSSBB, ASQ-CMQ/OE, and a number of other certifications that I thought would transfer but did not transfer over.\\n\\nWork Experience: 20 years of experience within the Military, Automotive, Medical (Medical Device and Information Technology Contracting), and Nuclear - Operations, Engineering, and Security industries. Currently employed with a National Laboratory as a Project Manager; and pursuing a career within the Software Quality Engineering and Cybersecurity fields.\\n\\nRefer to the attached photo for timelines for each course. If you do not like the language that I use to explain my experience, please feel free to use your vocabulary to substitute my swear words for a word to your liking…hahaha 🤷🏾‍♂️\\n\\nD481: Security Foundations -  First course of the term.  I had butterflies and anxiety in preparing for the certification.  I leveraged Thor Pedersen’s course on Udemy to get me help me understand the material. I wanted to complete this course before taking an international trip for work.\\n\\nD482: Secure Network Design - I took a little longer than I wanted to with this course.  I had to travel internationally for work once again.  I was able to study abroad during my morning workouts.  I leveraged Jason Dion’s Network+ Course.  The cohort video helped immensely as well.  I have Microsoft Visio experience and can say that it helped me in completing the diagram for this course. I had to revise my submission; however, it was an easy fix and I was able to resubmit and pass the second time around.\\n\\nD483: Security Operations - I took a domestic work trip during this period.  I decided to rewatch the Jason Dion’s Network+ course in addition to his CySA+ course and Andrew Ramdayal’s CompTIA Network+ course (This was the best course for me because Ramdayal provided practical examples with equipment as opposed to Dion just talking at the screen).  My Program Mentor reached out to me to check on me…hahaha…I told him that there was a method to my madness.  Also, it helps to have colleagues that are Cybersecurity professionals who provided the advice that understanding networking will make everything else easier. Passed the CySA+ course.  I submitted the PA and believe it was a first-time go.\\n\\nD484: Penetration Testing - I thought about kicking the can down the road regarding this course.  I started studying this course while in the D483 course so that I could get a headstart on the material.  I purchased a year subscription to TryHackMe and it was clutch.  I leveraged Reddit posts from the WGU Cybersecurity subreddit to help as well.  I was not the most confident going into the testing center to complete this course.  Throughout the entire test, I thought to myself “I am fucking failing this motherfucker” as I progressed throughout the entire test.  I finally arrived at the end and had to go through the survey which only adds to the anxiety of the exam.  I passed the exam with a higher score than I achieved on the CySA+ exam.  The PA part of the course was easier; however, I had to revise and submit a second time.  I didn’t mind and I had overcome the Penetration Testing Monster. Before starting this course, I spoke to my Program Mentor and asked if it was doable to complete this curriculum in one term after completing the PenTest+ exam.  He gave me confidence that most students are able to complete the curriculum at an accelerated pace after completing the required certifications. I took his word as the gospel and immediately hammered down to complete this rest of the curriculum.\\n\\nD485: Cloud Security - I will start by saying that this is the worst fucking course in the curriculum due to the lab environment.  I had to request additional time to complete this lab.  I didn’t even get to finish the entire lab and had to communicate this within my PA along with the proposed recommendations for the one of the subtasks within the PA.  I thought for sure that this motherfucker was going to come back for a revision.  To my surprise, it was a “first-time go” and I ended up receiving an award for the PA.  I was pretty happy about this one.  I liked the material but the lab fucking sucks. My Program Mentor warned me about this course being one of the courses that can cause headaches to students.  My advice is to watch the cohorts and be kind to yourself. \\n\\nD486: Governance, Risk, and Compliance - This course was one of the easier courses.  I believe that this course was a good course.  I also work in a heavily regulated industry (Nuclear) so I was able to knock this course out in days.  \\n\\nD487: Secure Software Design - I took the PA for this course and passed.  I figured that I would download the course materials and absorb the text book.  This is also a course that my Program Mentor warned me about.  I was able to pass the OA the first time.  This is the course where I discovered the Try Hard Security [HackNow] Discord channel (If I would have had access to this resource sooner, I probably would have been able to learn the material and finish faster…🤦🏾‍♂️).  \\n\\nD488: Cybersecurity Architecture and Engineering - I was excited about this course.  I was also in a groove to finish earlier than my tentative goal and decided to take the PA in the early hours (0130 -0300).  I failed the practice OA (I was literally falling asleep as I went through this practice OA).  I retook the practice OA and passed so that I could get the voucher.  The confirmation of the voucher email was followed up with an email from my Program Mentor ensuring that I learn the material as opposed to remembering it (Fair Point).  I took the OA and failed by one question.  I immediately emailed the Course Instructor with my plan to remedy the issue if he would let me take the OA again without having to go through the hoops of completing so many assignments to be able to test again.  The Course Instructor was awesome and immediately approved my request.  I studied the CertMaster Material in addition to Mark Birch’s guide (found within the course materials of the course - I believe the last section of the course that lists all of the labs, CertMaster material, etc.).  I took the OA again the second day in which I had a good feeling about it…After completing the OA, my results were not available for 24 hours.  I called Assessment Services twice within the 24 hours in which the first call yielded a response from the specialist stating that “results will be available within 72 hours after taking the assessment.”  I waited for my results to come and even lost sleep wondering about the results.  I called Assessment services the next day and a very helpful specialist went above and beyond to access my results and tell me that I passed this OA.  I was relieved due to the fact that I was working on my assignments for D489 and D490 (pretty much had them completed) and the D490 Course Instructor had approved my Capstone topic; contingent on me passing this course.  I had submitted D489 as well.  So you can imagine the anxiety from this course. I am currently studying for CASP+ examination in which I will taking in two days.\\n\\nD489: Cybersecurity Management - This course was one of the easier courses for me.  I have experience in Program and Project Management and I was able to complete this course within a few days.  I had to resubmit to provide clarity on one of the subtasks; however, this one was one of the easier courses for me.\\n\\nD490: Cybersecurity Graduate Capstone - The dreaded capstone…hahaha…joking…the hardest part of this course was the fact that my Course Instructor approved my topic without signing the Capstone Approval form (contingent on D488 and  D489 passing).  To increase complexity, the Course Instructor went on vacation and provided an email to the MSITCapstone address where the curse instructors would receive any of the project proposal topic request and would be able to approve. Be careful and make sure that you receive the correct email capstone email.  The course instructor provided the email on her away replies; however, she added an extra “s” to the email.  I kept sending my form to the address and I kept receiving a message saying that my message was not received (I add read/delivery receipts to every email that I send…just a habit and also as proof that I sent the email in addition of being able to receive notification of the recipient reading the email.).  My program mentor finally found the problem and thought that I just entered too many characters (I copied the email from the course instructor; however, I take full accountability for not checking and letting my impulsivity get in the way.).  Another professor reviewed the approval form and considered my project viable giving me the green light to submit task one (I had to wait a whole six days before being able to submit my task due to the email mishap…for fucks sake).  I submitted Task One  and it was approved (43 hours).  Luckily for me, I had been working on both tasks two and three while waiting the long six days and while I was completing D487 - D489.  After I received the passing notification for task one, I applied the final touches to both tasks two and three.  I also did my due diligence on the possibility of submitting the courses in at the same time in which there were mixed reviews on this matter.  After completing my due diligence, I decided to err on the side on inclusion by submitting both tasks two two and three at nearly the same time (42-minute time difference between two and three submittal).  I waited for the tasks notifications and constantly refreshed my “My Portal” homepage like a crack fiend waiting to get the newest crackrock in the 1980s…after 40 hours of waiting for that fix, I received notification that I passed tasks two and three. So if you want to submit at the same time, I recommend doing it while making sure that you write to the rubric ensuring that your shit is squared-away.\\n\\nFinal Words:  I enjoyed the program and the learning opportunities that WGU provides.  I know that people will knock the curriculum and that is okay.  I will tell you that this degree is not a “diploma mill” degree and you will need to be competent to be able to accelerate.  I put a vast amount of effort along with having two little children (four and three years old) and a demanding project management job that requires more time than I am able to bill my company for…hahaha…If you are a student that wants to take its time, feel free to do so.  If this post doesn’t apply, let it fly.  I have seen some post where some redditors get into their feeling about someone posting their experiences to the subreddit.  I am open to hearing from everyone’s experience regarding their journeys and will admit that I am inspired by them.  Believe in yourself and have confidence in your ability to figure things out.  Have a great day!  "

       "      <td>Tips for Accelerating Your MBA (or Not!) - Course Tips &amp; Recommended Resources\\nLet me start by saying this. I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips &amp; Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations &amp; Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&amp;D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I finished this program today in a little over 3 months. I transferred 50 credits and work full time (Non IT). Here are my thoughts. Very long read!\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Proof of Completion](https://preview.redd.it/4372ewij6r5b1.jpg?width=1026&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b92d9611f3e8c135bf5b9ea582ef9d423b96d820)\\n\\n[Completed Progress Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/kcx3uvij6r5b1.jpg?width=1921&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=82c94084e66ec02294d3990bcebe5cc3bfd4c42a)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, there are a lot of grammatical errors in this. I know. I do not care because I’m too lazy to proof read and fix them.\\n\\nAnyways I finished this degree program in a little over 3 months (105 days to be exact) after transferring about 50 credits. I also work full time with some fairly demanding hours. I do not have any professional IT work experience, but I can navigate around a computer. I also just find the subject matter interesting. I did do the computer science program last year and graduated from that in 1 term in August of 2022. My plan was to go to grad school in Spring of 2023, but I ended up missing all my deadlines and had to wait and apply for Summer/Fall Semester of 2023. I did end up getting accepted to University of Illinois (Urbana Campus) Masters in Computer Science (Data Science Track) for Fall of 2023…which was a shocker because it’s a Top 5 school for computer science. Data science has always been my main goal, but I had all this time in between from when I applied to when the Fall semester would start. Cybersecurity was always on my list of things to learn, but I always had other priorities. Now that I had this gap of time that I could do whatever with, it was a good time for me to get into it. I originally thought about going the route of just doing certs because I already have a CS degree, but I would have just mostly done the same certs that WGU offers in their Cybersecurity program. It would have cost a little less than the actual degree, but still roughly in the same ball park if done in 1 term. Considering that I would be attaining the same certs anyways and the cost is comparable, I figure I might as well do the program and get the degree out of it as well, even though I would likely never use the degree on my resume (with exceptions) as CS “trumps” Cybersecurity. At the least, it helped me stay on track and in focus. I gotta be honest, I enjoyed it alot more than I did computer science and it really got me questioning what path I want to take in my future. I’m still going to grad school (it was a miracle that I even got excepted there), but I may defer to next year (University of Illinois allows that) as I’m thinking I want to take Cyber Security further and dive into different areas. Below is a recap of classes that may or may not help you.\\n\\nHowever, before I get into it, I would just like to point out that I have been working in the construction project management field for the last decade after I finished my first stint (of many) in college (civil engineering). Needless to say, those who are in the engineering/construction field live and die by the schedule so I have a habit of making a schedule for every significant (sometimes insignificant) things I do. I included the schedule I made for this program. I started in March and assigned myself durations to complete the entire program within 1 term and giving myself more weight to what classes I thought would be more demanding and vise-versa. This is the schedule that I would live by and you can see I was on track until I did my 4th class (Networks D325) which is when I started accelerating like crazy. The durations shown are my actuals and the grey bars you see in the gantt chart is my baseline schedule snapshot of what my original schedule was when I first made it. You can compare the 2 and see how much I blew my original schedule out of the water. Most of the classes were done much quicker than my projection. Capstone was the only one that took longer (only by 4 days). Seeing a visual of your progress helps keep you on track and is a motivating factor. I would suggest everyone put a schedule together of some sort.\\n\\n**IT Foundations – D316 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I never had a job in IT, I just grew up using a computer just like everyone else in this program. I felt alot of these questions were really basic questions and if you know your way around a computer you can probably answer most of them without heavy studying. That being said, even though it is a basic certification, I feel like I actually got alot out this course as it made me touch on things that I wouldn’t have otherwise yet is still good to know…things like differences between cpu architecture and differences in memory types, etc… stuff you don’t normally think about. I found those things to be quite interesting. The only PBQ I remember was having to simulate putting together 2 desktops, one being high performance and one being for general office use, you have to pick the right components for each desktop based on the parameters in the question. For studying I partially watched the Total Seminar Series to fill in gaps and did a few Messer practice exams. I also did practice questions from crucialexams dot com. That is one of my favorite resources. Check that site out if you do not already know about it. That was all that was needed.\\n\\n**IT Applications – D317 (17 Days…I didn’t actually spend 17 days on this course, I was inactive for 10 days)**\\n\\n\\- Part 2 of the A+ exam. I have a similar view to how I viewed “IT Foundations” (Part 1 of A+ exam). About the same difficulty as Part 1. However, alot of it seemed like it was common sense considering you didn’t just start using a computer yesterday. Many of the questions you can come up with the right answer by just logically using process of elimination. On my particular exam, it was heavy on questions regarding system tools and commands. Those were the things you are really going to want to pay attention to study for. For studying, I mainly only watched the Total Seminar Series and did some Professor Messer exams and crucial exams.\\n\\n**Legal Issues in Information Security – C841 (10 Days…had 1 revision to do)**\\n\\n\\- I didn’t read any course material. I just read what the assignment was and used outside resources to learn and fill any gaps that I had to complete the assignment. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. I had no interest in this class whatsoever and I just blew through the assignment in a few days. I could have certainly spent longer time and get in depth with the course material, but it just was not important to me and I opted to just get this class done as fast as possible. It is a very easy class if you want it to be.\\n\\n**Networks – D325 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Of all classes, this was one the most demanding for me and the most important. Networking is the foundation to everything in this program and it would behoove you take as much time needed to understand the concepts. I would encourage all of you to build some sort of homelab which can be done dirt cheap. Exam wise, it was difficult because of all the acronyms you need to remember which makes it unnecessarily difficult, but the questions themselves were not tricky and fairly straightforward except the PBQs which are nonsensical in how they are asked. In my PBQs I was asked to set up/configure a network and WIFI and was also asked to troubleshoot a network. The questions were pretty comprehensive across the board and there were a few questions on port numbers, OSI model questions (know what layer does what and what types of programs or hardware pertains to each layer), network topography, wireless standards and a bunch of questions on various plans/policies and a bunch of questions on command line utilities (learn these!). I also had maybe 3 questions on CIDR notation, but I did not have to compute anything. Again, know your acronyms! For this test, I watched the total seminar series, practice exams on crucial exams, a couple of Dion practice exams (only partially) and referenced Mike Meyers’ CompTIA Network+ Certification Passport Book. I really liked this book. His “all in one” book goes more in depth (I have it but didn’t read it much), but the Certification Passport book was much better to look up a topic and briefly read about it when going over things you need to go over. Watching the video series and then using this book as a backup was all I really needed. I did a few quick reviews on crucial exams to build some confidence.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity – C844 (3 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read any course material, I just went straight to the assignment and chipped away at it all day. I thought this class was useful as it gave you an introductory on how to use Wireshark and Nmap. Wireshark is a very cool program. Lots of features to analyze traffic. I did not read the course material for this class as the Nmap portion was easy to figure out without having to really look anything up, but for the Wireshark portion, I only watched the Udemy course: “Getting Started with Wireshark: The Ultimate Hands-On Course” by David Bombal. Excellent course and will provide you with all you need. This guy is very passionate about his Wireshark! I highly recommend this Udemy course and get as much as you can out of it. There are others, but this one was the best one that I was able to come across.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications – D329 (7 Days)**\\n\\n\\- This class is the class that requires the Security+. I found this exam to be fairly easy because there is a lot of overlap from Network+. Just like Network+ there is a lot of memorization of acronyms needed. I apologize as I don’t have much to offer on this because I don’t remember the specifics of what was on it. It is just kind of one big blur. I remember it being shockingly easy compared to Network+ like if you passed Network+ you could probably take this the next day and pass it after reviewing all the common types of attacks. For studying, I just watched the Security+ course on udemy by TIA Education, Andrew Ramdayal. He was actually pretty good, straight to the point on topics with no fluff. Probably not everyone’s “cup of tea”. Also, probably could have gone a little more in depth in some areas, but I would take this over Dion Training any day. Hell, I would take anything over Dion Training. Ramdayal strictly sticks to the objectives laid out exactly the way Comptia has their test laid out. It was easy to goto each one and pick the things you need to work on. I did no practice exams. Went straight to the official exam after I finished the video series. I do remember that one of the PBQs was setting up a firewall.\\n\\n**Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity – D431 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read the course material, I just went straight to the assignment and used outside resources and Udemy to guide me. I actually found this course to be quite fun. You will have (2) PAs and an OA to do. The first PA is that you have to create an investigation plan per best practices. The 2nd PA was fun as you will need to run a program called “Autopsy”, where you have to analyze a disk image and put a story together about what crime will likely be committed based on the evidence you found when doing your forensics. As far as the OA goes, know your tools, Windows/Linux/Mac log types and folder locations, what different parts of your Windows registry does and the various Federal Laws (critical). The preassessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty and style. That was really the only study aid I used.\\n\\n**Information Systems Security – C845 (10 Days)**\\n\\nYou will need to pass your SSCP for this one. I wrote a post on this class before. However here is a brief TLDR recap from my previous post on couple of things for you to remember:\\n\\n\\- The SSCP Practice Exam Book by Nick Mitropoulous is a fairly good representation of the exam and is the only thing I used.\\n\\n\\- This was an easier version of Security+. If you passed A+, Net+ and Sec+ than this exam will be fairly easy.\\n\\n\\- questions seem to be spread out evenly across the board for the most part, with the exception that there were very few questions on “cryptography” (I had maybe 5 or 6 that I can remember), but there were seemingly a bunch of questions regarding “identity access”. They weren’t difficult, but that section definitely had the most weight. Be sure you know the concepts behind the “who I am”, “what I know”, “what I have” principles as there were a lot of questions on that.\\n\\n\\- There were no trick questions and you don’t have to worry about remembering acronyms\\n\\n\\- Don’t psych yourself out. The most obvious answers are like the correct answers. There were no trick questions.\\n\\n\\- This is very important, read the question very carefully and really think about your answer when it comes to the “best”, “worst” and “most likely/unlikely” questions. These questions have multiple right answers so they can be kind of difficult. You have to consider how you are answering that question because you will get questions like “What is the best course of action in this (insert scenario)? Choose: A, B, C or D. Lets say the answer “A” and “B” are both definitely correct in the scenario, but choice “B” might be a step that you would do in part of step described in choice “A”. So the answer would be “A”. These are not trick questions, but you really need to think how answers integrate with others to pick the best choice. These questions were probably the most “trickiest”, but if you know to look out for them and think logically, you will be ok\\n\\n**Introduction to Cryptography – D334 (8 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed my first OA attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. Lots of memorization in this class. Just like all the other threads you will see about this course. Shawn’s Course Study Guide/Notes found in course chatter is all you need. The book is ok, but is pretty dry. Shawn did a very good job on his study guide. Its all you need! Get familiar with that and then do his practice exams for each chapter. You will pass. The PA and his practice exams were pretty close to the OA in terms of difficulty and style of question. Lots of memorization. I’m probably in the minority here, but I thought the subject matter was very interesting. I think about this stuff when I download programs and visit websites and stuff. It only took me about a week to finish this class, but I got pretty immersed in it. The concept of cryptography is pretty much engrained in me. Regarding the exam, questions seemed to be more skewed towards PKI, Wireless Encryption Protocols and Tunneling. These seem to show up the most on my exam and there were very few questions on blockchain/crypto currency and lightweight cryptography. The rest of the topics were pretty evenly distributed. It was a good introductory course in my opinion.\\n\\n**Managing Information Security – C843 (4 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Didn’t read any course material. Just read and did the assignment. You will need to do an incident analysis and response as well as a risk assessment. There is a lot of crap you are going to have to discuss and write about, such as legal acts, tools, techniques for gathering and analyzing, examination process etc…. It’s a very annoying assignment. I did not care for it in the slightest.\\n\\n**Cyber Defense and Countermeasures – D340 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- The CYSA+ is required for this class. WGU is enforcing a policy where accelerators can only have one class approved at a time and the program must be taken in a specific order….atleast that is what my mentor told me and won’t budge on it. The reason I’m mentioning this is because the order in which they have you do classes makes sense and does a good job preparing you systematically in my opinion. Every class builds on each other and the time you are required to take the CYSA+ is the right time. That being said, I felt the CYSA+ is a much harder version of the Security+. It went much deeper in security concepts compared to the Sec+ and I found some aspects of it to be rather difficult. However, all the Comptia exams you have taken so far preps you for the CYSA+. The cryptography class taken before this class, covers most of the cryptography questions on this exam. The digital forensics course that we have to take before this was sufficient enough to not have to do in depth studying for this exam. For studying, I just blew through the Total Seminar CYSA+ Series on Udemy and did a quick run through with things I was not familiar with the CYSA+ Certification Passport Book by Bobby Rogers. I did not do any practice exams. My lack of study was due to me being over confident. The PBQs were fun though. From what I remember, they all had to do with using nmap to determine what specific servers did and log trouble shooting. That was pretty much the gist of all the PBQs. They were pretty straight forward. &lt;750 is considered a fail…I passed with a 751 on the first attempt. Probably should have done some practice exams to get that score up a little. Pass is a pass!\\n\\n**Managing Cloud Security – D320 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed this OA by a slim margin the first attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. The instructor for this course was a relief because he just let me do it after I told him I reviewed the book the previous day. Normally they make you do a bulls\\\\\\*\\\\\\*t generic study plan and make you jump through a bunch hoops. Apparently the course was redone and a new exam had been made following the CCSP text book. This test was a doozy as there are 125 questions. However, just going over the book is sufficient. It was for me anyways. A lot of it will be a review which makes studying quite quick. It followed the book quite nicely. There were no curve balls and the questions were pretty straight forward. I’d probably say that the most sh\\\\\\*tty thing was having to memorize the various laws and frameworks. This is a must! You also need to make sure you are familiar with all the different frameworks and standards, quantitative risk assessment, uptime institute, data lifecycle, SOC report types, Software Development Lifecycle and Stride Threat Model.\\n\\n**Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis – D332 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\* This is taken from a previous post I made after I finished this class. Im reposting it here so you don’t have to search for it.\\*\\n\\n\\- By far the most difficult exam in my opinion. This was the only Comptia test that I failed the first time. All the Comptia exams kind of built off the previous and you could make your way around the exams without feeling completely lost. Pentest+ was different, the previous exams will help you very little. The things you really have to know are the commonly used tools and what they do. There is a lot of them and there are bunch of questions like “which tool would use for this?”. NMAP commands and syntax (very heavy in this), SQL Injection/XSS types and deciphering vulnerability logs. Make sure you have a semi decent grasp on SQL in general. ALL the different types of attacks that are commonly used. There are some that came up that I did not come across in the book. If you know the main/commonly used ones, you should be ok for the most part. Learn scripting! You will not need to write any per se, but you might as well learn because there are questions where you need to decipher/interpret various scripts and therefore need to know how to write them. Make sure you know the different syntax. For example, know how an array is written in PowerShell (there is a question in the exam where you will need to figure this out). Learn the common commands for PS, Bash and Linux. There was a couple questions having to do with common HTTP methods. There were not really any questions regarding the different laws. Definitely do not need to focus on that. You should know them anyways if you had just done the Managing Cloud class. The PBQs were medium difficulty. From what I remember, they were as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n1. Mix and match: You will get like a single line of script (or payloads rather) and you have to pick what kind of vulnerability it is and then you need to pick a method of remediation. Need to know your scripting and various types of SQL injection. This is critical. There will be like (10) of these you have to do.\\n\\n2. Scripting: On the right, there will be a block of incomplete scripting. On the left, you will have multiple options of code snippets that you will need to use to plug into the incomplete areas of the code. The code is prewritten for you. You just need to place the right snippet in the correct blank spot where the code is incomplete. There are twice as many code snippets then there are blank spots so you can’t just use the process of elimination. You kind of have to have some sort of clue. Also, the code might be in Bash, Python or Ruby. You have to be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n3. NMAP Interpretation: You will get a block of an NMAP scan result. Like above, you will have a bunch of options on the right hand side. You will be asked to put together the correct NMAP command to get the results shown in the scan output. Part 2 is that you will need to also pick the trouble areas (attack vectors) based on what the scan shows. There will be a list of options for you to choose from.\\n\\n4. Investigate Login Page: You will be given a login page of which you can view the certificate, source code and cookies. You will need to determine if any of those 3 things have issues. If they do, you will need to specify and provide a solution.\\n\\nThe Sybex book is by far the best book for this course. I did not care for the Sybex books in the other courses. Finding a good video series was difficult. I’m a total seminars fan, but this one did not do it for me. I hate the Dion materials in general and I’ve tried others on Udemy and Youtube and none of them were doing it for me. Another great book is Pentest+ for dummies. Very engaging. Lastly, you must spend time and do labs to understand the concepts. You’re really shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t. Look into tryhackmeDOTcom as well. I took the exam 3 days after registering for the class after a quick review. I thought I would be ok and I wanted to quickly get it over with. I found out in the first 10 questions and the PBQs that I was very underprepared. I took the test again a week later after intense studying and passed.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project – C769 (9 Days)**\\n\\nEh, it is what it is. A bunch of busy work. No need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look in WGUs database that has\\n\\nall the previous capstones that were rewarded for “excellence” and look at them for inspiration, ideas and see how they put theirs together. There is also a dedicated capstone page that will provide templates and samples for you so you will not be totally lost. I chose to propose implementing an “Insider Threat Management System” for a pharmaceutical company based on a scenario that I made up. There are 3 parts to the capstone: submitting what you will propose, writing the actual proposal and writing a post implementation report/reflection. None of it is difficult, it is just time consuming as they are asking for you to include a lot of stuff. 70% of part 3 is going to ask you for the same thing in part 2. I literally just cut and pasted the applicable sections from part 2 and changed the wording to past tense as part 3 is supposed to occur after you implemented your system. There will be a portion where you have to use outside references and cite books or whatever…just goto researchgateDOTcom query whatever subject you’re doing, pick however many you need from the search results that pertain and just read the abstracts and tie them into your proposal and cite them (already provided when you select a paper to view). This should save you some time. You are also going to need to turn in some sort of “deliverable” whether it be code sample, UML diagrams, operations manual, etc… I would suggest just doing a simple process diagram and explain each process. Its quick and easy and satisfies that requirement. If you goto apps dot diagrams dot net, you can build a nice one for free. If you want to be ultra creative and spend all your time doing the capstone on some crazy and innovative idea, all good. However, I would suggest you put in the bare minimum effort and move on, finish this program and get started on your new career asap. I WOULD NOT put any effort into this capstone! WGU doesn’t require it (they are just looking that you have all the things in their rubric). This project is not beneficial in any way and its not like you would be using it for a portfolio or anything. Do not waste your time on it. Read the requirements make sure you include those requirements and go.\\n\\n**List of exams from least difficult to most difficult:**\\n\\n1. A+ part 2\\n\\n2. A+ part 1\\n\\n3. SSCP\\n\\n4. Intro to Cryptography OA (Not difficult, but lots of memorization)\\n\\n5. Security+\\n\\n6. Managing Cloud Security OA (Due to amount of questions and material needed to go over)\\n\\n7. CYSA+\\n\\n8. Network+ (Information overload and acronyms galore!)\\n\\n9. Pentest+ (read review!)\\n\\n\\*I am awaiting to take the CCSP. I will be taking it in 2 weeks. I do not know how difficult it will be. Can’t be that hard. I’ll provide a writeup when I do take it\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2 things that may or may not help you…**\\n\\n1. There is a lot of information on the internet about how to study. Reading the text book through and through and taking notes is not efficient nor is it the best way and it is what is called “passive learning”. It is more efficient to do active learning. Which means…well…do active things when you’re learning…flash cards, practice exams, simulate teaching the material, physical home lab, etc…\\n\\nWhen it comes to studying especially for exams, my normal study habit is to watch a video series on 2x the speed or the fastest it can be where I can clearly understand it. You are trying to get an overview and have familiarity with everything. The video is visual and helps things stick. You’ll be surprised how much you can pick up. I will not take notes, just jot down questions of things I need to go over as they come up while I am watching. When Im done with the series, I will then look those question topics up and determine the what, why, and how of it to understand that particular topic/concept. Then I will generally do a practice exam, note question topics that I am not familiar with to look up when done. I will also go over the questions missed and then repeat then go over the same or another practice exam. It doesn’t matter if the test is not that similar in style/difficulty to what you are taking if you take the time to understand the concept. Comprehensive practice exams is my preference but anything that is “active” is good. You will figure out what works best for you. Just don’t read a book front to back, take notes in between and try to memorize it unless you like being inefficient and wasting your time…unless that is what is best for you. Lol\\n\\n2. Most of you already know this, but ChatGPT is your friend! By far the most valuable tool for me. It can be abused or it can be used as an extremely well-functioning learning tool. You are only hurting yourself if you want to try and use it for other purposes. When I would study my material and need to understand a topic like OSI models for example, I would write something like “Explain to me like a child what the OSI layers are and what they do. Also provide me an analogy.”. I cannot tell you how easy it was for me to pick things up when Chatgpt was able to explain things to me like im a 5 year old and provide me an easy to understand analogy. Analogies was a game changer for me. If you still don’t understand, you can have full conversations with it and ask it questions until you do understand it. Something like “I don’t understand, why would it do \\\\\\*this when it seems to do \\*that? You said \\*this. What is difference between \\*this and \\*that?”! Like full on conversations. Try it right now and see what I’m talking about! Use it to your advantage for learning. It is an amazing resource! Word of caution though, it is not always right depending on what you are asking or telling it what to do so when in doubt verify it.\\n\\n**My thoughts overall:**\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking: “ MmMMMmGoOoOo! BuT, bUt, BuT, YoU JuSt RuShEd ThRoUgH iT aNd DiD NoT LeArN AnyThInG! mMmGoOoOoOo!”. I learned the amount of material I needed to learn to get through the entire program and have probably come out with just as much as everyone else who graduated regardless of time spent. More than others in some cases. I also feel like I have a gotten a very solid foundation out of it, which was my expectation. \\n\\nHere is the thing, I would rather blow through the program and pay minimum tuition of $4k (plus get all my bonus certs!), continue learning and fill in gaps after completion at my leisure vs taking my sweet time and pump out the program in 3-4 terms and pay $12k-$16k. I guarantee I will have far surpassed that person’s knowledge on an intellectual and practical level by the time he/she is done. My learning will never stop, but my tuition will as soon as I can make it stop! Time is money. Massive acceleration is the way to go if it can be done…in my opinion. That is the beauty of WGU.\\n\\nThat being said, I feel like I’m just beginning, in that I’ve only dipped my toe and now the real learning begins. Now that I have the time and am not at the mercy of my term date lest I pay another 4k, I will go back and fill in my gaps and really start doing real world practical stuff and labs that I did not do. I did build a pretty intricate homelab that I will be using heavily. Anyways, I feel like this program did an excellent job in providing a solid foundation and I do mean excellent. I do not regret it in any way and I am in many ways more excited about this then I was with the Computer Science degree. That’s all I got. Good luck to you all!

Review of all classes.\\nThere are others that have made this post, but I think it would be helpful if people gave context to who they are and their level of proficiencies so that others can more accurately predict how the experience will go for them.\\n\\n  \\n**Who I am:**\\n\\n*  Early 30s male\\n* Wife and kid (toddler)\\n* Working full time while doing the degree in an unrelated field (High school AP physics teacher)\\n* No prior work experience in the tech field\\n* Did a Udemy course about 2 months before enrollment, which taught basic programming (Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python... and I did about 20 days of that and had never coded before)\\n* Have always had a strong interest in tech and computers as a USER. Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.

       "      <td>My Fun 41-Day MBA Journey - SO WORTH IT!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\*This is about my MBA journey, I hope to inspire, but don't be hard on yourself if your accelerated path is different\\*\\n\\nI was highly motivated and inspired by the post I read in this Reddit group from Sleyk2010, along with many other accelerators in this group and a few FB groups. Before I chose WGU for my MBA, I had my share of skepticism. I looked at numerous online and Brick and Mortar schools (I received my Bachelor’s from a traditional B&amp;M University). I completed my BSBM in a little over two years for a 5-year program (about 18 months ago), so I was already used to acceleration. I could have accelerated my Bachelor’s degree even more, but of course, I could only go as fast as the university allowed. I had to go the full 6 or 8 weeks for a course, even if I completed all of my exams, papers, and reading ahead of time. This led to me doubling and tripling my course load each semester. What drew me to WGU was that I CAN DICTATE MY PATH. I knew that I had a hunger for reading books, writing papers, and retaining the coursework. I am just maniacal like that, so I don’t expect everybody to feel the way I do about school. I knew I could crush my goals through acceleration because I know myself well enough and have been able to do it in the past. School is actually fun for me and if that makes me weird or crazy, I will proudly own that, lol.\\n\\nAll of this being said, everyone approaches school at their own individual pace and I am not writing this to declare that everybody will complete their Master’s degree in a matter of weeks or a few months. Everyone’s motivation is also not the same and how a person approaches school impacts how they set their pace. There is no way to “cheat” a degree. Everyone gets the SAME courses and the same coursework. Less than 10% of students accelerate at a pace where they can achieve their degree in well under one term/semester. The norm is that students will take two terms or more. Be clear that it IS TOTALLY OKAY. There is no “correct amount of time” to finish a degree. It is totally up to you based on your motivation, the time you dedicate to it, and your ability to absorb the coursework.  No matter how quickly you finish, be proud that you finished and that it took some hard work to get there.\\n\\nSo, let me get to the fun part. The Reddit and Facebook groups are helpful and great motivators for those who decide to come to WGU. It is a great school, properly accredited, and VERY reputable. WGU is also very relevant for the working adult and career-minded individuals who want to advance their careers. I am laying out a full course-by-course write-up of how I approached each course and how I successfully passed it. Let me be clear, this is how I did it and what worked for me, so by no means will this be a blanket approach that works for everyone. It is a lot of hard work and some frustrating days will be ahead, but trust me, obtaining your MBA is doable if you stay focused and put in the work. I don’t have any “tricks,” no rubrics, no papers to use for sampling, and no study guides to pass along. For the sake of academic integrity, I won’t risk myself or anyone putting a stain on the school or me for giving people the easy way out. If I had to do the work, so do you. I am offering some guidance and motivation for students in the program. Hopefully, acceleration will work well for you all too!!!!\\n\\nAgain, I don’t have any work to pass along, so please don’t inquire. If anyone feels the need to minimize and discredit accelerators, keep that negative energy somewhere because accelerators are the exception, not the norm, so this is NOT easy. As you will see many accelerators say, they will not apologize for busting their ass to obtain their degree faster than others. Some people are brainiacs, some are overachievers, and some are both. That is not a bad thing. Also, some Program Mentors are better than others and will be supportive of your path. My mentor was AWESOME and I came in with a game plan and strategy that she backed me up on. I made it clear that I was accelerating and would NOT be in the program longer than 45 days because I am on a mission. I am maniacal in my approach and putting in 40 hours or more a week outside of work to do schoolwork is not a problem for me. I can rest when I finish my degree. I do not suggest this for everyone. Plus, I have an empty nest with all my adult children out on their own. I had some downtime at work and figured no time was better than the present to get my MBA and advance my career. I will start with the Three Commandments of WGU, which I will cite as a source courtesy of SLEYK2010 himself (which are great by the way!!)\\n\\n*“The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.”*\\n\\n***To add as an addendum to the commandments, use Grammarly or some type of paper editing application for your papers. They will eliminate grammar and spelling errors on all of your papers. It is your best friend. Also, use Quizlet, they have very useful study guides to use for the courses.***\\n\\n**\\*Disclaimer\\* This is not the order I TOOK the courses in, they are in numerical order. My game plan was to do all of the PA (writing courses) first and switch my brain over to the analytical courses next (ones with OAs). I did C213 and C214 Back-toBack because there was a lot of cross-over between the two courses. I  saved C215 and C207 for last because of the cross-over and because I wanted to close out with the OA and PA course (C207).**\\n\\n**On to the courses!!!**\\n\\n**ORA1** – **Orientation** – One PA\\n\\nDo what you feel is best for the orientation. If you have done a lot of research on the academic program before orientation opens up, this “course” won’t be tedious. Follow the rubric, keep it simple, and peruse the “coursework.” It simply gives an overview of what to expect as a student and ensures that you are prepared to start your program. Be as realistic as you can be when asked about how much of a time commitment you can truly make each week to your schoolwork.\\n\\n**C200** – **Managing Organizations and Leading People** \\- Two OAs (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nYou will start with what is called the “Signature Themes Assessment.” It does not take hella long to do and when you complete it, save the PDF. Task #1 is a paper centered around the assessment that you took. PLEASE FOLLOW THE RUBRIC when you write the paper. Task #2 focuses on leadership that you experienced in your career. It can be a past or present company. You won’t be able to use actual names for the company or the person (or people) that you write about. Have fun with it, the assignment will be about your life experiences, so it will be easy to speak to either way. I finished both papers in one day, I just got diarrhea of the brain and my hands did the rest. This is one course where I will say that even though there is some reading that is available, it won’t be of much use. The readings are pretty much common sense type of stuff and won’t make much of an impact on the papers that you have to write in this course. Just get straight to writing and have fun with it.\\n\\n**C202** – **Managing Human Capital** – One OA (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nThis class was pretty straightforward in my eyes. I assume we are all adults here and have been a part of a workplace environment that involved employee interaction. A lot of common sense and work experience type of content is in this course. The technical aspects of this course (terminology and concepts) are in the reading materials and there is a Quizlet (get acquainted with this site, it is VERY helpful) that is very helpful for the course. I did some of the reading, but a lot of it was stuff I covered extensively in undergrad, so I didn’t have to deep dive into the reading materials. This is the Human Resources course of the MBA program. I took the pre-assessment and reviewed my weak areas. I skimmed the readings and reviewed a few Quizlets to help me prepare for the OA. It took me about two days total to do the reading, study, and pass the OA. Again, the course is not a beast, you will know more about the course than you will think. Some people may take longer to get through the course and trust me, THAT IS OKAY.\\n\\n**C204** – **Management Communication** – Three PAs -Two Papers and One PPT&amp;Video (Another Straightforward and Easy Course) \\n\\nThis course was actually a lot of fun. Tedious, but easy enough. There are some reading materials for this course, but honestly, they don’t provide much help for the actual tasks. I skimmed the materials to see what use I could make of them, but I was able to dive right into the tasks. Task #1 is a paper, but it will be constructed in a weird manner. The course is about professional communication in the workplace. You will be writing emails from the perspective of being a business owner or a supervisor. You will be writing emails to your staff, a business partner, and the stakeholders. The three emails will be fun to make, so don’t overthink the assignment.  Task #2 is a Powerpoint and Video. WGU uses Panopto for video creation. If you have never used it before (most of us probably have not), they provide instructional videos on how to use it. You should have access to Panopto as a student, but if you don’t, reach out to the IT department, and they will rectify that for you pretty quickly, usually within 24 hours. The video only needs to cover the points in the rubric and your PPT should be an outline of the presentation. Mine took over 15 minutes, but I am a classroom trainer by trade, so it was in my wheelhouse. Most people can truly do their presentation in less than 10 minutes. Follow the rubric to ensure you cover all the points they want you to cover and you will be fine. Task 3 is an executive summary. A one-page paper and you are good to go. All three tasks can be done by jumping in head first while the reading materials provide just a little help for the papers. I was able to complete all three tasks over two days.\\n\\n**C206** – **Ethical Leadership** – Three PAs (Straightforward but VERY tedious course)\\n\\nI did not personally find this class to be “hard,” but it is very labor-intensive. This course is similar to C200 in that you will be using another assessment called the “Ethical Lens Inventory” to start you off before your first task. There are 3 PAs and they are a doozy, lol. I honestly had fun with this class because I had a few ethics courses in undergrad and had to apply them in real life at work. The reading materials are enlightening and helpful but don’t be intimidated by any of the reading. A lot of the reading is stuff you have previously or currently face in your workplace and your life. I had a LOT of ammo to use for these papers, so the writing was pretty easy for me. Task #1 is to write about a leader you admire, a leader you know, or a famous leader. It does not matter; just make sure you cite any sources if you use someone you don’t know personally. Task #2 is focused on social responsibility, ethics in the workplace, and ethical leaders. You may find that your work experiences will be very useful for this paper. Life experiences can be the best teacher. Task 3 is a paper about leadership and the code of ethics. All three tasks will include life experiences and ethics concepts, so the reading materials are helpful. PLEASE make sure you follow the rubric to the letter for each task because it can be easy to miss a section and have your paper sent back for revision. I spent one day reading the materials a bit and two days doing the papers. Three days total. I wrote over 15 pages for each task, but trust me, many of you can do them in 10 pages, give or take a page. I do like to write, so I tend to write with extensive details, but if you like to keep things simple and just answer each section in a rubric, DO THAT. Writing a novel is not necessary, lol. I did get two excellence awards for 2 of the tasks I wrote for this course, so the long ass days of writing were worth it for me.   \\n\\n**C207** – **Data-Driven Decision Making** \\- Two PAs and One OA (Hard course for most, not very straightforward)\\n\\nIf any of you have read up on this class on Reddit or Facebook, you will see that this class beats people up. I can understand why it does. This is the Statistics class of the program. No real reading materials are provided for this course, which is why I say it is not so straightforward. There are TONS of PPTs and videos from the course instructors for this course. USE THEM. I personally love statistics and data, so I didn’t feel intimidated by the class. There is not a lot of math used in this course, it is heavy on concepts and statistical methods. Again, there are tons of resources in the course from the CIs, such as videos, study guides, and PPTs. Review them multiple times if you have to until you start to comprehend the material. Reach out to a CI if you need assistance, they are there to help. Quizlet is also helpful for the OA in this course because you will be using a lot of terminology. For task #1, you are forming a hypothesis that you will have to analyze for task #2. Once the evaluators approve task #1, you can move to task #2. The course will provide the framework for all the statistical methods you can use for your hypothesis. Most people chose a T-Test or ANOVA. I chose linear regression. I only chose it because it made more sense for my hypothesis. Use a topic you are familiar with for your hypothesis, it will make the task less painful. I used home values and mortgage rates because I work in the financial world, but I easily could have used sports for a topic too. For task #2, they provide videos and PPTs for each test that you perform and will show you how to input them in Excel. You will need at least 30 data points to use for the assignment but trust me, once you gather the info, it gets easier from there. Once you run the analysis in Excel, you will be writing a short paper (probably no more than 5 or 6 pages) that covers about 6 or 7 bullet points. As always, follow the rubric and keep it simple. For the OA, they provide a pretty good study guide and flashcards for the terminology, but Quizlet is an excellent supplement for this as well. The pre-assessment does not align heavily with the OA, but use it as a starting point for the areas that you do need to cover for the OA. My Program Mentor let me push this class to the end before the Capstone because I wanted to follow the Operations Management course (there is a lot of crossover between the courses). I honestly had fun with this class because I love Stats and Math (I am a math tutor on the side), so I didn’t lose my mind in the course. It took me about five days to read and watch the course materials, do the tasks, study, and pass the OA. Realistically, this course can easily take many weeks for people to complete and that is okay. It is not easy for most and you truly want to comprehend and retain what you learn in the course. \\n\\n**C211** – **Global Economics for Managers** – One PA (Somewhat hard course for most)\\n\\nMany people have stated this course kicked their butt and I can see why. There is a lot of technical stuff to cover in this course and if you are not a fan of economics or did not cover it much in undergrad, this class will be brutal. For me, I like this type of stuff and still use a lot of the micro and macro Econ knowledge I learned in undergrad, especially being in the financial industry. There are reading materials, study guides, videos, and PPTs available for this course and they are very helpful materials to use. Focus on the areas where you are the weakest because you don’t want to be in the dark in important areas that you don’t know. There are a lot of terms and concepts that you need to know and the study guides are very helpful in covering what you need to know. Use Quizlet too, it supplements the course material tremendously. There are helpful YouTube videos for Econ as well, so just know that there are many ways to skin a cat here to find helpful information. The pre-assessment somewhat aligns with the OA, so spot your weak areas and drill those down before the OA. I felt the class was not hard for me because of what I came into the class with, but I know that this class can be a lot of work for many. It is not a race; take as much time as you need to understand the course. It took me about three days to complete the course, but just try to get as much as you can out of the course and do it at your pace.   \\n\\n**C212** – **Marketing** – One HUGE PA (Straightforward and somewhat easy course)\\n\\nThis course was easy in terms of understanding the materials but the final paper is long as hell. You really have to APPLY what you learn in the course. I still remembered many marketing concepts from my Bachelor’s program, so I didn’t have to spend far too much time in the book. The concepts are easy to understand and there is no test, so just dig around a little bit in the reading materials for information that you need. There is no way to sugarcoat this, the paper is very long. It will likely be the longest individual paper you write in the program. With that being said, try to have fun with the paper. Many of the areas you have to cover on the rubric are based on your opinion of what you would do if you made marketing decisions for a business. Some of the technical stuff is in the readings, but a good portion of the paper is based on what you would do to market a business. My paper was about 20 pages, but I didn’t feel it was brutal. All in, I completed the course in 2 days. The writing was a lot, but not painful. \\n\\n**C213** \\- **Accounting for Decision Makers** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most, but reasonable)\\n\\nThis course is very technical and if you aren’t familiar with accounting, it may beat you up a little bit. However, if you have any accounting knowledge from your bachelor’s programs, this course will not feel so brutal. Being the nerdy dork that I am, I think accounting is fun. I still retained a lot of what I learned from undergrad and apply it in real life because I do my own accounting for my side business. I still got a lot out of the class and brushed up on concepts that I had learned before, so the class was not hard for me. With all of this being said, there are reading materials (especially the Hawaiian shirt guy who had a video at the end of each chapter) and a few other videos and study guides in the course. The materials are very helpful, trust me. YouTube even has a few basic accounting videos (just like YouTube has for Economics) that are useful. Whatever you do, just make sure you find materials that help you understand accounting concepts effectively. There is a lot of technical work to nail down for the OA and you will want to know and understand basic accounting concepts. There is hardly any math on the OA, and the minimal math used is not hard. Know your debits and credits, the accounting formula, and understand accrual accounting. Quizlet is also a useful tool to supplement the course materials. The course only took me two days to complete and pass the OA, but that is because I already knew the material and could grasp the new stuff. This is a course you may find will be useful in the future, so try to get something out of the class, no matter if it takes you weeks to get through it. Use the CIs if you are struggling because some of the concepts may initially feel foreign.\\n\\n**C214** – **Financial Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most)\\n\\nI won’t sugar coat it, this course is not as fun for me as the rest, lol. I don’t mind finance as a whole, it is just sooooo tedious. If you don’t have a finance calculator (I have had one for many years), make sure you get one. The preferable calculator to use is the TI-30 BAII. If you use any other kind of calculator, you are asking for your life to be filled with agony. Learn the basic functions of the calculator. The course provides a good video on how to use it as well as YouTube. However you do it, just make sure you know how to use the bloody thing. The great thing about this course is that the pre-assessment and the OA will provide all of the formulas that you need to use. You don’t have to remember the formulas, but you do need to know how to apply them and plug them into the calculator. This PA has much more math than the OA, so you will want to focus more on the concepts of Finance and how they apply to the real world. This course has some VERY helpful study guides, PPTs, and videos from the CIs. Quizlets are also very useful. Watch those darn videos 100 times if you have to until it sticks. You will not want to skate through this course, many people fail the OA, and many fail more than once. You can’t BS through this course, you will need to use the materials to grasp the concepts and enlist the help of a CI if you truly get stuck. The math part of the class was the easy part for me, I spent more time focusing on the application of finance principles and that was very fulfilling. I was able to learn things that I did not cover in my finance course in undergrad. I completed the course and passed the OA in a total of 4 days, but I came in with a pretty good foundation that really helped me retain the stuff I learned in the course. Remember, GO AT YOUR PACE. Once you feel confident about the materials, take that OA and put it behind you. \\n\\n**C215** – **Operations Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard Course)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I like this course the least, lol. The main reason is that I was not as passionate about the material. With that being said, I got the most out of this course. I learned a hell of a lot. There is quite a bit of cross-over with C207 because the manufacturing industry utilizes a lot of statistical methods (like Six Sigma, Lean, etc.).  I studied my ass off in this class and completing it was the most fulfilling. The reading materials are helpful, but they are dense and probably more dry than most of the reading. The study guides in the course from the CIs, Quizlet, and some of the reading from the book got me through the class. It is honestly that simple. The materials are there, they are straightforward, they apply to the OA, and they are tools to help you succeed in the course. It took about five days to learn the materials, study, and pass the OA. This course tends to stop people in their tracks and they drag through this class for over a month or more. Don’t be scared of the course. Dive in, learn the material, and don’t stop and start the course to drag it out. That is how you lose your momentum and the course ends up feeling sluggish. Operations Management will be very good material to retain and for people in factories or other manufacturing fields, you will be very comfortable with the coursework. I will also add that this course is one of the most important courses to use as a foundation for the Capstone.\\n\\n**C216** – **MBA Capstone** – Three PAs - PPT &amp; Video, One Huge Paper, and 3-part final task (Very Tedious Course but soooooo much fun)\\n\\nWoohoo!!!!! You made it to the end!!!! You will now apply all the valuable teachings from your other courses and roll them all into the Capstone. The Capstone is centered around a Marketplace Business Simulation. You will be the owner and decision-maker of a business and have six total quarters to make sound business decisions and get a simulation score of at least 0.001 or higher. If you fail, you have the take the simulation all over again. Trust me, you do not want to be set back because of that. Before you do the simulation, it wouldn’t hurt to read the Conscious Capitalism articles they provide. There is no book for the course, just the articles. The CIs provide videos on how to do each task and they may be helpful for each of you to use when figuring out how to structure your presentation and paper. Now, on to the Simulation. You are going to do the simulation for three quarters and pause. You will assess your business and review your decisions so far (you cannot go back and change them once you submit the quarter). Do all of Quarter 4, but do NOT submit it (or else you will make your life hell and screw up the simulation for yourself). Once you complete (but not submit) Quarter 4, it is time to do the PPT and video presentation for task #1. You are a business owner and should act as such, so wear some business casual clothes for your Panopto presentation. You are giving an update of the business through Q4 and telling stakeholders your business plan while asking for more money to invest for the next few quarters. Don’t stress over the PPT, the course provides a template for the presentation PPT and you just have to fill in the relevant information from your business. Most people can do their presentation in 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes. Mine was 40 minutes, but that is because I live for classroom teaching and presentations. It is fun and I definitely overdid it. Once you complete Task #1 and submit it, NOW you can go in and submit Quarter 4. You have to submit task #1 before you do that so the evaluators can go in and open the final two quarters. Now you will work on completing Quarters 5 and 6. My best advice is to be a conscious business. Your decisions should be centered around that because that is what this is all about, right? You can get a jump on task #3 while you wait for task #1 to be reviewed. Task #3 is a reflection paper on what you have learned in the MBA program, make a S.M.A.R.T. goal, how it will be used for your future career path, and include “career and education artifacts.” You will also submit your LinkedIn profile. The rubric will break it all down for you. You can easily complete task #3 in a few hours with the paper and the gathering of your artifacts. Beware though, you CAN NOT submit task #3 until you have completed AND submitted task #2. Just keep it on ice until you submit task #2 and submit task #3 a minute later.  Once you complete all six quarters, you will review your business results in Quarter 7. From this point, you will gather everything you need for the final paper in task #2. Task #2 will be long (mine was 20 pages), but there will be screenshots of graphs and other charts included, so it will not be 100% written words, lol. Follow the trusty rubric and just rock out that last huge paper. You ran the business and made all the decisions, so you will have all of the intimate details of the simulation and will be the best person to speak on it, so own it and tell your story! Whew! Submit task #2, then submit task #3 and wait for the last evaluations of the MBA program.   The Capstone took me about nine days.\\n\\nThe MBA program took me 41 days, but I feel if I didn’t have to go out of town a few times, give myself a couple of days of rest, and not lose a day to revise a task (Task #3 of the Capstone, my silly self did not upload one of my artifacts), I would have completed it in less than 30. I will still take it though and I am very proud that I still crushed my goal.\\n\\nOnce everything is graded and you get confirmation that your final task passed, you can now scream to the world….. YOU ARE AN MBA GRAD!!!!!! \\n\\nSoak in the moment, celebrate your achievement, thank your mentor(who will submit you for graduation), thank your family and friends who have been in your corner, and pat yourself on the back for what you accomplished. Then, wait about 7-10 days for the WGU Owl and Confetti to appear on your WGU profile page, which will officially confirm you are a grad and can no longer access your courses. The road is not easy and some may take longer to get to the finish line than others, but once you finish, you are a winner. No one will be able to take it away from you!!!\\n\\nGO OWLS!!! Remember, you can do it with effort and motivation too :-)\\n\\nON TO THE MSML WHEN MY NEXT TERM BEGINS!!!!!!!</td>\n",

       "      <td>Success Story - 60k IT job 1 week after graduation!!! 1.5 terms nothing to FT Job Offer. Full accelerated-BSIT Write Up\\n**Intro**  \\nHi Night Owls! I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and I've been here since the summer of 2023. I'm a 22y/o based out of the east coast (US). WGU changed my life. In this post I'm going to share my story and the result of 18 months of hard work! I'm also going to provide you guys with the best tips and pieces of information I've gathered from countless hours of researching the job market, reading r/resumes and other related subreddits, news articles, interviews, etc. I'm making this post as a way of reflecting on the past 2 years of my life and to give back to the community by sharing information &amp; my story. My DMs are open for anybody who has questions or would just like to chat!\\n\\n**Background**  \\nI was working as a security guard before WGU and I had a lot of free-time at work to spend on my laptop. I knew I wanted a degree but couldn't afford the tuition and didn't like the idea of graduating much later than my friends I went to HS with. WGU offered me a solution to both of these problems, and I was able to complete a LOT of school work during work hours (I had explicit permission from my manager). This was an amazing opportunity for me because I still lived at home with my parents and was being paid between $17-20/hr to complete school work. If this sounds like something that interests you, I encourage you to apply to Securitas, Allied Universal, GardaWorld, or Prosegur. Look for \"warm body\" sites- locations where you're paid to just sit at a desk in an empty building. Overnight and weekend jobs are great for this sort of thing as well. A good resource for getting into the security industry is r/securityguards. You won't need to carry a firearm if that's a concern of yours. Also, be advised, some states require you to have a security guard license. Personally I didn't have to.\\n\\nI knew I wanted to study IT so choosing which degree program to enroll in wasn't difficult for me. I chose to do the accelerated BSIT-&gt;MSITM program and had a clear idea in mind of the career path I wanted to take. I cannot overstate the importance of doing research on career trajectories from different degrees. The [WGU website](https://www.wgu.edu/) does a decent job of providing degree and career information from whichever degree you choose, but the WGU website alone is simply not enough. Interview/talk with people in the field you're interested in, possibly shadow them, start projects of your own- it is entirely your responsibility to create a plan going into this. Changing your degree program later down the road is completely acceptable but do understand the consequences associated with that (time, money, etc). On a separate note, it's a good idea to organize your school materials and whatnot prior to starting. I created a free [Notion](http://www.notion.com) to keep track of my schedule, save informative Reddit posts and other course materials, track my progress, create reminders, store documents, etc. Another benefit of learning Notion and using it was that I was able to put this tool on my resume.\\n\\n**Pre-WGU**  \\nI took as many courses on [Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) that I possibly could, prior to officially enrolling. I'm not entirely sure if things are the same with Sophia nowadays but when I did it, all of the courses/tests were unproctored and open-book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you do Sophia courses. I didn't do [SDC](https://study.com/) and personally I don't recommend it because their courses can take a while. [This resource](https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines) outlines what you can transfer in, for each WGU degree. I also transferred in the CompTIA A+, N+, S+ (these three certifications together are commonly referred to as the trifecta), because I already had them. WGU will pay for attempts for certifications if they are *required* for your degree program. I used to have a good transfer guide saved but I'm not sure what happened to it; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1390mx6/bsit_im_still_waiting_on_my_transfer_eval_of_my/) might be a helpful resource as well. Also, before you officially enroll, make sure to buy a webcam for the OAs. I use the Webcam 1000 which is what WGU recommends. It plugs into my laptop and works great. I've heard of other people buying one that has a tripod, so do some research and get whichever is best for you. Despite the scary proctoring stories you might read on this subreddit, I've never had any bad experiences myself. YMMV\\n\\nYou get assigned a Program Mentor before your start date. Mine has been extremely helpful and respectful of my preferred communication style and needs. I have seen reddit posts where people complain about their mentors- them wanting to schedule too many meetings, not opening classes, etc. This might be a good [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/16ybsoq/can_i_request_to_change_my_mentor_what_is_your/).\\n\\n**WGU**  \\nMy start date was October 1, 2023. I was able to complete 13 courses in my first term (a term is a 6 month period). I definitely recommend looking up the course code in this subreddit (ex: C268) to find resources. Here is some helpful information about the courses that stand out to me:\\n\\nC268 - This was the 4th class I had, and the real first challenge for me. I think it's like a meme in the WGU-IT community that we've all used [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pf6syi/c268_spreadsheets_video/) to help us pass. &lt;15hrs of studying.\\n\\nC962 - This class was the most amount of writing I've had to do in my undergrad. You'll enjoy this class if you like reading, researching, and finding a great quote to support your writing. I think I wrote my paper about AI or wearable technology or something. This class was &lt;25 hrs of work.\\n\\nC773 - I enjoyed this class a lot. This is an [exceptional resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1f12w4e/summary_user_interface_design_c773_passed_in_6/)\\n\\nD333 - I passed this exemplary on my first attempt but a lot of people have trouble with this class. I think that most of the names of the laws you have to memorize are self-explanatory. [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1d2f20e/d333_finished_in_3_days_passed_first_try_heres_how/)reddit post helped me formulate a strategy for studying for the exam, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/zhy5l8/d333_ethics_in_technology_updated_class_version/) post provides a lot of good learning material.\\n\\nThe CompTIA trifecta can be studied through [free courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/tcqdwh/guys_please_remember_that_wgu_gives_you_a_lot_of/) through udemy (all WGU students get a free udemy account). FWIW, I quit my security guard job around this time because I was offered an unpaid internship at my friend's dad's company. I'll talk more about this later.\\n\\nMy second term was from April 1 - Sept 30, and I was able to complete 3 courses (10 CUs):\\n\\nC954 - I spent a week straight in the library studying for this. Imo, this class is on par with the CompTIA A+ in terms of just how much course material there is. [This](https://onlinedegreeblog.com/wgu-c954-information-technology-management/) is a FANTASTIC read for those interested. Personally I loved this class because I felt like it tied everything together and gave me PRACTICAL insight into how companies (and specifically their IT department) function. If you're interested in additional learning opportunities beyond WGU, definitely look into Hubspot. It's a very popular CRM (well, it's more than just a CRM) that a lot of employers care about.\\n\\nC783 - I actually have weird circumstances regarding this class. I *forgot* to submit my CAPM certification prior to my start date. I reached out to my mentor and Student Support Services for help. My Mentor was able to fill out a form or something... and well, WGU made an exception for me. WGU makes it clear that they don't accept transfer credit after matriculation but they did for me, just this once. As a result, my program changed a little bit. I believe the BSIT is normally 122 credits but mine was changed to 138. Because I had passed the CAPM, the additional credits came from other courses, outside of my BSIT program, that were marked as Passed simply because me having the CAPM qualified me as having passed those courses. I never took the WGU OA for this class.\\n\\nI definitely slowed down in my 2nd/3rd terms and honestly I slacked off a lot. I was able to pull myself together and finish despite a lack of motivation. My third term was scheduled to end on the end of March (this month).\\n\\nC769 - My capstone project took me 2 weeks. Mine was about improving the security posture of a fictitious company. I really enjoyed working on this. If you're reading this and are about to start/currently working on your capstone, congrats on making it this far! I had a fun time using resources from my previous classes to work on this. I took this class more seriously than some of the others because I wanted my work to be a reflection of everything I've learnt at WGU.\\n\\nC777 - The dreaded Web Dev Applications. I took the Sophia course that is supposed to provide a foundation for this course so I didn't start with much knowledge. I procrastinated for weeks lol. PLEASE read the Study Guide. [This](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI) is a link to the study guide but I'm not sure if that link works, so please also refer to the 21day challenge document, sent in an email by your course instructor. I also watched the TraversyMedia HTML+CSS video a couple times and followed along with him. He will have you download SublimeTxt which is good, but I chose to use Visual Studio Code. The C777 study guide is your best friend. You're ready for the OA if you can score 90%+ on the practice OA, and if you feel comfortable creating a website. Another thing: some people may disagree with this, but for the purpose of passing your OA, try to not teach yourself additional information that isn't covered in the class. It can be a lot of information, try not to overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nD247 - I hated this class. This was my absolute worst class, and I just hated every second of it. My course instructor was amazing and I absolutely recommend that you review the powerpoints they've created- it's what helped me pass! The powerpoints will most likely be emailed to you. If not, please ask for them. One small mistake will flag your entire answer wrong for OA questions where you have to write code.\\n\\n**Graduation and my Personal Success Story**  \\nI applied for graduation on March 3rd and officially graduated on the 11th. I was emailed a link to download my WGU transcripts the next day, and was emailed a digital copy of my Diploma today (the 18th). I'm still waiting for my physical diploma and [regalia](https://www.buildagrad.com/wgu) to arrive. I'll be attending the Vegas commencement in April, hope to see you all there!!!! Maybe we can get a big groupchat together for people going! :)\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, I was offered an internship at my friend's dad's IT company. It was very informal and honestly a little disappointing but I was grateful for the opportunity to observe their work and go with them to meet with clients. I stayed with them for about 3 months or so and then decided to take a break to focus on my last two classes. Part of me regretted leaving my security job but I also didn't want to continue working there either. In the end, it worked out for me because I was able to put that \"internship\" on my resume and I figured that it looks better than no internship.\\n\\nI started to apply for jobs the moment I submitted my graduation application, which is what I recommend to everyone (if not sooner). However, it wasn't until after I graduated when I found the job posting for the job I got an offer for. I graduated on 3/11- on 3/12 I applied to this IT support technician job. I reached out to the recruiter (guide on that below) and we instantly connected. She helped me secure a screener interview (through Zoom) with the company later that week. I passed the screener interview and we set up an in-person interview yesterday. Honestly, I bombed the technical questions. I got destroyed in front of the CEO. I think I got the position because I spoke confidently and was transparent about my knowledge gaps. I arrived in a freshly dry-cleaned suit with 3 copies of my resume, and I took notes during the interview on my black leather padfolio (please buy one of these!). Every time they asked me a technical question I didn't know the answer to, I wrote it down, and said I'd research the answer. Also- before my interview- I wrote down questions I had for them, in my padfolio.\\n\\nThe job I was offered is a hybrid position and I couldn't be happier!!!! In 1.5 years I went from a security guard making 17/hr to making TC\\~60k in an MCOL, and I still live w my parents so no rent. Never, absolutely *never* doubt yourself.\\n\\nBelow are some tips I have for Resumes, Cover Letters, Applying, and Interviews. :)\\n\\n**Resume and Cover Letter Tips**  \\nYou already know that your resume (and cover letter) is extremely important, so I'm going to talk about how you can improve. Resume formats and the amount of creativity you can have really depends on the industry, so please don't interpret this as an end-all-be-all guide. This is more so for tech. Bluntly, you should have a pretty straightforward and easy-to-read resume.\\n\\n* Your resume should be 1 page unless you have 10-15+ years of experience. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jeg5ks/4_yoe_unemployed_tech_field_united_states/) is similar to what I use for mine (Idk why it's so zoomed in). Also please don't use a two-column layout.\\n* Your resume should be in an ATS-readable font such as Arial or Times New Roman (I use TNR for mine) and size 11 or 12.\\n* I suggest that you keep your resume in black and white. Don't use icons, shapes, or emojis. Far too often I see resumes with a little phone icon or something next to their phone number. These icons/shapes/emojis can look nice but they can also mess with the ATS (applicant tracking system) scanners, and also take the readers attention away from important details as they can be very eye-catching.\\n* Aim to fill the entire page. If you don't have enough experience or whatever that's completely fine, but there are ways to mitigate that. For instance you should use 12px size font, maybe expand upon your PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY section, make the size of your headings a little bigger, etc. You could also put a Relevant Coursework section in your Resume and name your WGU classes (don't include the course code \"C268\", just the name). This is what I did. During an interview, the hiring manager asked me about one of my classes!\\n* Your name/contact info section should contain your Firstname Lastname, phone number (xxx) xxx-xxxx, email (make sure your email sounds professional. Your professional email shouldn't be \"[gamerboy1206@gmail.com](mailto:gamerboy1206@gmail.com)\", it should be your name), a link to your Linkedin profile, and then city, State. Never put your exact address on your resume. That's a security concern and they don't need your address anyways, or at least until you get a job offer.\\n* Please, Please trim your Linkedin handle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNDY2KnXBw) for a guide on how to do that. Ensure your trimmed Linkedin handle is then put at the top of your resume\\n* If you have experience that isn't relevant to what you're applying for, put it on your resume anyways! Especially if you were there for a long time or if you really gained skills/experience.\\n* The bullet points under your jobs should NOT be pure fluff words. Instead, write meaningful statistics and hard facts.\\n   * \"Increased operational efficiency\" means nothing. Instead, you can put \"Achieved X through Y which resulted in Z\"\\n   * One of the bullet points in my resume is \"Efficiently handled over 100+ monthly calls, including inquiries, service calls, incident reports, technical support, and emergency responses.\" This bullet point includes an actual statistic, \"100+\", in a timeframe \"monthly\", and I specified the different types of regular issues I dealt with. Truthfully, I could have been more specific on \"technical support\", but I got the message across that I handled a variety of different inquiries. My intention there was to showcase my diverse skillset- again, there is always room to improve!\\n* WGU actually offers classes on Resume building, and will review your resume for free. You can find information to that [here](https://careers.wgu.edu/channels/resumes/). I did this, and the results were amazing! The more people you can get to look over your resume, the better.\\n* !! This one is very important. The end result of your resume should be a PDF. I've always used Google Docs online to create my resume. It allows me to convert it into a PDF with two clicks of my mouse. When you download your PDF, PLEASE rename it to \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_Resume\", instead of just \"Resume\". This will make it 1000x easier for hiring managers to see your resume and know it's from you. A lot of people name their resume just \"Resume\"... you need to stand out, and that's how you do it!\\n\\nIn addition to a resume, you should also make a cover letter template. Meaning, for every new cover letter you create, you change the name of the job title and company (written in the CL) to match the job you're applying for.\\n\\n* If you choose to make two templates, here is what I recommend you do: the first template should be called \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_CoverLetter\\_CompanyName\" and also \"FirstName.Lastname.CoverLetter.CompanyName\". That way, there is a slight difference between the two (that only you know of) and it still looks professional. For instance, lets say you want to apply to Helpdesk roles and Project Coordinator roles. The Helpdesk cover letter template could be the one with the periods, whereas the Project Coordinator cover letter templates could be the one with the underscores. Again, this is a very subtle way for you to distinguish between the two, so you can have a more personalized cover letter for the jobs you're applying to. This is actually what I do personally.\\n   * For example, my Project Coordinator cover letter is more geared towards PM/Project coordinator positions. It mentions my CAPM cert\\n* Your Cover letter should contain the same name and contact info as your resume. Same email, phone number, city, etc.\\n* Your CL (ideally) should be the same font and font size as your resume. I don't think this is necessarily required but the attention-to-detail can go a long way. I like the uniformity of doing it this way.\\n* As a general rule of thumb: the first paragraph (3-4 sentences) should explain who you are, the body paragraph should talk about your experiences, qualifications, why you want the position, and why you're a good fit, and the closing paragraph (2-3 sentences) should reaffirm your interest, express gratitude, and indicate your eagerness to discuss this opportunity/interview.\\n\\n**My 'Guide-to-Apply'**  \\nIt's vey rare that I'll hear back from an application submitted thru Indeed. LinkedIn is my preferred way to apply. I have LinkedIn premium (I highly suggest you try the $0 down *free trial*). I swear, it's what helped me get this job. If you get contacted about scheduling an interview, your next steps should be to research the company ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is an amazingggg tool for this).\\n\\n* Look up for tech job openings near you. Most of IT (and some CS) start out in job titles such as Helpdesk, Support I, jr IT specialist, IT technician, stuff of that nature. That's what you should be looking for. Don't expect to go right into cybersecurity lol. The reality is that cybersecurity is mid-level and senior-level.\\n* Have realistic salary expectations. A huge factor is where you live (understand the terms LCOL, MCOL, HCOL). But I think that a very general rule of thumb is that out of college you can reasonably expect between 40-65k for an entry level IT job, with the national avg being about 51k ish.\\n* GET A PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT TAKEN FOR YOUR LINKEDIN. Have your hair nice, shave your face or freshen up your facial hair, wear a fresh outfit, have a SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND, and just be presentable. You should want to look your best. [This is interesting:](https://www.earth.com/news/attractive-people-have-more-career-opportunities-and-success/)\\n   * DON'T put your headshot (or any pictures) on your resume. This might be a norm in other cultures but definitely not for tech jobs in the US\\n* Go on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and get a nice background for your linkedin. Doesn't have to have any text, could even just be a solid color with a gentle gradiant. Anything is (usually) better than the default background. Mine is just a blue background with some lines on it, it looks like waves. It's just an artistic thing. But I made sure that the tie I'm wearing in my profile picture is the same shade of blue as my background. I think it ties it together nicely.\\n* Reach out to a recruiter. I wouldn't have gotten this job opportunity without my recruiter's help. In my opinion, a good recruiter might feel like a 'temporary career coach'. My recruiter gave me advice, gave me constant updates, insight, etc. She was amazing. This is the message I sent her to initiate our first conversation:\\n   * Hi,  I hope you're doing well! I came across the *JobName* position at *CompanyName* and am very interested. I’d love to learn more about the key qualities and skills you’re looking for in applicants. Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to send my resume if that would be helpful.  Looking forward to your reply!  Best, *FullName*\\n* Monitor your email regularly. People don't like to be kept waiting, especially when companies may be interviewing potentially hundreds of other applicants.\\n\\n**Interviews**  \\nOne of the best resources for interviews (and resumes too) I've ever come across is chief.analyst on tiktok.  Even though he's in an entirely different industry (finance), I love his advice and how articulate he is. Being able to speak confidently and clearly is a non-negotiable. Never underestimate the importance of good communication- it's what helped me get this job after not being able to answer a single technical question correctly despite being up against over 160 other applicants.\\n\\nIt's typical for you to go through a virtual interview before being invited to an in-person interview. This is called a screener and as the name suggests, it's for screening out candidates who don't meet the qualifications necessary or those who appear to be unenthusiastic. Showing enthusiasm and positive energy is incredibly important- you can show this by asking questions, smiling, and knowing what the company does.\\n\\n* I mentioned this earlier in my Graduation section but invest in a padfolio. I think I got mine for $12 from Target. It should carry 3 copies of your resume (anything more is excessive) business cards if you have them (I personally did not), a pen (ensure that it works and isn't out of ink!), and paper for notes. You don't need your padfolio for a virtual interview- instead, I'd recommend you have your full attention on the interviewer. It helps to look directly at the camera (instead of your screen) so it gives the illusion you're looking directly at the interviewer, from their end.\\n* In my padfolio, I also wrote down questions I wanted to ask the interviewers, the night prior to the interview. Having pre-written questions made me look more prepared and took the burden off of me of having to remember them.\\n* Push in your chair after getting up, like when leaving your interview. Similarly- if they offer you water at the start of your interview, make sure you throw out the cup in a trashcan and don't leave litter in their office.\\n* Maintain eye contact and speak slowly. For me, it helps when I use my hands when I talk.\\n* Look, dress, and smell nice. You don't have to be a model but definitely make yourself look the best you possibly can. Also, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.\\n* I like watching CareerVidz on Youtube because he comes across as a little silly and that may (hopefully) take some pressure off of you. It's okay to be nervous, but try not to make it apparent.\\n* Rehearse your [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54).\\n* Research the company you're applying for, before any interviews. You can show a genuine interest in the company by understanding what they do and who they are.\\n* References: If you don't have any professional references, you can definitely ask a course instructor or your Program Mentor! They are here to support you and they will absolutely vouch for you (speaking from experience).\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI think it's incredibly important to continuously grow and improve regardless of which stage you're at- whether you're considering enrolling, have already enrolled, are about to graduate, or even if you're looking for a job. I'm hopeful that my write-up is able to offer a fresh perspective on the challenges and possibilities you might encounter. Sorry for any typos/weirdly worded sentences lol.\\n\\nI'm now looking forward to starting my MSITM on April 1 and starting my new job. If you have any tips/advice for the MSITM program, I'd love to get some info\\n\\nHope to see y'all at the Vegas commencement ceremony!!\\n\\nEDITS: Expanded upon my internship, additional random bullet points all throughout</td>\n",

       "      <td>D288 - Back-End Programming 2024 Guide!\\nHello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click &gt; new &gt; Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n&gt;Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: &lt;version&gt;3.3.6&lt;/version&gt;\\nLombok: &lt;version&gt;1.18.36&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\\n&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\n&lt;version&gt;3.3.6&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\n\\n```\\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;\\n&lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\n&lt;version&gt;1.18.36&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n&gt;MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n&gt;When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below.

       "      <td>BSSWE Java Track Monster Guide and Review\\nI finally graduated! After 3 terms, working full time at my job and as a father. I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database &amp; SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&amp;list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching &amp; promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope &amp; out-of-scope), requirements (functional &amp; non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development &amp; testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.</td>\n",

       "      <td>D287 Java Frameworks Ultimate Project Guide\\nWGU students, by now you have likely experienced or heard how this course is low effort, half finished garbage. Well, since they can't be bothered to fix this course, it is up to us to help each other out. This post is my attempt to help fellow students with this project. After stumbling through this project for like a month and a half, I finally finished it and here is my best attempt at a guide.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly, get your IntelliJ Ultimate downloaded, and get your project files on your local machine. Check out my previous post at to get through task step A: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, so this project basically gives you a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and a myspace looking old school HTML user interface, and your job is to customize the code to meet a customers needs. You need to come up with a shop that will have 5 sample products, and 5 generic parts that can be combined to make those products. They give the example of a bicycle shop that has different bike types for products, like mountain bike/ road bike etc. and then generic parts for those such as seat, handlebars, gears etc. Do not overthink this, just choose something and keep it simple and generic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo know what the heck is going on, here is some background info. To get something like this to work, it is convenient to use a framework, something to contain all your different files and get them to work together the way we want, while offering tools and libraries to simplify development and let us focus on the logic and features of the application we are creating. Often used with Spring is Spring boot, a sub project of Spring that simplifies things for us even more by using embedded web servers so you don't have to install and configure a separate web server, while also offering auto-configuration, so we have less to do manually to make sure that any files/classes etc that depend on other files/classes/methods etc have the information shared to be able to carry out their functions. This project uses a common design pattern known as MVC (model view controller). This is a way to organize an applications files based on its function which promotes organization, modularization, maintainability, reusability, testability, and improves development efficiency. Now if you have opened your project, it may seem overwhelming the amount of files in there, so I am going to try to tell you what files belong to what part of MVC, and a bit about what they do so you know what you are looking at.  \\n\\n\\n**Model:** represents the applications data and business logic. Encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the app, including data manipulation, validation, and interactions with the database. The files for this project relating to the model are:\\n\\n* Entities: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;domain you have 4 .java files containing entities. These are your classes, for the different types of parts, and for products. Entities are marked with the annotation '@Entity' which tells Spring this is an entity, allowing it to work its magic to make these work the way we want overall for the application.\\n* Repositories: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;repositories you have 4 repository .java files corresponding to the entity files. Repository files allow for CRUD (create read update delete) on the database. These files interact with the database and are marked with '@Repository'. Note that these files extend CrudRepository which eliminates the need for the annotation.\\n* Service: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;service, there are service files and service implementation files. The service files contain declarations but not the definitions, while the implementation files have the definitions to implement the service. Services interact with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.\\n* Validators: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;validators, contains .java files that contains the actual validation logic, and annotation files that allow you to make a custom annotation to easily mark your other files with ('@CustomAnnotation') to get the validation enforced. Code that enforces validation rules and constraints for your data.\\n\\n**View:** responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It encompasses the user interface elements, templates, and visual elements that users interact with. Views receive data from the Model and render it in a way that's suitable for presentation. Views also capture user input and pass it to the Controller for further processing. The files for the view layer are:\\n\\n* HTML Templates: src-&gt;main&gt;resources-&gt;templates. These are all your html files that contain the format and structure for the webpages you see. This project uses Thymeleaf, a template engine that helps make dynamic html content.\\n* CSS: found in src-&gt;main-&gt;resources-&gt;static-&gt;css. This provides additional styling for the webpages to enhance the look and feel.\\n\\n**Controller:** These classes handle user requests, process input, interact with the Model, and determine which View should be rendered. Controllers are annotated with '@Controller'. In general, a controller in a Spring application is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate HTTP response. Controllers typically have methods annotated with '@RequestMapping'(or other annotations like '@GetMapping','@PostMapping', etc.) to define the URL paths they handle and the HTTP methods they respond to. The controllers are found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;controllers.\\n\\n**Other Notable Files:** There are some files that aren't included in MVC but are still important to recognize. These are:\\n\\n* BootStrapData.java: The purpose of this class is to provide initial data for testing and development, ensuring that there is data to work with when starting the application. This file is located at src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;bootstrap\\n* application.properties: a configuration file in a Spring Boot application that allows you to configure various settings and properties for your application. It is used to customize the behavior of your application without requiring changes to the source code. \\n* test files: located at src-&gt;test, contains files for testing your code.\\n* .gitignore: this file is used to specify files and directories that you want ignored by git when tracking changes in your project. I did not use this file at all for this project. Is found in target directory.\\n* mvn &amp; mvnw: These are files used to ensure the right version of Maven is being used to build the project regardless of whether you have it installed or not. Maven is a build automation and project management tool that simplifies the process of managing and building software projects by providing a structured way to handle dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging.\\n* pom.xml: is the Project Object Model configuration file used by Maven to define project details, dependencies, and build settings for a Java project.\\n* README.md: is used to provide a brief and informative description of a project, often found at the root of a repository, to help users understand its purpose and usage. We will be using this file to track the changes we make for task steps C thru J.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, hopefully that helps, I was completely lost and overwhelmed at first but hopefully that gives you some background and helps you see how the pieces fit together. If it doesn't make sense yet, it will start to as you work through the project and see how things work together and interact. Anyway, on to the tasks!\\n\\n**NOTE:** to view and test your web app, open your browser and go to localhost:8080. This will show you your webpage in its current state. You must run the application successfully in IntelliJ for this to work. You will be using this a lot to make sure your changes are working the way you want and you are meeting the requirements.  \\n\\n\\n**Task B:** This part is super easy, they want you to create a README file, but there already is one! What I did here was I kept the nice WGU and D287 header stuff deleted the rest, and then I copy and pasted the task requirements from parts C to J so I could type my changes for each part under the step it is a part of.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**NOTE:**  For tasks C - J you have to commit and push with a message to the remote repository after the completion of each step. You are allowed to push more often, but at a minimum you must push after each step is completed and put a brief meaningful message. At the end you will have to get the history and submit it with your zip file. I made a new branch to do all my changes to, and named it working\\_brach, as this is more common than doing work on the main branch. To make a new branch, go to the bottom right of the screen, click the current branch, and it will bring up some options. Click new branch, name it something like working\\_branch, and check the box for checkout branch so that you make it the branch you are working on.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task C:** For this step, you will be working in mainscreen.html. You will need to customize this page to reflect your custom shop choice, changing the titles and headers appropriately. Make sure to log the changes and locations on the README. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message. You can do this by clicking the git tab and then clicking commit, and it should bring up a commit window where your project window usually is, and then you can select what changes to commit, type your message, and select commit &amp; push. Almost every time I did this, I got warnings and it stopped the push, and I had to click push anyway. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task D:** For this part you need to understand some basic html. This step you need to make an about page, and so you will need firstly a template, so create a new html template with all your other templates (when asked if you want to add your new file to git, always say yes). This file will be where you create all the visuals for your about page, where you describe briefly your business and who its for. I just put some super generic stuff about how we care about the customer and giving back etc. I copy and pasted the first 12 or so lines from another html template just so it had the same styling and structure info as the other webpages. I personally tried to match the look of mainscreen.html, but you can make it however you want. Remember to catalogue each change you make in the README.md file. For example, if you add a title for your about page, you would put something like: -about.html: added title 'About' on line 15. You need to say what file, have it under the correct task letter, and say what line(s) the change(s) is(are) on and what the change(s) is(are). When you are satisfied with your about.html, you will need to make a controller for it in the directory with all the other controllers. The controller is being used to map the URL to  the corresponding webpage and guiding Spring on which template to utilize for rendering the content. Remember to annotate your controller with '@Controller' just like in the other controller classes, and you will also need the @GetMapping(\"name\\_of\\_about\\_template\\_here\") in your class definition to connect the template and the url such that you can reach this page and see it by going to localhost:8080/about\\_template\\_name\\_here. Check out the other controller classes to get an idea how for this, or watch a video on it if needed. On mainscreen.html, you will need to add a button that takes you to the about page you created, I just copy and pasted similar code for other buttons and changed the link for it and name to make this work. Similarly, on your about html file you will want to add a link or a button back to the mainscreen. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n **Task E:** Now you need to add a sample inventory consisting of 5 products and 5 parts. There is commented out code in the BootStrapData.java file that gives you an example of how to create a part and a product (in separate spots), you can use that and change it to make 5 of each. You either need to add an if statement that checks if the parts count and products count is zero before adding the sample inventory, or you will need to comment your code out after the sample is added to your page so you don't keep adding duplicates. If you don't add the logic to check for this, make sure to make a note somewhere to uncomment this code back out before you submit your project, or it will get sent back as they will not see your sample database get loaded in. (Hint: I used variables for part count and product count and set them equal to their respective repository classes and used the .count() method to see if both were == 0 before adding the sample inventory). Once you are done, commit and push with a message. Make sure you are logging all your changes!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task F:** This step asks you to add a Buy Now button next to the update and delete buttons for your products. The button needs to decrease the inventory of the purchased product by one, and make no changes to the inventory of parts. You need to display a message for failure or success of a purchase. First I would add the button to mainscreen.html in the appropriate spot. There is a table in mainscreen.html that sets up the products table, you will see it referencing tempProduct.name, .price, .inv, and then you will see the update and delete buttons. You will want to add your Buy Now button in here. The button here is a bit tricky as you need it to map to /buyProduct URL (we will make the controller for this later) and you need to set it up for http POST request so it can access and update the inventory amount for purchased products. You also need to pass a hidden input field so that you can pass the tempProduct.id along to the controller. I would post the code for this but I don't want this post to get taken down lol. Next you need to make a new controller to handle the desired behavior of the buy now button. Once you make your controller, make sure to annotate it as a controller. For this controller I added a private ProductRepository object with an '@Autowired' annotation, as the ProductRepository provides methods for interacting with the database which we need to do to decrement the inventory by 1 after purchase, and the annotation injects an instance of ProductRepository into this controller, which allows it to use the methods it needs. Just like the other controllers, we are going to make a public String method, I called it buyProduct. For its input parameters, you need to use the '@RequestParam' annotation to be able to obtain the productID from the product that was purchased over on mainscreen. Next I created an Optional &lt;Product&gt; object that assigns its value to the .findById method of the product repository, using the productID obtained from '@RequestParam'. By using Optional&lt;Product&gt;, the code handles the possibility that the requested product might not exist in the database. It avoids directly returning null when the product is not found, which helps improve code readability and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. This object basically represents whether the product was found in the database or not. Using that, you can set up if statements based on whether that object.isPresent() is true or not, and if it is true, you can create a Product object and set it equal to the optional object.get(). You can then set up an additional if statement that checks if that products inventory (product.getInv) is above 0, if it is then you can set the inventory for it to its current value -1 (decrement the inventory like the instructions wanted). Make sure to save this new value using the product repository .save() method to save the new count to the repository. If this part of the code is reached, then the product had enough in stock to be purchased, its inventory was subtracted by one to reflect a purchase, and now you can generate a success message. There are many ways to do this (as is the case with most of the project), but I personally made a new html template both for a purchase success and a purchase error. You can use a redirect statement in your return statement to the url of your success page for the case that the purchase went through, or to your error page if it did not. You will need to add '@GetMapping' annotations and displayPurchaseSuccess (or error) methods that return to the appropriate url. After the controller is all setup, you make your html templates for the success and error pages if thats the way you chose to do. These can be super simple, basically mine just said purchase successful or purchase error in big letters when the page loaded. When everything is working and looking the way you want, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task G:** In this step you have to add max and min inventory fields for parts, modify your sample inventory to show the max and min inventory, and update both the part forms to have additional inputs for the max and min inventory. Then they want you to rename the database file, and add code that enforces that the inventory is between the max and min values. First go to Part.java, and add the minInv and maxInv fields (name em whatever you want), you can also use the same '@Min' annotation as the other fields to enforce that it cannot be below zero, and have a message with it. Be sure to also add a new constructor that includes these new fields, and make getter and setter functions for them. Next go back to BootStrapData.java and add max and min inventory values for your sample inventory parts. Then for both InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm, add text inputs for both max and min inventory. You can probably figure out how to put it in there just by seeing how the other fields are put in there and copying it but changing as necessary. Then rename the database file, it will look something like this **spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db** you can find it in file explorer or finder and right click it and rename it to whatever you like. In the application.properties file, you will need to rename it there as well and make sure they match. Next I would create a method in Part.java that checks if an inventory is valid, by returning true if the inventory falls between the max and min values, and returns false otherwise. For both inhouse and outsourced part controller files, add logic that uses the isInvValid method you created to generate an error message if the inventory is outside of range. I used BindingResult to reject bad values with a message, look into this for the error messaging. Once this is working as expected and desired, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task H:** This step wants you to add additional error messages and more specific error messages, one for if the inventory is below the minimum, one for if the inventory is above the maximum, and one for if adding/updating a product would cause an associated part to fall below the minimum. This isn't too bad, adding some more if else type logic to both inhouse and outsourced part controllers will take care of the first two conditions I listed. For the last requirement, I edited EnufPartsValidator.java with some additional requirements in the if statement that returns false to check if any of the parts for the product would fall below their minimum if the product was made (Hint: p.getInv() - 1 &lt; p.getMinInv()). I also updated the error message from ValidEnufParts to be more specific. When you are happy with the results and everything has been tested and working, commit with a message and push. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task I:** Add two unit tests to the PartTest class for the maximum and minimum inventory fields. The course resources has a video for this. You go to the file, and use the '@Test' annotation, and then make two tests that look similar to the tests already in this file. For min, you can set the minimumInv to a number that you expect to be the lowest to be used for the program, its just an arbitrary test number. Then you use partIn and set its value to the variable you just assigned, and use assertEquals() to make sure that it works as expected. Repeat for partOut. Do all this again but for maximumInv. Thats it for this one. When it is working, commit and push with message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task J:** Remove the class files for any unused validators. This one was so simple it had me doubting myself. When you open the validators, it will tell you how many usages intellij recognized for them. One of them had no usages so I deleted that one. It was really that simple lol. Commit and push with a message. This is the last step that needs to be tracked in the read me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow double check you meet all the rubric requirements, watch the completed project video from the course resources and make sure you got all the right stuff, and when you are satisfied and everything is working, export your project to a ZIP. Next on Gitlab, go to the code tab on the left hand side, expand it with a click and then select repository graph. This shows your commit and push history and must be turned in. Use print button and then specify print to PDF, and save it to your computer. You must turn this in with your project ZIP. Finally, get the url for your gitlab by clicking the blue clone button and copying the https url. When you submit, you need the ZIP, the repository graph, and the URL. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI hope this guide helps, please let me know of any mistakes or typos, I wanted to do this quickly and move on to my next course. If you have questions feel free to ask, but just know I stumbled my way through this and by no means to I understand everything or am an expert. This guide does not constitute the right way, best way, only way, or most efficient way to do this project. It is just what worked for me. I tried to tell you as much as possible without just giving things away and getting in trouble lol.  When you guys finish this course, make sure to let them know honestly how you feel about the course in the end of course survey! Best of luck. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

       "      <td>WGU MBA - The \"Sort of\" Accelerated Adventure\\nJuly seems to be a good month for me. July 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from WGU in Business Management. After that was done, I wrote this post, to give my take on the \"Sort of\" acceleration I did through my undergrad studies. It's a long read...but...if you want context for this post...feel free to give it a skim: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu\\_bs\\_in\\_business\\_management\\_the\\_sortof/geijacp/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu_bs_in_business_management_the_sortof/geijacp/?context=3)\\n\\nFast forward to July 2021...and I just completed my MBA at WGU as well. Like I said...July seems to be my jam. My first Graduate Term at WGU started in October 2020, so I accelerated two years of course work, into a little less than 10 months. Not too shabby. \\n\\nNow, you've likely seen other posts. \"I accelerated my Bachelors degree (or MBA) in 2 weeks\" or something of the like. My point here, is the same as it was last time: I'm not racing anyone. I applaud those who were able to do in minutes what took me months. However, for those who are still with me here...keep in mind I work full time in the Tech sector as a Senior Program Manager, I coach high school athletics on the side, and I have a family that I happen to enjoy spending time with. That's why I title my posts as a \"sort of\" acceleration. I don't have every hour of my day to devote to classwork so I can hammer out 11 classes in 11 days; but I want to give back to the WGU subreddit, because I got a lot of assists from these posts and I want to help others, who may only be looking for a kick in the arse that they can do it too. I did what I could in the evenings to devote to my school work, and on weekends too. But, I really didn't sacrifice an entire weekend to school at any point. I enjoy sipping my coffee. I also just happened to have an Appendicitis during my MBA Adventure, so that didn't exactly help my cause! \\n\\nI gave a lot of advice and pro-tips in my Bachelor's Degree post above. But, I'll reiterate the important ones here, up front:   \\n\\n\\n**1)** Get a Business Calculator, (I bought the BA II Plus) and learn it. *Know thy calculator*. It will save you a LOT of time. \"But, hey OP. I have a graphing calculator. I'm good.\" Sure, but, you could be better off. The Business Calculator, when you get into the Financing Courses will legit save you a ton of time. \\n\\n**2)** Be nice to your exam proctors. They work in a call center for God knows how many hours a day, watching people take exams. Sometimes they'll ask you to do something that no other proctor asks you to do. Just, go with it. Sometimes I was asked to take off my Smart Watch, sometimes, I wasn't. Sometimes I was asked to take my hand away from my face during exams (I tend to rest my chin on my hands during exams); other times, I wasn't asked to do that. Sometimes I quietly talk through an exam question to myself, and sometimes the proctor would chime in and ask me if I was talking to someone in the room, and I'd have to rotate the camera to show I was alone; and sometimes it didn't matter at all. But, there's no need to make your proctored exams more stressful then they may already be. Just go with the flow. They're human, just like you and I are, and there isn't a single proctor out there like \"I'm totally going to try and get this person to fail their exam\". Be kind. \\n\\n**3)** Be patient when you submit papers for grading. They have three days to return it to you. *Pro-Tip*: if you can avoid it, try to get your papers submitted before the end of the month. There is legitimately a term ending at the end of every month; so the volume increases a lot at the end of the month. I generally found papers I'd turn in, in the middle of the month would get graded in 12-36 hours; whereas at the end of the month, you can bank on it taking all three days. For whatever it's worth to you. \\n\\n**4)** Regarding papers: I said it before, I will repeat myself: Follow. The. Rubric. Every. Single. Word. Of. It. If you deviate from the Rubric, it doesn't matter how much you write, or how eloquent you are, or what your experience is in professional writing in your career. You will get your paper returned. You could write War and Peace, and get your paper returned. Or, you could follow the Rubric, write two pages, and pass. Just give them what they ask for, because that's what they're looking for to grade.\\n\\n**5)** It's okay to fall behind a bit, or to stall out a bit. My term started in October 2020. I didn't even get to open the first course until November, because of a work deadline. You can catch up. In the MBA program, you have six months to complete three classes. Anything else, is gravy. \\n\\n**6)** Take the Pre-Assessment straight-away when starting a class with a proctored exam. Have no fear. There is no penalty for getting crushed on the Pre-Assessment, and there's no limit to the number of times you can take it. But, you want the Assessment Report at the end of it. It will not only tell you the weight of each section to better help you study, but will also give you an answer key to see what you missed. As a bonus, if you pass it, it unlocks your Proctored Exam (Objective Assessment/OA) right away, so you can schedule it. I took the Pre-Assessment straight-away for every class I had with an exam, and it helped me shore up where I was weak, and I saved time by not studying sections I aced. \\n\\n**7)** Get a Quizlet account. You're welcome.\\n\\nHere we go:   \\n\\n\\nThere are eleven courses to complete for your MBA. Six of them have a Proctored Exam, five are written papers. The Data Driven Decision Making course (C207) has both Proctored Exam, and two papers to write. I'm going through them, in the order I took them, over the course of ten months (one, six-month term, and then three and a half months of a second term). I took some cues from a post by [https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) and his Mega Thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/). I always like to give credit where it's due. They had a bit of a different journey than I did, but we also had some similarities. But, I did draw some inspiration from their post, which is why it looks similar! \\n\\n**Managing Organizations and Leading People (C200)** *– Two Papers*   \\nThey ease you in with a pretty easy class up front. First up, get the Signature Themes Assessment out of the way. I think it took me about a half hour ish. Download the result, and start in on your papers. I wrote both papers over the course of two days. Paper 1 wants you to talk about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Paper 2 is for you to use a situation with a real organization, but you have to redact the info, and make up fake names. Then you write about a leader you know in the org. No reinvention of the wheel here. \\n\\n**Managing Human Capital (C202)** *– One Proctored Exam (OA)*   \\nThis class was super chill. Honestly, anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content here as common workplace knowledge. Not necessarily every word, but you know what I mean. I took the pre-assessment straight-away without looking at a single word of the course, passed it, and then scheduled my OA for that weekend to give me a couple days to study where I was weak. Took my OA a couple days later, and passed. \\n\\n**Management Communication (C204)** *– One Paper, One PowerPoint &amp; Video + One Executive Summary*   \\nPaper 1 involves writing up a few emails and letters to your staff, your industry contact and your shareholders of your company that distributes a hot and fancy new product, depending on your chosen scenario. you pick. This is a class to have fun with. Level of Difficulty is not high at all. After Paper 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow. The. Rubric. Then you make a Panopto video. It's very easy. You download and install the Panopto (or use the web version). When it opens, add your PowerPoint you created, and start recording your presentation. My video was about 8 1/2 minutes, and I passed on the first attempt. Then write your Executive Summary of your PPTX and submit the lot. This all took me about a work week in the evenings, but if you had a weekend you could probably hammer it out in a full day, maybe two.\\n\\n**Marketing (C212)** *– One Paper*   \\nI've seen other posts calling this paper a monster. I respectfully disagree. Mine was ten pages, including the title page, table of contents and references. So, my actual content was seven pages long. Just follow the Rubric. I've seen other posts where they wrote 16+ pages. They must reeeeeeeeeally love writing more than I do. I don't add a lot of fluff. Just write what they ask for. You are tasked with writing a proposal for a hot new product from any of seven provided industries. (I work in the Technology sector, so I chose Technology.) This took me about a week, but I started this class the day after Thanksgiving. So, between Turkey Coma and Black Friday (which, let's be honest...due to COVID-19, there wasn't really a Black Friday, as much as there was me not wanting to look at school while I made leftover stuffing...and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...)\\n\\nI'm grouping the next two together. C213 and C214. Here comes that need for the Business Calculator. Friendly Reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Let it do the work for you. My best advice is this: Do whatever you must with your Program Mentor to get them to schedule these two back-to-back. Bribe them, beg them, or simply ask them. Taking C214 immediately after C213 is a game changer, as they tie into one another like Cookies and Cream. I asked my mentor about it; he sort of waffled; so I asked again, and he adjusted my Degree Plan so I could take them back-to-back. \\n\\n**Accounting for Decision Makers (C213)** *– One OA*  \\nThere are some calculations and math, but not too terribly much. I've seen other posts that say \"don't worry about the math, just focus on all the other class material and you'll be good\". False. Disagree. Nope. Spend time on the math. There's enough math on the exam that if you bomb the math, you're going to essentially need to be perfect on the rest of the exam to pass. I have a strategy on any sort of Finance, Statistics, or Math exams that include theory questions as well. I do the non-math related questions first. If I get to a question that includes an equation, I skip it, and come back to it. Save all the math to last, that way once I switch my brain to calculations, I don't have to switch it back. For me, that's helps bring down the stress level. (Having a beer with me during the exam also helps. Just saying.) I used the same strategy for Financial Management. This one took me four days, because I had a weekend in there that I could devote 2-3 hours at a time to, here and there. Otherwise, probably would have taken a week or so, with after work studying.\\n\\n**Financial Management (C214)** – *One OA*   \\nAnother reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Especially if you've never used a financial calculator before. All the formulas you need will be given to you on the Pre-Assessment and the OA, you don’t have to remember any of them. You'll find many things from C213 carry over here, so that's nice...and the reason I say do whatever you can to take this immediately after C213. Memorize the Financial Concepts as best you can. The math won’t be crazy tough, especially if you *Know thy calculator*. There are more non-math questions than there are finance math questions, but don't skimp on learning the math. Last thing you want is to start second guessing your non-math question answers, because you're not feeling too confident about the Finance Math questions. This one took me two weeks, an hour here and an hour there. \\n\\n**Ethical Leadership (C206)** – *Three Papers*   \\nI admit it. Writing papers bores me to death. With an exam, I can get in, hammer it out, and be done. Not so much with papers. But, c'est la vie. Another easy one, just a time suck because of having to write not one, not two, but ***three*** papers. Blah. First up, do the “Ethical Lens Inventory” task in the course itself. Pretty sure this took me a half hour or so. For Paper 1, write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. I used someone I used to work for. But, I've seen other posts that they wrote about Lincoln, etc. Write about different leadership concepts. For Paper 2, write about social responsibility and leadership. For Paper 3, write about the code of ethics and its various leadership applications. All three papers, including citations, was a total of 21 pages of writing. Took me two weeks, but in fairness, I was doing this right before Christmas, and decorating the tree, watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and wrapping presents took priority. I'm not sorry. :-)\\n\\n**Data-Driven Decision Making (C207)** – *Two Papers and One OA*   \\nI've read other posts basically calling this class The Devil. Like, bust out the Exorcism for this class, and burn it at the stake for heresy. Honestly, I didn't think it was all that horrible. But, I enjoy data, so to each their own. It took me three weeks. First, form a hypothesis, then you complete Paper 1, which is a form they provide, and turn it in. Then, the data fun starts. Follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis option from the list. I will say this, don't overly complicate things, regardless of how much you like data. Use the T-Test. It's the simplest one, requiring the least amount of data, and therefore has the least friction. You could choose others, but that's like deciding to run a full marathon when you registered for a half-marathon. Not like you're going to get two medals for finishing. Anyways, plot the numbers in Excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for 30 data points. (*Pro-Tip*: Make sure you have the add-on installed in Excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions if you don't). You have to write Paper 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. I was able to get data from my wife's place of work, so this probably made things easier for me too. After Paper 2 passes, then it's time for the OA. Remember when I said \"Get a Quizlet account\" up above? You should use it here. If you're not a data person, take your time. Data isn't an easy topic for many people, so put on your Patience Hat, and grab a beer while you study. \\n\\n**Operations Management (C215)** – *One OA*   \\nSo, I've spent some of my career in Ops Management, so I breezed through this one. I wish I had some pearls of wisdom to share here. I was done in four days, and that's only because the closest OA I could schedule when I wasn't at work...or at near midnight was four days after I took the Pre-Assessment. Topics included supply/demand, operations and employee functions, and process improvement. But again, I've worked in this field, and when I passed the Pre-Assessment with Exemplary across the board, I didn't even bother to crack the study material. So, you may want to search for another sub-Reddit thread that goes into detail here.  \\n\\n**Global Economics for Managers (C211)** – *One OA*   \\nIf you pay even a small bit of attention to business environments, the economy, currency exchange, global corporation behavior, this won’t be a headache. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge on my part. I took the pre-assessment right away as per usual, then scheduled the OA for later that week. Took about 6 days from start to finish. But, this was my last OA, and a cause for celebration! \\n\\n**MBA Capstone (C216)** – *One Business Simulation + Three Papers*   \\nPaper 1 is a PowerPoint presentation + Panopto video (Exactly like C204 above). Task 2 is a pretty lengthy paper as a Stockholder Report (mine was 19 pages); Paper 3 is basically submitting your resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and a tiny paper on what you learned during the MBA that helped you on the Capstone Simulation (mine was 5 total pages, including the cover page and Table of Contents). \\n\\nOf all the courses I have taken with WGU, including my Undergraduate course load, this was by far my most favorite. An actual workplace simulation of opening your own small business. There is a lot of work to do for this course, as there should be for a culminating final of a graduate level degree program. All up, I spent close to three weeks on this sucker. I could have done it faster, but I wanted my presentations to be air tight. Also...above I mentioned an Appendicitis. Well, this is when it hit, was during my Capstone. So, take that into consideration as well. Start off with the simulation. The simulation consists of a start-up business and it's first six quarters of operation that you have to get through. After you get to the end of Q4, you have to stop and that is the information you use for Paper 1 (the PPTX presentation/video) to justify your decisions you've made up to that point.  You actually cannot progress to Q5 and Q6 in the simulation until you pass Paper 1. Don't forget: Follow. The. Rubric. To. The. Letter. This is basically a sales pitch to potential investors in your business. Also, this is where you have to be in professional dress for the camera, so ditch the hoodie and put on a collared shirt. *Pro-Tip 1*: Submit Paper 1, then submit Q4 in the Simulation, in that order. Don't submit your Q4 decisions before turning in the Paper. *Pro-Tip 2*: Do the \"Final Check\" each quarter before you submit your results. Don't deviate from that. You can really screw yourself if you muck something up and submit it. The Final Check looks for errors. Once you pass Paper 1, you'll be able to move on to Q5 and Q6. \\n\\nNext, you'll complete the final two quarters, then comes Paper 2, the Stockholder Report. To beat the long dead horse, Follow. The. Rubric. This isn't going to be a short paper, so buckle up, and knuckle down. This paper is written as a narrative, so don't use the Bullet Points from the Task 2 explanations. You don't want it written as a Book Report; you want to tell the graders a story about why you did what you did, and when you did it, and why you did it.  You'll download reports from the simulation, and take screenshots, and have appendices. But, you can do it, because you're storytelling. Since you made the decisions along the way, you know why you did what you did. You just have to explain it, like you're telling a story about it. I found it to be very fun, and I learned quite a bit by doing it. Again, easily my most favorite class I took at WGU. Once this one is submitted, you're basically in the clear. All the grinding work is done, and Paper 3 awaits...and...they sure do lob you a softball on this one to swing at.\\n\\nPaper 3 is writing a quick explanation of of three competencies you used throughout the MBA program that helped you successfully complete the simulation. You'll then create a SMART goal about your career. Then you discuss and attach three artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification or other that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future. (I used my undergrad degree, and two professional certifications I have - my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and my PMP Certification as my three.) Then update your resume (make sure WGU is listed as the latest school with the expected degree end month and year). Then, print off your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or create a profile if you don't have one). But...don't trip at the finish line! **Follow. The. Rubric.** You don't want the final thing you have to do to be having to re-do a cupcake Paper because you hit Auto-Pilot. Submit the lot. Once you punch submit that last time, sit back and remember Advice Point 3 from above, about being patient while they grade papers. Head to the pub, and drink a well earned beer. Maybe add some Chili-Cheese Fries, for posterity. Just sit and wait to see the good news email hit your Inbox with that glorious subject line \"**You Passed!**\" You did it!!! You made a choice to get your MBA...and now...it's yours! Your program mentor will call or email you very soon. They'll gush about how awesome you did. You'll get an email from Records, that your Mentor submitted you for graduation. Fill that application out when the email comes through. It'll take a couple days to process your degree; and within a couple weeks, you'll get a digital degree you can use online, and shortly thereafter, a package from your Mail Carrier with a super rad piece of paper within, declaring that WGU certifies you to be a master of all things business administration related!\\n\\nCongratulations to you, you're now the proud owner of a Graduate Degree. Now, when you see career opportunities that say \"MBA Required\"; you get to smile; and that's a pretty rad feeling. \\n\\nAnd to you...yes you...reading this wondering if you should enroll. You have obligations. You don't know if you can carve out the time. You work yourself to the bone, and barely have time to sleep. You can do it. I legit work 50+ hour weeks, then I go coach high school sports, then I like to have free time and spend it with my family. Oh...one other thing...I also run marathons competitively. Do you know how long a 23 mile training run takes on a Sunday morning? You don't want to know. But, I made a decision. I knew I could sacrifice some time to open doors that were closed to me previously. Because, it doesn't take forever to get that MBA. It only takes a little time, right now. The longer you delay, the longer it will be before you finish. \\n\\nYou can do it. You can. You just have to make the choice. I don't know you. I will never meet you. I don't know your story, or how you got to where you are right now that lead you to this post. But...I believe in you. But, me believing in you isn't good enough. YOU have to believe in you too. So, stop reading this, and get cracking on that MBA. It's already printed off. It just needs to know your name so it can find it's way to your mailbox and live out it's days, decorating your wall in a diploma frame. :-)\\n\\nGood luck!</td>\n",

This is only to let people know how “I” did it.  Please don’t take this as a “be all end all”. I take no responsibility  for your progress, and everyone has to put in their work. I would love  to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any  kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it.

The goal is to finish,  even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast!  I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however,  anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I  personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before  I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back  a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use  this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes  relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore  we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s  coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will  suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting  your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*,  that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est  this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est  re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not  pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*.  If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of  thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass  before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*,  and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2  days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est  thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then  add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try. Go here:  [**https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl**](https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl)\\n\\nC204 – Management Communication – **Very Easy Class. 1 Paper, 1 PowerPoint Presentation and Video + 1 Executive Summary**.  This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job  well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qc5bhx6kre051.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e976844dd1590b122f3580644ec34cbf84c5d8)</td>\n",

       "0  Tips for Accelerating Your MBA (or Not!) - Course Tips & Recommended Resources\\nLet me start by saying this. I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips & Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations & Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!  \n",

I transferred 50 credits and work full time (Non IT). Here are my thoughts. Very long read!\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Proof of Completion](https://preview.redd.it/4372ewij6r5b1.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b92d9611f3e8c135bf5b9ea582ef9d423b96d820)\\n\\n[Completed Progress Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/kcx3uvij6r5b1.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82c94084e66ec02294d3990bcebe5cc3bfd4c42a)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, there are a lot of grammatical errors in this. I know. I do not care because I’m too lazy to proof read and fix them.\\n\\nAnyways I finished this degree program in a little over 3 months (105 days to be exact) after transferring about 50 credits. I also work full time with some fairly demanding hours. I do not have any professional IT work experience, but I can navigate around a computer. I also just find the subject matter interesting. I did do the computer science program last year and graduated from that in 1 term in August of 2022. My plan was to go to grad school in Spring of 2023, but I ended up missing all my deadlines and had to wait and apply for Summer/Fall Semester of 2023. I did end up getting accepted to University of Illinois (Urbana Campus) Masters in Computer Science (Data Science Track) for Fall of 2023…which was a shocker because it’s a Top 5 school for computer science. Data science has always been my main goal, but I had all this time in between from when I applied to when the Fall semester would start. Cybersecurity was always on my list of things to learn, but I always had other priorities. Now that I had this gap of time that I could do whatever with, it was a good time for me to get into it. I originally thought about going the route of just doing certs because I already have a CS degree, but I would have just mostly done the same certs that WGU offers in their Cybersecurity program. It would have cost a little less than the actual degree, but still roughly in the same ball park if done in 1 term. Considering that I would be attaining the same certs anyways and the cost is comparable, I figure I might as well do the program and get the degree out of it as well, even though I would likely never use the degree on my resume (with exceptions) as CS “trumps” Cybersecurity. At the least, it helped me stay on track and in focus. I gotta be honest, I enjoyed it alot more than I did computer science and it really got me questioning what path I want to take in my future. I’m still going to grad school (it was a miracle that I even got excepted there), but I may defer to next year (University of Illinois allows that) as I’m thinking I want to take Cyber Security further and dive into different areas. Below is a recap of classes that may or may not help you.\\n\\nHowever, before I get into it, I would just like to point out that I have been working in the construction project management field for the last decade after I finished my first stint (of many) in college (civil engineering). Needless to say, those who are in the engineering/construction field live and die by the schedule so I have a habit of making a schedule for every significant (sometimes insignificant) things I do. I included the schedule I made for this program. I started in March and assigned myself durations to complete the entire program within 1 term and giving myself more weight to what classes I thought would be more demanding and vise-versa. This is the schedule that I would live by and you can see I was on track until I did my 4th class (Networks D325) which is when I started accelerating like crazy. The durations shown are my actuals and the grey bars you see in the gantt chart is my baseline schedule snapshot of what my original schedule was when I first made it. You can compare the 2 and see how much I blew my original schedule out of the water. Most of the classes were done much quicker than my projection. Capstone was the only one that took longer (only by 4 days). Seeing a visual of your progress helps keep you on track and is a motivating factor. I would suggest everyone put a schedule together of some sort.\\n\\n**IT Foundations – D316 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I never had a job in IT, I just grew up using a computer just like everyone else in this program. I felt alot of these questions were really basic questions and if you know your way around a computer you can probably answer most of them without heavy studying. That being said, even though it is a basic certification, I feel like I actually got alot out this course as it made me touch on things that I wouldn’t have otherwise yet is still good to know…things like differences between cpu architecture and differences in memory types, etc… stuff you don’t normally think about. I found those things to be quite interesting. The only PBQ I remember was having to simulate putting together 2 desktops, one being high performance and one being for general office use, you have to pick the right components for each desktop based on the parameters in the question. For studying I partially watched the Total Seminar Series to fill in gaps and did a few Messer practice exams. I also did practice questions from crucialexams dot com. That is one of my favorite resources. Check that site out if you do not already know about it. That was all that was needed.\\n\\n**IT Applications – D317 (17 Days…I didn’t actually spend 17 days on this course, I was inactive for 10 days)**\\n\\n\\- Part 2 of the A+ exam. I have a similar view to how I viewed “IT Foundations” (Part 1 of A+ exam). About the same difficulty as Part 1. However, alot of it seemed like it was common sense considering you didn’t just start using a computer yesterday. Many of the questions you can come up with the right answer by just logically using process of elimination. On my particular exam, it was heavy on questions regarding system tools and commands. Those were the things you are really going to want to pay attention to study for. For studying, I mainly only watched the Total Seminar Series and did some Professor Messer exams and crucial exams.\\n\\n**Legal Issues in Information Security – C841 (10 Days…had 1 revision to do)**\\n\\n\\- I didn’t read any course material. I just read what the assignment was and used outside resources to learn and fill any gaps that I had to complete the assignment. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. I had no interest in this class whatsoever and I just blew through the assignment in a few days. I could have certainly spent longer time and get in depth with the course material, but it just was not important to me and I opted to just get this class done as fast as possible. It is a very easy class if you want it to be.\\n\\n**Networks – D325 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Of all classes, this was one the most demanding for me and the most important. Networking is the foundation to everything in this program and it would behoove you take as much time needed to understand the concepts. I would encourage all of you to build some sort of homelab which can be done dirt cheap. Exam wise, it was difficult because of all the acronyms you need to remember which makes it unnecessarily difficult, but the questions themselves were not tricky and fairly straightforward except the PBQs which are nonsensical in how they are asked. In my PBQs I was asked to set up/configure a network and WIFI and was also asked to troubleshoot a network. The questions were pretty comprehensive across the board and there were a few questions on port numbers, OSI model questions (know what layer does what and what types of programs or hardware pertains to each layer), network topography, wireless standards and a bunch of questions on various plans/policies and a bunch of questions on command line utilities (learn these!). I also had maybe 3 questions on CIDR notation, but I did not have to compute anything. Again, know your acronyms! For this test, I watched the total seminar series, practice exams on crucial exams, a couple of Dion practice exams (only partially) and referenced Mike Meyers’ CompTIA Network+ Certification Passport Book. I really liked this book. His “all in one” book goes more in depth (I have it but didn’t read it much), but the Certification Passport book was much better to look up a topic and briefly read about it when going over things you need to go over. Watching the video series and then using this book as a backup was all I really needed. I did a few quick reviews on crucial exams to build some confidence.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity – C844 (3 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read any course material, I just went straight to the assignment and chipped away at it all day. I thought this class was useful as it gave you an introductory on how to use Wireshark and Nmap. Wireshark is a very cool program. Lots of features to analyze traffic. I did not read the course material for this class as the Nmap portion was easy to figure out without having to really look anything up, but for the Wireshark portion, I only watched the Udemy course: “Getting Started with Wireshark: The Ultimate Hands-On Course” by David Bombal. Excellent course and will provide you with all you need. This guy is very passionate about his Wireshark! I highly recommend this Udemy course and get as much as you can out of it. There are others, but this one was the best one that I was able to come across.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications – D329 (7 Days)**\\n\\n\\- This class is the class that requires the Security+. I found this exam to be fairly easy because there is a lot of overlap from Network+. Just like Network+ there is a lot of memorization of acronyms needed. I apologize as I don’t have much to offer on this because I don’t remember the specifics of what was on it. It is just kind of one big blur. I remember it being shockingly easy compared to Network+ like if you passed Network+ you could probably take this the next day and pass it after reviewing all the common types of attacks. For studying, I just watched the Security+ course on udemy by TIA Education, Andrew Ramdayal. He was actually pretty good, straight to the point on topics with no fluff. Probably not everyone’s “cup of tea”. Also, probably could have gone a little more in depth in some areas, but I would take this over Dion Training any day. Hell, I would take anything over Dion Training. Ramdayal strictly sticks to the objectives laid out exactly the way Comptia has their test laid out. It was easy to goto each one and pick the things you need to work on. I did no practice exams. Went straight to the official exam after I finished the video series. I do remember that one of the PBQs was setting up a firewall.\\n\\n**Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity – D431 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read the course material, I just went straight to the assignment and used outside resources and Udemy to guide me. I actually found this course to be quite fun. You will have (2) PAs and an OA to do. The first PA is that you have to create an investigation plan per best practices. The 2nd PA was fun as you will need to run a program called “Autopsy”, where you have to analyze a disk image and put a story together about what crime will likely be committed based on the evidence you found when doing your forensics. As far as the OA goes, know your tools, Windows/Linux/Mac log types and folder locations, what different parts of your Windows registry does and the various Federal Laws (critical). The preassessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty and style. That was really the only study aid I used.\\n\\n**Information Systems Security – C845 (10 Days)**\\n\\nYou will need to pass your SSCP for this one. I wrote a post on this class before. However here is a brief TLDR recap from my previous post on couple of things for you to remember:\\n\\n\\- The SSCP Practice Exam Book by Nick Mitropoulous is a fairly good representation of the exam and is the only thing I used.\\n\\n\\- This was an easier version of Security+. If you passed A+, Net+ and Sec+ than this exam will be fairly easy.\\n\\n\\- questions seem to be spread out evenly across the board for the most part, with the exception that there were very few questions on “cryptography” (I had maybe 5 or 6 that I can remember), but there were seemingly a bunch of questions regarding “identity access”. They weren’t difficult, but that section definitely had the most weight. Be sure you know the concepts behind the “who I am”, “what I know”, “what I have” principles as there were a lot of questions on that.\\n\\n\\- There were no trick questions and you don’t have to worry about remembering acronyms\\n\\n\\- Don’t psych yourself out. The most obvious answers are like the correct answers. There were no trick questions.\\n\\n\\- This is very important, read the question very carefully and really think about your answer when it comes to the “best”, “worst” and “most likely/unlikely” questions. These questions have multiple right answers so they can be kind of difficult. You have to consider how you are answering that question because you will get questions like “What is the best course of action in this (insert scenario)? Choose: A, B, C or D. Lets say the answer “A” and “B” are both definitely correct in the scenario, but choice “B” might be a step that you would do in part of step described in choice “A”. So the answer would be “A”. These are not trick questions, but you really need to think how answers integrate with others to pick the best choice. These questions were probably the most “trickiest”, but if you know to look out for them and think logically, you will be ok\\n\\n**Introduction to Cryptography – D334 (8 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed my first OA attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. Lots of memorization in this class. Just like all the other threads you will see about this course. Shawn’s Course Study Guide/Notes found in course chatter is all you need. The book is ok, but is pretty dry. Shawn did a very good job on his study guide. Its all you need! Get familiar with that and then do his practice exams for each chapter. You will pass. The PA and his practice exams were pretty close to the OA in terms of difficulty and style of question. Lots of memorization. I’m probably in the minority here, but I thought the subject matter was very interesting. I think about this stuff when I download programs and visit websites and stuff. It only took me about a week to finish this class, but I got pretty immersed in it. The concept of cryptography is pretty much engrained in me. Regarding the exam, questions seemed to be more skewed towards PKI, Wireless Encryption Protocols and Tunneling. These seem to show up the most on my exam and there were very few questions on blockchain/crypto currency and lightweight cryptography. The rest of the topics were pretty evenly distributed. It was a good introductory course in my opinion.\\n\\n**Managing Information Security – C843 (4 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Didn’t read any course material. Just read and did the assignment. You will need to do an incident analysis and response as well as a risk assessment. There is a lot of crap you are going to have to discuss and write about, such as legal acts, tools, techniques for gathering and analyzing, examination process etc…. It’s a very annoying assignment. I did not care for it in the slightest.\\n\\n**Cyber Defense and Countermeasures – D340 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- The CYSA+ is required for this class. WGU is enforcing a policy where accelerators can only have one class approved at a time and the program must be taken in a specific order….atleast that is what my mentor told me and won’t budge on it. The reason I’m mentioning this is because the order in which they have you do classes makes sense and does a good job preparing you systematically in my opinion. Every class builds on each other and the time you are required to take the CYSA+ is the right time. That being said, I felt the CYSA+ is a much harder version of the Security+. It went much deeper in security concepts compared to the Sec+ and I found some aspects of it to be rather difficult. However, all the Comptia exams you have taken so far preps you for the CYSA+. The cryptography class taken before this class, covers most of the cryptography questions on this exam. The digital forensics course that we have to take before this was sufficient enough to not have to do in depth studying for this exam. For studying, I just blew through the Total Seminar CYSA+ Series on Udemy and did a quick run through with things I was not familiar with the CYSA+ Certification Passport Book by Bobby Rogers. I did not do any practice exams. My lack of study was due to me being over confident. The PBQs were fun though. From what I remember, they all had to do with using nmap to determine what specific servers did and log trouble shooting. That was pretty much the gist of all the PBQs. They were pretty straight forward. <750 is considered a fail…I passed with a 751 on the first attempt. Probably should have done some practice exams to get that score up a little. Pass is a pass!\\n\\n**Managing Cloud Security – D320 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed this OA by a slim margin the first attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. The instructor for this course was a relief because he just let me do it after I told him I reviewed the book the previous day. Normally they make you do a bulls\\\\\\*\\\\\\*t generic study plan and make you jump through a bunch hoops. Apparently the course was redone and a new exam had been made following the CCSP text book. This test was a doozy as there are 125 questions. However, just going over the book is sufficient. It was for me anyways. A lot of it will be a review which makes studying quite quick. It followed the book quite nicely. There were no curve balls and the questions were pretty straight forward. I’d probably say that the most sh\\\\\\*tty thing was having to memorize the various laws and frameworks. This is a must! You also need to make sure you are familiar with all the different frameworks and standards, quantitative risk assessment, uptime institute, data lifecycle, SOC report types, Software Development Lifecycle and Stride Threat Model.\\n\\n**Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis – D332 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\* This is taken from a previous post I made after I finished this class. Im reposting it here so you don’t have to search for it.\\*\\n\\n\\- By far the most difficult exam in my opinion. This was the only Comptia test that I failed the first time. All the Comptia exams kind of built off the previous and you could make your way around the exams without feeling completely lost. Pentest+ was different, the previous exams will help you very little. The things you really have to know are the commonly used tools and what they do. There is a lot of them and there are bunch of questions like “which tool would use for this?”. NMAP commands and syntax (very heavy in this), SQL Injection/XSS types and deciphering vulnerability logs. Make sure you have a semi decent grasp on SQL in general. ALL the different types of attacks that are commonly used. There are some that came up that I did not come across in the book. If you know the main/commonly used ones, you should be ok for the most part. Learn scripting! You will not need to write any per se, but you might as well learn because there are questions where you need to decipher/interpret various scripts and therefore need to know how to write them. Make sure you know the different syntax. For example, know how an array is written in PowerShell (there is a question in the exam where you will need to figure this out). Learn the common commands for PS, Bash and Linux. There was a couple questions having to do with common HTTP methods. There were not really any questions regarding the different laws. Definitely do not need to focus on that. You should know them anyways if you had just done the Managing Cloud class. The PBQs were medium difficulty. From what I remember, they were as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n1. Mix and match: You will get like a single line of script (or payloads rather) and you have to pick what kind of vulnerability it is and then you need to pick a method of remediation. Need to know your scripting and various types of SQL injection. This is critical. There will be like (10) of these you have to do.\\n\\n2. Scripting: On the right, there will be a block of incomplete scripting. On the left, you will have multiple options of code snippets that you will need to use to plug into the incomplete areas of the code. The code is prewritten for you. You just need to place the right snippet in the correct blank spot where the code is incomplete. There are twice as many code snippets then there are blank spots so you can’t just use the process of elimination. You kind of have to have some sort of clue. Also, the code might be in Bash, Python or Ruby. You have to be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n3. NMAP Interpretation: You will get a block of an NMAP scan result. Like above, you will have a bunch of options on the right hand side. You will be asked to put together the correct NMAP command to get the results shown in the scan output. Part 2 is that you will need to also pick the trouble areas (attack vectors) based on what the scan shows. There will be a list of options for you to choose from.\\n\\n4. Investigate Login Page: You will be given a login page of which you can view the certificate, source code and cookies. You will need to determine if any of those 3 things have issues. If they do, you will need to specify and provide a solution.\\n\\nThe Sybex book is by far the best book for this course. I did not care for the Sybex books in the other courses. Finding a good video series was difficult. I’m a total seminars fan, but this one did not do it for me. I hate the Dion materials in general and I’ve tried others on Udemy and Youtube and none of them were doing it for me. Another great book is Pentest+ for dummies. Very engaging. Lastly, you must spend time and do labs to understand the concepts. You’re really shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t. Look into tryhackmeDOTcom as well. I took the exam 3 days after registering for the class after a quick review. I thought I would be ok and I wanted to quickly get it over with. I found out in the first 10 questions and the PBQs that I was very underprepared. I took the test again a week later after intense studying and passed.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project – C769 (9 Days)**\\n\\nEh, it is what it is. A bunch of busy work. No need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look in WGUs database that has\\n\\nall the previous capstones that were rewarded for “excellence” and look at them for inspiration, ideas and see how they put theirs together. There is also a dedicated capstone page that will provide templates and samples for you so you will not be totally lost. I chose to propose implementing an “Insider Threat Management System” for a pharmaceutical company based on a scenario that I made up. There are 3 parts to the capstone: submitting what you will propose, writing the actual proposal and writing a post implementation report/reflection. None of it is difficult, it is just time consuming as they are asking for you to include a lot of stuff. 70% of part 3 is going to ask you for the same thing in part 2. I literally just cut and pasted the applicable sections from part 2 and changed the wording to past tense as part 3 is supposed to occur after you implemented your system. There will be a portion where you have to use outside references and cite books or whatever…just goto researchgateDOTcom query whatever subject you’re doing, pick however many you need from the search results that pertain and just read the abstracts and tie them into your proposal and cite them (already provided when you select a paper to view). This should save you some time. You are also going to need to turn in some sort of “deliverable” whether it be code sample, UML diagrams, operations manual, etc… I would suggest just doing a simple process diagram and explain each process. Its quick and easy and satisfies that requirement. If you goto apps dot diagrams dot net, you can build a nice one for free. If you want to be ultra creative and spend all your time doing the capstone on some crazy and innovative idea, all good. However, I would suggest you put in the bare minimum effort and move on, finish this program and get started on your new career asap. I WOULD NOT put any effort into this capstone! WGU doesn’t require it (they are just looking that you have all the things in their rubric). This project is not beneficial in any way and its not like you would be using it for a portfolio or anything. Do not waste your time on it. Read the requirements make sure you include those requirements and go.\\n\\n**List of exams from least difficult to most difficult:**\\n\\n1. A+ part 2\\n\\n2. A+ part 1\\n\\n3. SSCP\\n\\n4.

I do not know how difficult it will be. Can’t be that hard. I’ll provide a writeup when I do take it\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2 things that may or may not help you…**\\n\\n1. There is a lot of information on the internet about how to study. Reading the text book through and through and taking notes is not efficient nor is it the best way and it is what is called “passive learning”. It is more efficient to do active learning. Which means…well…do active things when you’re learning…flash cards, practice exams, simulate teaching the material, physical home lab, etc…\\n\\nWhen it comes to studying especially for exams, my normal study habit is to watch a video series on 2x the speed or the fastest it can be where I can clearly understand it. You are trying to get an overview and have familiarity with everything. The video is visual and helps things stick. You’ll be surprised how much you can pick up. I will not take notes, just jot down questions of things I need to go over as they come up while I am watching. When Im done with the series, I will then look those question topics up and determine the what, why, and how of it to understand that particular topic/concept. Then I will generally do a practice exam, note question topics that I am not familiar with to look up when done. I will also go over the questions missed and then repeat then go over the same or another practice exam. It doesn’t matter if the test is not that similar in style/difficulty to what you are taking if you take the time to understand the concept. Comprehensive practice exams is my preference but anything that is “active” is good. You will figure out what works best for you. Just don’t read a book front to back, take notes in between and try to memorize it unless you like being inefficient and wasting your time…unless that is what is best for you. Lol\\n\\n2. Most of you already know this, but ChatGPT is your friend! By far the most valuable tool for me. It can be abused or it can be used as an extremely well-functioning learning tool. You are only hurting yourself if you want to try and use it for other purposes. When I would study my material and need to understand a topic like OSI models for example, I would write something like “Explain to me like a child what the OSI layers are and what they do. Also provide me an analogy.”. I cannot tell you how easy it was for me to pick things up when Chatgpt was able to explain things to me like im a 5 year old and provide me an easy to understand analogy. Analogies was a game changer for me. If you still don’t understand, you can have full conversations with it and ask it questions until you do understand it. Something like “I don’t understand, why would it do \\\\\\*this when it seems to do \\*that? You said \\*this. What is difference between \\*this and \\*that?”! Like full on conversations. Try it right now and see what I’m talking about! Use it to your advantage for learning. It is an amazing resource! Word of caution though, it is not always right depending on what you are asking or telling it what to do so when in doubt verify it.\\n\\n**My thoughts overall:**\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking: “ MmMMMmGoOoOo! BuT, bUt, BuT, YoU JuSt RuShEd ThRoUgH iT aNd DiD NoT LeArN AnyThInG! mMmGoOoOoOo!”. I learned the amount of material I needed to learn to get through the entire program and have probably come out with just as much as everyone else who graduated regardless of time spent. More than others in some cases. I also feel like I have a gotten a very solid foundation out of it, which was my expectation. \\n\\nHere is the thing, I would rather blow through the program and pay minimum tuition of $4k (plus get all my bonus certs!), continue learning and fill in gaps after completion at my leisure vs taking my sweet time and pump out the program in 3-4 terms and pay $12k-$16k. I guarantee I will have far surpassed that person’s knowledge on an intellectual and practical level by the time he/she is done. My learning will never stop, but my tuition will as soon as I can make it stop! Time is money. Massive acceleration is the way to go if it can be done…in my opinion. That is the beauty of WGU.\\n\\nThat being said, I feel like I’m just beginning, in that I’ve only dipped my toe and now the real learning begins. Now that I have the time and am not at the mercy of my term date lest I pay another 4k, I will go back and fill in my gaps and really start doing real world practical stuff and labs that I did not do. I did build a pretty intricate homelab that I will be using heavily. Anyways, I feel like this program did an excellent job in providing a solid foundation and I do mean excellent. I do not regret it in any way and I am in many ways more excited about this then I was with the Computer Science degree. That’s all I got. Good luck to you all!

Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  My Fun 41-Day MBA Journey - SO WORTH IT!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\*This is about my MBA journey, I hope to inspire, but don't be hard on yourself if your accelerated path is different\\*\\n\\nI was highly motivated and inspired by the post I read in this Reddit group from Sleyk2010, along with many other accelerators in this group and a few FB groups. Before I chose WGU for my MBA, I had my share of skepticism. I looked at numerous online and Brick and Mortar schools (I received my Bachelor’s from a traditional B&M University). I completed my BSBM in a little over two years for a 5-year program (about 18 months ago), so I was already used to acceleration. I could have accelerated my Bachelor’s degree even more, but of course, I could only go as fast as the university allowed. I had to go the full 6 or 8 weeks for a course, even if I completed all of my exams, papers, and reading ahead of time. This led to me doubling and tripling my course load each semester. What drew me to WGU was that I CAN DICTATE MY PATH. I knew that I had a hunger for reading books, writing papers, and retaining the coursework. I am just maniacal like that, so I don’t expect everybody to feel the way I do about school. I knew I could crush my goals through acceleration because I know myself well enough and have been able to do it in the past. School is actually fun for me and if that makes me weird or crazy, I will proudly own that, lol.\\n\\nAll of this being said, everyone approaches school at their own individual pace and I am not writing this to declare that everybody will complete their Master’s degree in a matter of weeks or a few months. Everyone’s motivation is also not the same and how a person approaches school impacts how they set their pace. There is no way to “cheat” a degree. Everyone gets the SAME courses and the same coursework. Less than 10% of students accelerate at a pace where they can achieve their degree in well under one term/semester. The norm is that students will take two terms or more. Be clear that it IS TOTALLY OKAY. There is no “correct amount of time” to finish a degree. It is totally up to you based on your motivation, the time you dedicate to it, and your ability to absorb the coursework.  No matter how quickly you finish, be proud that you finished and that it took some hard work to get there.\\n\\nSo, let me get to the fun part. The Reddit and Facebook groups are helpful and great motivators for those who decide to come to WGU. It is a great school, properly accredited, and VERY reputable. WGU is also very relevant for the working adult and career-minded individuals who want to advance their careers. I am laying out a full course-by-course write-up of how I approached each course and how I successfully passed it. Let me be clear, this is how I did it and what worked for me, so by no means will this be a blanket approach that works for everyone. It is a lot of hard work and some frustrating days will be ahead, but trust me, obtaining your MBA is doable if you stay focused and put in the work. I don’t have any “tricks,” no rubrics, no papers to use for sampling, and no study guides to pass along. For the sake of academic integrity, I won’t risk myself or anyone putting a stain on the school or me for giving people the easy way out. If I had to do the work, so do you. I am offering some guidance and motivation for students in the program. Hopefully, acceleration will work well for you all too!!!!\\n\\nAgain, I don’t have any work to pass along, so please don’t inquire. If anyone feels the need to minimize and discredit accelerators, keep that negative energy somewhere because accelerators are the exception, not the norm, so this is NOT easy. As you will see many accelerators say, they will not apologize for busting their ass to obtain their degree faster than others. Some people are brainiacs, some are overachievers, and some are both. That is not a bad thing. Also, some Program Mentors are better than others and will be supportive of your path. My mentor was AWESOME and I came in with a game plan and strategy that she backed me up on. I made it clear that I was accelerating and would NOT be in the program longer than 45 days because I am on a mission. I am maniacal in my approach and putting in 40 hours or more a week outside of work to do schoolwork is not a problem for me. I can rest when I finish my degree. I do not suggest this for everyone. Plus, I have an empty nest with all my adult children out on their own. I had some downtime at work and figured no time was better than the present to get my MBA and advance my career. I will start with the Three Commandments of WGU, which I will cite as a source courtesy of SLEYK2010 himself (which are great by the way!!)\\n\\n*“The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.”*\\n\\n***To add as an addendum to the commandments, use Grammarly or some type of paper editing application for your papers. They will eliminate grammar and spelling errors on all of your papers. It is your best friend. Also, use Quizlet, they have very useful study guides to use for the courses.***\\n\\n**\\*Disclaimer\\* This is not the order I TOOK the courses in, they are in numerical order. My game plan was to do all of the PA (writing courses) first and switch my brain over to the analytical courses next (ones with OAs). I did C213 and C214 Back-toBack because there was a lot of cross-over between the two courses. I  saved C215 and C207 for last because of the cross-over and because I wanted to close out with the OA and PA course (C207).**\\n\\n**On to the courses!!!**\\n\\n**ORA1** – **Orientation** – One PA\\n\\nDo what you feel is best for the orientation. If you have done a lot of research on the academic program before orientation opens up, this “course” won’t be tedious. Follow the rubric, keep it simple, and peruse the “coursework.” It simply gives an overview of what to expect as a student and ensures that you are prepared to start your program. Be as realistic as you can be when asked about how much of a time commitment you can truly make each week to your schoolwork.\\n\\n**C200** – **Managing Organizations and Leading People** \\- Two OAs (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nYou will start with what is called the “Signature Themes Assessment.” It does not take hella long to do and when you complete it, save the PDF. Task #1 is a paper centered around the assessment that you took. PLEASE FOLLOW THE RUBRIC when you write the paper. Task #2 focuses on leadership that you experienced in your career. It can be a past or present company. You won’t be able to use actual names for the company or the person (or people) that you write about. Have fun with it, the assignment will be about your life experiences, so it will be easy to speak to either way. I finished both papers in one day, I just got diarrhea of the brain and my hands did the rest. This is one course where I will say that even though there is some reading that is available, it won’t be of much use. The readings are pretty much common sense type of stuff and won’t make much of an impact on the papers that you have to write in this course. Just get straight to writing and have fun with it.\\n\\n**C202** – **Managing Human Capital** – One OA (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nThis class was pretty straightforward in my eyes. I assume we are all adults here and have been a part of a workplace environment that involved employee interaction. A lot of common sense and work experience type of content is in this course. The technical aspects of this course (terminology and concepts) are in the reading materials and there is a Quizlet (get acquainted with this site, it is VERY helpful) that is very helpful for the course. I did some of the reading, but a lot of it was stuff I covered extensively in undergrad, so I didn’t have to deep dive into the reading materials. This is the Human Resources course of the MBA program. I took the pre-assessment and reviewed my weak areas. I skimmed the readings and reviewed a few Quizlets to help me prepare for the OA. It took me about two days total to do the reading, study, and pass the OA. Again, the course is not a beast, you will know more about the course than you will think. Some people may take longer to get through the course and trust me, THAT IS OKAY.\\n\\n**C204** – **Management Communication** – Three PAs -Two Papers and One PPT&Video (Another Straightforward and Easy Course) \\n\\nThis course was actually a lot of fun. Tedious, but easy enough. There are some reading materials for this course, but honestly, they don’t provide much help for the actual tasks. I skimmed the materials to see what use I could make of them, but I was able to dive right into the tasks. Task #1 is a paper, but it will be constructed in a weird manner. The course is about professional communication in the workplace. You will be writing emails from the perspective of being a business owner or a supervisor. You will be writing emails to your staff, a business partner, and the stakeholders. The three emails will be fun to make, so don’t overthink the assignment.  Task #2 is a Powerpoint and Video. WGU uses Panopto for video creation. If you have never used it before (most of us probably have not), they provide instructional videos on how to use it. You should have access to Panopto as a student, but if you don’t, reach out to the IT department, and they will rectify that for you pretty quickly, usually within 24 hours. The video only needs to cover the points in the rubric and your PPT should be an outline of the presentation. Mine took over 15 minutes, but I am a classroom trainer by trade, so it was in my wheelhouse. Most people can truly do their presentation in less than 10 minutes. Follow the rubric to ensure you cover all the points they want you to cover and you will be fine. Task 3 is an executive summary. A one-page paper and you are good to go. All three tasks can be done by jumping in head first while the reading materials provide just a little help for the papers. I was able to complete all three tasks over two days.\\n\\n**C206** – **Ethical Leadership** – Three PAs (Straightforward but VERY tedious course)\\n\\nI did not personally find this class to be “hard,” but it is very labor-intensive. This course is similar to C200 in that you will be using another assessment called the “Ethical Lens Inventory” to start you off before your first task. There are 3 PAs and they are a doozy, lol. I honestly had fun with this class because I had a few ethics courses in undergrad and had to apply them in real life at work. The reading materials are enlightening and helpful but don’t be intimidated by any of the reading. A lot of the reading is stuff you have previously or currently face in your workplace and your life. I had a LOT of ammo to use for these papers, so the writing was pretty easy for me. Task #1 is to write about a leader you admire, a leader you know, or a famous leader. It does not matter; just make sure you cite any sources if you use someone you don’t know personally. Task #2 is focused on social responsibility, ethics in the workplace, and ethical leaders. You may find that your work experiences will be very useful for this paper. Life experiences can be the best teacher. Task 3 is a paper about leadership and the code of ethics. All three tasks will include life experiences and ethics concepts, so the reading materials are helpful. PLEASE make sure you follow the rubric to the letter for each task because it can be easy to miss a section and have your paper sent back for revision. I spent one day reading the materials a bit and two days doing the papers. Three days total. I wrote over 15 pages for each task, but trust me, many of you can do them in 10 pages, give or take a page. I do like to write, so I tend to write with extensive details, but if you like to keep things simple and just answer each section in a rubric, DO THAT. Writing a novel is not necessary, lol. I did get two excellence awards for 2 of the tasks I wrote for this course, so the long ass days of writing were worth it for me.   \\n\\n**C207** – **Data-Driven Decision Making** \\- Two PAs and One OA (Hard course for most, not very straightforward)\\n\\nIf any of you have read up on this class on Reddit or Facebook, you will see that this class beats people up. I can understand why it does. This is the Statistics class of the program. No real reading materials are provided for this course, which is why I say it is not so straightforward. There are TONS of PPTs and videos from the course instructors for this course. USE THEM. I personally love statistics and data, so I didn’t feel intimidated by the class. There is not a lot of math used in this course, it is heavy on concepts and statistical methods. Again, there are tons of resources in the course from the CIs, such as videos, study guides, and PPTs. Review them multiple times if you have to until you start to comprehend the material. Reach out to a CI if you need assistance, they are there to help. Quizlet is also helpful for the OA in this course because you will be using a lot of terminology. For task #1, you are forming a hypothesis that you will have to analyze for task #2. Once the evaluators approve task #1, you can move to task #2. The course will provide the framework for all the statistical methods you can use for your hypothesis. Most people chose a T-Test or ANOVA. I chose linear regression. I only chose it because it made more sense for my hypothesis. Use a topic you are familiar with for your hypothesis, it will make the task less painful. I used home values and mortgage rates because I work in the financial world, but I easily could have used sports for a topic too. For task #2, they provide videos and PPTs for each test that you perform and will show you how to input them in Excel. You will need at least 30 data points to use for the assignment but trust me, once you gather the info, it gets easier from there. Once you run the analysis in Excel, you will be writing a short paper (probably no more than 5 or 6 pages) that covers about 6 or 7 bullet points. As always, follow the rubric and keep it simple. For the OA, they provide a pretty good study guide and flashcards for the terminology, but Quizlet is an excellent supplement for this as well. The pre-assessment does not align heavily with the OA, but use it as a starting point for the areas that you do need to cover for the OA. My Program Mentor let me push this class to the end before the Capstone because I wanted to follow the Operations Management course (there is a lot of crossover between the courses). I honestly had fun with this class because I love Stats and Math (I am a math tutor on the side), so I didn’t lose my mind in the course. It took me about five days to read and watch the course materials, do the tasks, study, and pass the OA. Realistically, this course can easily take many weeks for people to complete and that is okay. It is not easy for most and you truly want to comprehend and retain what you learn in the course. \\n\\n**C211** – **Global Economics for Managers** – One PA (Somewhat hard course for most)\\n\\nMany people have stated this course kicked their butt and I can see why. There is a lot of technical stuff to cover in this course and if you are not a fan of economics or did not cover it much in undergrad, this class will be brutal. For me, I like this type of stuff and still use a lot of the micro and macro Econ knowledge I learned in undergrad, especially being in the financial industry. There are reading materials, study guides, videos, and PPTs available for this course and they are very helpful materials to use. Focus on the areas where you are the weakest because you don’t want to be in the dark in important areas that you don’t know. There are a lot of terms and concepts that you need to know and the study guides are very helpful in covering what you need to know. Use Quizlet too, it supplements the course material tremendously. There are helpful YouTube videos for Econ as well, so just know that there are many ways to skin a cat here to find helpful information. The pre-assessment somewhat aligns with the OA, so spot your weak areas and drill those down before the OA. I felt the class was not hard for me because of what I came into the class with, but I know that this class can be a lot of work for many. It is not a race; take as much time as you need to understand the course. It took me about three days to complete the course, but just try to get as much as you can out of the course and do it at your pace.   \\n\\n**C212** – **Marketing** – One HUGE PA (Straightforward and somewhat easy course)\\n\\nThis course was easy in terms of understanding the materials but the final paper is long as hell. You really have to APPLY what you learn in the course. I still remembered many marketing concepts from my Bachelor’s program, so I didn’t have to spend far too much time in the book. The concepts are easy to understand and there is no test, so just dig around a little bit in the reading materials for information that you need. There is no way to sugarcoat this, the paper is very long. It will likely be the longest individual paper you write in the program. With that being said, try to have fun with the paper. Many of the areas you have to cover on the rubric are based on your opinion of what you would do if you made marketing decisions for a business. Some of the technical stuff is in the readings, but a good portion of the paper is based on what you would do to market a business. My paper was about 20 pages, but I didn’t feel it was brutal. All in, I completed the course in 2 days. The writing was a lot, but not painful. \\n\\n**C213** \\- **Accounting for Decision Makers** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most, but reasonable)\\n\\nThis course is very technical and if you aren’t familiar with accounting, it may beat you up a little bit. However, if you have any accounting knowledge from your bachelor’s programs, this course will not feel so brutal. Being the nerdy dork that I am, I think accounting is fun. I still retained a lot of what I learned from undergrad and apply it in real life because I do my own accounting for my side business. I still got a lot out of the class and brushed up on concepts that I had learned before, so the class was not hard for me. With all of this being said, there are reading materials (especially the Hawaiian shirt guy who had a video at the end of each chapter) and a few other videos and study guides in the course. The materials are very helpful, trust me. YouTube even has a few basic accounting videos (just like YouTube has for Economics) that are useful. Whatever you do, just make sure you find materials that help you understand accounting concepts effectively. There is a lot of technical work to nail down for the OA and you will want to know and understand basic accounting concepts. There is hardly any math on the OA, and the minimal math used is not hard. Know your debits and credits, the accounting formula, and understand accrual accounting. Quizlet is also a useful tool to supplement the course materials. The course only took me two days to complete and pass the OA, but that is because I already knew the material and could grasp the new stuff. This is a course you may find will be useful in the future, so try to get something out of the class, no matter if it takes you weeks to get through it. Use the CIs if you are struggling because some of the concepts may initially feel foreign.\\n\\n**C214** – **Financial Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most)\\n\\nI won’t sugar coat it, this course is not as fun for me as the rest, lol. I don’t mind finance as a whole, it is just sooooo tedious. If you don’t have a finance calculator (I have had one for many years), make sure you get one. The preferable calculator to use is the TI-30 BAII. If you use any other kind of calculator, you are asking for your life to be filled with agony. Learn the basic functions of the calculator. The course provides a good video on how to use it as well as YouTube. However you do it, just make sure you know how to use the bloody thing. The great thing about this course is that the pre-assessment and the OA will provide all of the formulas that you need to use. You don’t have to remember the formulas, but you do need to know how to apply them and plug them into the calculator. This PA has much more math than the OA, so you will want to focus more on the concepts of Finance and how they apply to the real world. This course has some VERY helpful study guides, PPTs, and videos from the CIs. Quizlets are also very useful. Watch those darn videos 100 times if you have to until it sticks. You will not want to skate through this course, many people fail the OA, and many fail more than once. You can’t BS through this course, you will need to use the materials to grasp the concepts and enlist the help of a CI if you truly get stuck. The math part of the class was the easy part for me, I spent more time focusing on the application of finance principles and that was very fulfilling. I was able to learn things that I did not cover in my finance course in undergrad. I completed the course and passed the OA in a total of 4 days, but I came in with a pretty good foundation that really helped me retain the stuff I learned in the course. Remember, GO AT YOUR PACE. Once you feel confident about the materials, take that OA and put it behind you. \\n\\n**C215** – **Operations Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard Course)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I like this course the least, lol. The main reason is that I was not as passionate about the material. With that being said, I got the most out of this course. I learned a hell of a lot. There is quite a bit of cross-over with C207 because the manufacturing industry utilizes a lot of statistical methods (like Six Sigma, Lean, etc.).  I studied my ass off in this class and completing it was the most fulfilling. The reading materials are helpful, but they are dense and probably more dry than most of the reading. The study guides in the course from the CIs, Quizlet, and some of the reading from the book got me through the class. It is honestly that simple. The materials are there, they are straightforward, they apply to the OA, and they are tools to help you succeed in the course. It took about five days to learn the materials, study, and pass the OA. This course tends to stop people in their tracks and they drag through this class for over a month or more. Don’t be scared of the course. Dive in, learn the material, and don’t stop and start the course to drag it out. That is how you lose your momentum and the course ends up feeling sluggish. Operations Management will be very good material to retain and for people in factories or other manufacturing fields, you will be very comfortable with the coursework. I will also add that this course is one of the most important courses to use as a foundation for the Capstone.\\n\\n**C216** – **MBA Capstone** – Three PAs - PPT & Video, One Huge Paper, and 3-part final task (Very Tedious Course but soooooo much fun)\\n\\nWoohoo!!!!! You made it to the end!!!! You will now apply all the valuable teachings from your other courses and roll them all into the Capstone. The Capstone is centered around a Marketplace Business Simulation. You will be the owner and decision-maker of a business and have six total quarters to make sound business decisions and get a simulation score of at least 0.001 or higher. If you fail, you have the take the simulation all over again. Trust me, you do not want to be set back because of that. Before you do the simulation, it wouldn’t hurt to read the Conscious Capitalism articles they provide. There is no book for the course, just the articles. The CIs provide videos on how to do each task and they may be helpful for each of you to use when figuring out how to structure your presentation and paper. Now, on to the Simulation. You are going to do the simulation for three quarters and pause. You will assess your business and review your decisions so far (you cannot go back and change them once you submit the quarter). Do all of Quarter 4, but do NOT submit it (or else you will make your life hell and screw up the simulation for yourself). Once you complete (but not submit) Quarter 4, it is time to do the PPT and video presentation for task #1. You are a business owner and should act as such, so wear some business casual clothes for your Panopto presentation. You are giving an update of the business through Q4 and telling stakeholders your business plan while asking for more money to invest for the next few quarters. Don’t stress over the PPT, the course provides a template for the presentation PPT and you just have to fill in the relevant information from your business. Most people can do their presentation in 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes. Mine was 40 minutes, but that is because I live for classroom teaching and presentations. It is fun and I definitely overdid it. Once you complete Task #1 and submit it, NOW you can go in and submit Quarter 4. You have to submit task #1 before you do that so the evaluators can go in and open the final two quarters. Now you will work on completing Quarters 5 and 6. My best advice is to be a conscious business. Your decisions should be centered around that because that is what this is all about, right? You can get a jump on task #3 while you wait for task #1 to be reviewed. Task #3 is a reflection paper on what you have learned in the MBA program, make a S.M.A.R.T. goal, how it will be used for your future career path, and include “career and education artifacts.” You will also submit your LinkedIn profile. The rubric will break it all down for you. You can easily complete task #3 in a few hours with the paper and the gathering of your artifacts. Beware though, you CAN NOT submit task #3 until you have completed AND submitted task #2. Just keep it on ice until you submit task #2 and submit task #3 a minute later.  Once you complete all six quarters, you will review your business results in Quarter 7. From this point, you will gather everything you need for the final paper in task #2. Task #2 will be long (mine was 20 pages), but there will be screenshots of graphs and other charts included, so it will not be 100% written words, lol. Follow the trusty rubric and just rock out that last huge paper. You ran the business and made all the decisions, so you will have all of the intimate details of the simulation and will be the best person to speak on it, so own it and tell your story! Whew! Submit task #2, then submit task #3 and wait for the last evaluations of the MBA program.   The Capstone took me about nine days.\\n\\nThe MBA program took me 41 days, but I feel if I didn’t have to go out of town a few times, give myself a couple of days of rest, and not lose a day to revise a task (Task #3 of the Capstone, my silly self did not upload one of my artifacts), I would have completed it in less than 30. I will still take it though and I am very proud that I still crushed my goal.\\n\\nOnce everything is graded and you get confirmation that your final task passed, you can now scream to the world….. YOU ARE AN MBA GRAD!!!!!! \\n\\nSoak in the moment, celebrate your achievement, thank your mentor(who will submit you for graduation), thank your family and friends who have been in your corner, and pat yourself on the back for what you accomplished. Then, wait about 7-10 days for the WGU Owl and Confetti to appear on your WGU profile page, which will officially confirm you are a grad and can no longer access your courses. The road is not easy and some may take longer to get to the finish line than others, but once you finish, you are a winner. No one will be able to take it away from you!!!\\n\\nGO OWLS!!! Remember, you can do it with effort and motivation too :-)\\n\\nON TO THE MSML WHEN MY NEXT TERM BEGINS!!!!!!!  \n",

Full accelerated-BSIT Write Up\\n**Intro**  \\nHi Night Owls! I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and I've been here since the summer of 2023. I'm a 22y/o based out of the east coast (US). WGU changed my life. In this post I'm going to share my story and the result of 18 months of hard work! I'm also going to provide you guys with the best tips and pieces of information I've gathered from countless hours of researching the job market, reading r/resumes and other related subreddits, news articles, interviews, etc. I'm making this post as a way of reflecting on the past 2 years of my life and to give back to the community by sharing information & my story. My DMs are open for anybody who has questions or would just like to chat!\\n\\n**Background**  \\nI was working as a security guard before WGU and I had a lot of free-time at work to spend on my laptop. I knew I wanted a degree but couldn't afford the tuition and didn't like the idea of graduating much later than my friends I went to HS with. WGU offered me a solution to both of these problems, and I was able to complete a LOT of school work during work hours (I had explicit permission from my manager). This was an amazing opportunity for me because I still lived at home with my parents and was being paid between $17-20/hr to complete school work. If this sounds like something that interests you, I encourage you to apply to Securitas, Allied Universal, GardaWorld, or Prosegur. Look for \"warm body\" sites- locations where you're paid to just sit at a desk in an empty building. Overnight and weekend jobs are great for this sort of thing as well. A good resource for getting into the security industry is r/securityguards. You won't need to carry a firearm if that's a concern of yours. Also, be advised, some states require you to have a security guard license. Personally I didn't have to.\\n\\nI knew I wanted to study IT so choosing which degree program to enroll in wasn't difficult for me. I chose to do the accelerated BSIT->MSITM program and had a clear idea in mind of the career path I wanted to take. I cannot overstate the importance of doing research on career trajectories from different degrees. The [WGU website](https://www.wgu.edu/) does a decent job of providing degree and career information from whichever degree you choose, but the WGU website alone is simply not enough. Interview/talk with people in the field you're interested in, possibly shadow them, start projects of your own- it is entirely your responsibility to create a plan going into this. Changing your degree program later down the road is completely acceptable but do understand the consequences associated with that (time, money, etc). On a separate note, it's a good idea to organize your school materials and whatnot prior to starting. I created a free [Notion](http://www.notion.com) to keep track of my schedule, save informative Reddit posts and other course materials, track my progress, create reminders, store documents, etc. Another benefit of learning Notion and using it was that I was able to put this tool on my resume.\\n\\n**Pre-WGU**  \\nI took as many courses on [Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) that I possibly could, prior to officially enrolling. I'm not entirely sure if things are the same with Sophia nowadays but when I did it, all of the courses/tests were unproctored and open-book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you do Sophia courses. I didn't do [SDC](https://study.com/) and personally I don't recommend it because their courses can take a while. [This resource](https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines) outlines what you can transfer in, for each WGU degree. I also transferred in the CompTIA A+, N+, S+ (these three certifications together are commonly referred to as the trifecta), because I already had them. WGU will pay for attempts for certifications if they are *required* for your degree program. I used to have a good transfer guide saved but I'm not sure what happened to it; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1390mx6/bsit_im_still_waiting_on_my_transfer_eval_of_my/) might be a helpful resource as well. Also, before you officially enroll, make sure to buy a webcam for the OAs. I use the Webcam 1000 which is what WGU recommends. It plugs into my laptop and works great. I've heard of other people buying one that has a tripod, so do some research and get whichever is best for you. Despite the scary proctoring stories you might read on this subreddit, I've never had any bad experiences myself. YMMV\\n\\nYou get assigned a Program Mentor before your start date. Mine has been extremely helpful and respectful of my preferred communication style and needs. I have seen reddit posts where people complain about their mentors- them wanting to schedule too many meetings, not opening classes, etc. This might be a good [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/16ybsoq/can_i_request_to_change_my_mentor_what_is_your/).\\n\\n**WGU**  \\nMy start date was October 1, 2023. I was able to complete 13 courses in my first term (a term is a 6 month period). I definitely recommend looking up the course code in this subreddit (ex: C268) to find resources. Here is some helpful information about the courses that stand out to me:\\n\\nC268 - This was the 4th class I had, and the real first challenge for me. I think it's like a meme in the WGU-IT community that we've all used [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pf6syi/c268_spreadsheets_video/) to help us pass. <15hrs of studying.\\n\\nC962 - This class was the most amount of writing I've had to do in my undergrad. You'll enjoy this class if you like reading, researching, and finding a great quote to support your writing. I think I wrote my paper about AI or wearable technology or something. This class was <25 hrs of work.\\n\\nC773 - I enjoyed this class a lot. This is an [exceptional resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1f12w4e/summary_user_interface_design_c773_passed_in_6/)\\n\\nD333 - I passed this exemplary on my first attempt but a lot of people have trouble with this class. I think that most of the names of the laws you have to memorize are self-explanatory. [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1d2f20e/d333_finished_in_3_days_passed_first_try_heres_how/)reddit post helped me formulate a strategy for studying for the exam, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/zhy5l8/d333_ethics_in_technology_updated_class_version/) post provides a lot of good learning material.\\n\\nThe CompTIA trifecta can be studied through [free courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/tcqdwh/guys_please_remember_that_wgu_gives_you_a_lot_of/) through udemy (all WGU students get a free udemy account). FWIW, I quit my security guard job around this time because I was offered an unpaid internship at my friend's dad's company. I'll talk more about this later.\\n\\nMy second term was from April 1 - Sept 30, and I was able to complete 3 courses (10 CUs):\\n\\nC954 - I spent a week straight in the library studying for this. Imo, this class is on par with the CompTIA A+ in terms of just how much course material there is. [This](https://onlinedegreeblog.com/wgu-c954-information-technology-management/) is a FANTASTIC read for those interested. Personally I loved this class because I felt like it tied everything together and gave me PRACTICAL insight into how companies (and specifically their IT department) function. If you're interested in additional learning opportunities beyond WGU, definitely look into Hubspot. It's a very popular CRM (well, it's more than just a CRM) that a lot of employers care about.\\n\\nC783 - I actually have weird circumstances regarding this class. I *forgot* to submit my CAPM certification prior to my start date. I reached out to my mentor and Student Support Services for help. My Mentor was able to fill out a form or something... and well, WGU made an exception for me. WGU makes it clear that they don't accept transfer credit after matriculation but they did for me, just this once. As a result, my program changed a little bit. I believe the BSIT is normally 122 credits but mine was changed to 138. Because I had passed the CAPM, the additional credits came from other courses, outside of my BSIT program, that were marked as Passed simply because me having the CAPM qualified me as having passed those courses. I never took the WGU OA for this class.\\n\\nI definitely slowed down in my 2nd/3rd terms and honestly I slacked off a lot. I was able to pull myself together and finish despite a lack of motivation. My third term was scheduled to end on the end of March (this month).\\n\\nC769 - My capstone project took me 2 weeks. Mine was about improving the security posture of a fictitious company. I really enjoyed working on this. If you're reading this and are about to start/currently working on your capstone, congrats on making it this far! I had a fun time using resources from my previous classes to work on this. I took this class more seriously than some of the others because I wanted my work to be a reflection of everything I've learnt at WGU.\\n\\nC777 - The dreaded Web Dev Applications. I took the Sophia course that is supposed to provide a foundation for this course so I didn't start with much knowledge. I procrastinated for weeks lol. PLEASE read the Study Guide. [This](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI) is a link to the study guide but I'm not sure if that link works, so please also refer to the 21day challenge document, sent in an email by your course instructor. I also watched the TraversyMedia HTML+CSS video a couple times and followed along with him. He will have you download SublimeTxt which is good, but I chose to use Visual Studio Code. The C777 study guide is your best friend. You're ready for the OA if you can score 90%+ on the practice OA, and if you feel comfortable creating a website. Another thing: some people may disagree with this, but for the purpose of passing your OA, try to not teach yourself additional information that isn't covered in the class. It can be a lot of information, try not to overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nD247 - I hated this class. This was my absolute worst class, and I just hated every second of it. My course instructor was amazing and I absolutely recommend that you review the powerpoints they've created- it's what helped me pass! The powerpoints will most likely be emailed to you. If not, please ask for them. One small mistake will flag your entire answer wrong for OA questions where you have to write code.\\n\\n**Graduation and my Personal Success Story**  \\nI applied for graduation on March 3rd and officially graduated on the 11th. I was emailed a link to download my WGU transcripts the next day, and was emailed a digital copy of my Diploma today (the 18th). I'm still waiting for my physical diploma and [regalia](https://www.buildagrad.com/wgu) to arrive. I'll be attending the Vegas commencement in April, hope to see you all there!!!! Maybe we can get a big groupchat together for people going! :)\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, I was offered an internship at my friend's dad's IT company. It was very informal and honestly a little disappointing but I was grateful for the opportunity to observe their work and go with them to meet with clients. I stayed with them for about 3 months or so and then decided to take a break to focus on my last two classes. Part of me regretted leaving my security job but I also didn't want to continue working there either. In the end, it worked out for me because I was able to put that \"internship\" on my resume and I figured that it looks better than no internship.\\n\\nI started to apply for jobs the moment I submitted my graduation application, which is what I recommend to everyone (if not sooner). However, it wasn't until after I graduated when I found the job posting for the job I got an offer for. I graduated on 3/11- on 3/12 I applied to this IT support technician job. I reached out to the recruiter (guide on that below) and we instantly connected. She helped me secure a screener interview (through Zoom) with the company later that week. I passed the screener interview and we set up an in-person interview yesterday. Honestly, I bombed the technical questions. I got destroyed in front of the CEO. I think I got the position because I spoke confidently and was transparent about my knowledge gaps. I arrived in a freshly dry-cleaned suit with 3 copies of my resume, and I took notes during the interview on my black leather padfolio (please buy one of these!). Every time they asked me a technical question I didn't know the answer to, I wrote it down, and said I'd research the answer. Also- before my interview- I wrote down questions I had for them, in my padfolio.\\n\\nThe job I was offered is a hybrid position and I couldn't be happier!!!! In 1.5 years I went from a security guard making 17/hr to making TC\\~60k in an MCOL, and I still live w my parents so no rent. Never, absolutely *never* doubt yourself.\\n\\nBelow are some tips I have for Resumes, Cover Letters, Applying, and Interviews. :)\\n\\n**Resume and Cover Letter Tips**  \\nYou already know that your resume (and cover letter) is extremely important, so I'm going to talk about how you can improve. Resume formats and the amount of creativity you can have really depends on the industry, so please don't interpret this as an end-all-be-all guide. This is more so for tech. Bluntly, you should have a pretty straightforward and easy-to-read resume.\\n\\n* Your resume should be 1 page unless you have 10-15+ years of experience. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jeg5ks/4_yoe_unemployed_tech_field_united_states/) is similar to what I use for mine (Idk why it's so zoomed in). Also please don't use a two-column layout.\\n* Your resume should be in an ATS-readable font such as Arial or Times New Roman (I use TNR for mine) and size 11 or 12.\\n* I suggest that you keep your resume in black and white. Don't use icons, shapes, or emojis. Far too often I see resumes with a little phone icon or something next to their phone number. These icons/shapes/emojis can look nice but they can also mess with the ATS (applicant tracking system) scanners, and also take the readers attention away from important details as they can be very eye-catching.\\n* Aim to fill the entire page. If you don't have enough experience or whatever that's completely fine, but there are ways to mitigate that. For instance you should use 12px size font, maybe expand upon your PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY section, make the size of your headings a little bigger, etc. You could also put a Relevant Coursework section in your Resume and name your WGU classes (don't include the course code \"C268\", just the name). This is what I did. During an interview, the hiring manager asked me about one of my classes!\\n* Your name/contact info section should contain your Firstname Lastname, phone number (xxx) xxx-xxxx, email (make sure your email sounds professional. Your professional email shouldn't be \"[gamerboy1206@gmail.com](mailto:gamerboy1206@gmail.com)\", it should be your name), a link to your Linkedin profile, and then city, State. Never put your exact address on your resume. That's a security concern and they don't need your address anyways, or at least until you get a job offer.\\n* Please, Please trim your Linkedin handle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNDY2KnXBw) for a guide on how to do that. Ensure your trimmed Linkedin handle is then put at the top of your resume\\n* If you have experience that isn't relevant to what you're applying for, put it on your resume anyways! Especially if you were there for a long time or if you really gained skills/experience.\\n* The bullet points under your jobs should NOT be pure fluff words. Instead, write meaningful statistics and hard facts.\\n   * \"Increased operational efficiency\" means nothing. Instead, you can put \"Achieved X through Y which resulted in Z\"\\n   * One of the bullet points in my resume is \"Efficiently handled over 100+ monthly calls, including inquiries, service calls, incident reports, technical support, and emergency responses.\" This bullet point includes an actual statistic, \"100+\", in a timeframe \"monthly\", and I specified the different types of regular issues I dealt with. Truthfully, I could have been more specific on \"technical support\", but I got the message across that I handled a variety of different inquiries. My intention there was to showcase my diverse skillset- again, there is always room to improve!\\n* WGU actually offers classes on Resume building, and will review your resume for free. You can find information to that [here](https://careers.wgu.edu/channels/resumes/). I did this, and the results were amazing! The more people you can get to look over your resume, the better.\\n* !! This one is very important. The end result of your resume should be a PDF. I've always used Google Docs online to create my resume. It allows me to convert it into a PDF with two clicks of my mouse. When you download your PDF, PLEASE rename it to \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_Resume\", instead of just \"Resume\". This will make it 1000x easier for hiring managers to see your resume and know it's from you. A lot of people name their resume just \"Resume\"... you need to stand out, and that's how you do it!\\n\\nIn addition to a resume, you should also make a cover letter template. Meaning, for every new cover letter you create, you change the name of the job title and company (written in the CL) to match the job you're applying for.\\n\\n* If you choose to make two templates, here is what I recommend you do: the first template should be called \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_CoverLetter\\_CompanyName\" and also \"FirstName.Lastname.CoverLetter.CompanyName\". That way, there is a slight difference between the two (that only you know of) and it still looks professional. For instance, lets say you want to apply to Helpdesk roles and Project Coordinator roles. The Helpdesk cover letter template could be the one with the periods, whereas the Project Coordinator cover letter templates could be the one with the underscores. Again, this is a very subtle way for you to distinguish between the two, so you can have a more personalized cover letter for the jobs you're applying to. This is actually what I do personally.\\n   * For example, my Project Coordinator cover letter is more geared towards PM/Project coordinator positions. It mentions my CAPM cert\\n* Your Cover letter should contain the same name and contact info as your resume. Same email, phone number, city, etc.\\n* Your CL (ideally) should be the same font and font size as your resume. I don't think this is necessarily required but the attention-to-detail can go a long way. I like the uniformity of doing it this way.\\n* As a general rule of thumb: the first paragraph (3-4 sentences) should explain who you are, the body paragraph should talk about your experiences, qualifications, why you want the position, and why you're a good fit, and the closing paragraph (2-3 sentences) should reaffirm your interest, express gratitude, and indicate your eagerness to discuss this opportunity/interview.\\n\\n**My 'Guide-to-Apply'**  \\nIt's vey rare that I'll hear back from an application submitted thru Indeed. LinkedIn is my preferred way to apply. I have LinkedIn premium (I highly suggest you try the $0 down *free trial*). I swear, it's what helped me get this job. If you get contacted about scheduling an interview, your next steps should be to research the company ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is an amazingggg tool for this).\\n\\n* Look up for tech job openings near you. Most of IT (and some CS) start out in job titles such as Helpdesk, Support I, jr IT specialist, IT technician, stuff of that nature. That's what you should be looking for. Don't expect to go right into cybersecurity lol. The reality is that cybersecurity is mid-level and senior-level.\\n* Have realistic salary expectations. A huge factor is where you live (understand the terms LCOL, MCOL, HCOL). But I think that a very general rule of thumb is that out of college you can reasonably expect between 40-65k for an entry level IT job, with the national avg being about 51k ish.\\n* GET A PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT TAKEN FOR YOUR LINKEDIN. Have your hair nice, shave your face or freshen up your facial hair, wear a fresh outfit, have a SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND, and just be presentable. You should want to look your best. [This is interesting:](https://www.earth.com/news/attractive-people-have-more-career-opportunities-and-success/)\\n   * DON'T put your headshot (or any pictures) on your resume. This might be a norm in other cultures but definitely not for tech jobs in the US\\n* Go on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and get a nice background for your linkedin. Doesn't have to have any text, could even just be a solid color with a gentle gradiant. Anything is (usually) better than the default background. Mine is just a blue background with some lines on it, it looks like waves. It's just an artistic thing. But I made sure that the tie I'm wearing in my profile picture is the same shade of blue as my background. I think it ties it together nicely.\\n* Reach out to a recruiter. I wouldn't have gotten this job opportunity without my recruiter's help. In my opinion, a good recruiter might feel like a 'temporary career coach'. My recruiter gave me advice, gave me constant updates, insight, etc. She was amazing. This is the message I sent her to initiate our first conversation:\\n   * Hi,  I hope you're doing well! I came across the *JobName* position at *CompanyName* and am very interested. I’d love to learn more about the key qualities and skills you’re looking for in applicants. Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to send my resume if that would be helpful.  Looking forward to your reply!  Best, *FullName*\\n* Monitor your email regularly. People don't like to be kept waiting, especially when companies may be interviewing potentially hundreds of other applicants.\\n\\n**Interviews**  \\nOne of the best resources for interviews (and resumes too) I've ever come across is chief.analyst on tiktok.  Even though he's in an entirely different industry (finance), I love his advice and how articulate he is. Being able to speak confidently and clearly is a non-negotiable. Never underestimate the importance of good communication- it's what helped me get this job after not being able to answer a single technical question correctly despite being up against over 160 other applicants.\\n\\nIt's typical for you to go through a virtual interview before being invited to an in-person interview. This is called a screener and as the name suggests, it's for screening out candidates who don't meet the qualifications necessary or those who appear to be unenthusiastic. Showing enthusiasm and positive energy is incredibly important- you can show this by asking questions, smiling, and knowing what the company does.\\n\\n* I mentioned this earlier in my Graduation section but invest in a padfolio. I think I got mine for $12 from Target. It should carry 3 copies of your resume (anything more is excessive) business cards if you have them (I personally did not), a pen (ensure that it works and isn't out of ink!), and paper for notes. You don't need your padfolio for a virtual interview- instead, I'd recommend you have your full attention on the interviewer. It helps to look directly at the camera (instead of your screen) so it gives the illusion you're looking directly at the interviewer, from their end.\\n* In my padfolio, I also wrote down questions I wanted to ask the interviewers, the night prior to the interview. Having pre-written questions made me look more prepared and took the burden off of me of having to remember them.\\n* Push in your chair after getting up, like when leaving your interview. Similarly- if they offer you water at the start of your interview, make sure you throw out the cup in a trashcan and don't leave litter in their office.\\n* Maintain eye contact and speak slowly. For me, it helps when I use my hands when I talk.\\n* Look, dress, and smell nice. You don't have to be a model but definitely make yourself look the best you possibly can. Also, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.\\n* I like watching CareerVidz on Youtube because he comes across as a little silly and that may (hopefully) take some pressure off of you. It's okay to be nervous, but try not to make it apparent.\\n* Rehearse your [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54).\\n* Research the company you're applying for, before any interviews. You can show a genuine interest in the company by understanding what they do and who they are.\\n* References: If you don't have any professional references, you can definitely ask a course instructor or your Program Mentor! They are here to support you and they will absolutely vouch for you (speaking from experience).\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI think it's incredibly important to continuously grow and improve regardless of which stage you're at- whether you're considering enrolling, have already enrolled, are about to graduate, or even if you're looking for a job. I'm hopeful that my write-up is able to offer a fresh perspective on the challenges and possibilities you might encounter. Sorry for any typos/weirdly worded sentences lol.\\n\\nI'm now looking forward to starting my MSITM on April 1 and starting my new job. If you have any tips/advice for the MSITM program, I'd love to get some info\\n\\nHope to see y'all at the Vegas commencement ceremony!!\\n\\nEDITS: Expanded upon my internship, additional random bullet points all throughout  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      D288 - Back-End Programming 2024 Guide!\\nHello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click > new > Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n>Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: <version>3.3.6</version>\\nLombok: <version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\\n<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>\\n<version>3.3.6</version>\\n```\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>\\n<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>\\n<version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n>MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n>When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet<>();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below. Other Reddit users and I will try and get to them and answer them accordingly. If a significant update/revision should be made to the guide, please leave a comment suggesting a change. I'll try and keep this guide relevant for at least a little while, but with the new degree plan coming, it will inevitably become superannuated.  \\n\\nIf you followed this guide and passed, **CONGRATS!** This is probably the most technical project I've done so far in my degree, and I had a lot of fun with it. So, I hope this guide made the class enjoyable for you too! Wishing you well in your future studies! 📚🎉  \n",







                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               BSSWE Java Track Monster Guide and Review\\nI finally graduated! After 3 terms, working full time at my job and as a father. I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database & SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching & promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope & out-of-scope), requirements (functional & non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development & testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.  \n",

experienced or heard how this course is low effort, half finished garbage. Well, since they can't be bothered to fix this course, it is up to us to help each other out. This post is my attempt to help fellow students with this project. After stumbling through this project for like a month and a half, I finally finished it and here is my best attempt at a guide.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly, get your IntelliJ Ultimate downloaded, and get your project files on your local machine. Check out my previous post at to get through task step A: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, so this project basically gives you a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and a myspace looking old school HTML user interface, and your job is to customize the code to meet a customers needs. You need to come up with a shop that will have 5 sample products, and 5 generic parts that can be combined to make those products. They give the example of a bicycle shop that has different bike types for products, like mountain bike/ road bike etc. and then generic parts for those such as seat, handlebars, gears etc. Do not overthink this, just choose something and keep it simple and generic.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo know what the heck is going on, here is some background info. To get something like this to work, it is convenient to use a framework, something to contain all your different files and get them to work together the way we want, while offering tools and libraries to simplify development and let us focus on the logic and features of the application we are creating. Often used with Spring is Spring boot, a sub project of Spring that simplifies things for us even more by using embedded web servers so you don't have to install and configure a separate web server, while also offering auto-configuration, so we have less to do manually to make sure that any files/classes etc that depend on other files/classes/methods etc have the information shared to be able to carry out their functions. This project uses a common design pattern known as MVC (model view controller). This is a way to organize an applications files based on its function which promotes organization, modularization, maintainability, reusability, testability, and improves development efficiency. Now if you have opened your project, it may seem overwhelming the amount of files in there, so I am going to try to tell you what files belong to what part of MVC, and a bit about what they do so you know what you are looking at.  \\n\\n\\n**Model:** represents the applications data and business logic. Encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the app, including data manipulation, validation, and interactions with the database. The files for this project relating to the model are:\\n\\n* Entities: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->domain you have 4 .java files containing entities. These are your classes, for the different types of parts, and for products. Entities are marked with the annotation '@Entity' which tells Spring this is an entity, allowing it to work its magic to make these work the way we want overall for the application.\\n* Repositories: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->repositories you have 4 repository .java files corresponding to the entity files. Repository files allow for CRUD (create read update delete) on the database. These files interact with the database and are marked with '@Repository'. Note that these files extend CrudRepository which eliminates the need for the annotation.\\n* Service: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->service, there are service files and service implementation files. The service files contain declarations but not the definitions, while the implementation files have the definitions to implement the service. Services interact with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.\\n* Validators: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->validators, contains .java files that contains the actual validation logic, and annotation files that allow you to make a custom annotation to easily mark your other files with ('@CustomAnnotation') to get the validation enforced. Code that enforces validation rules and constraints for your data.\\n\\n**View:** responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It encompasses the user interface elements, templates, and visual elements that users interact with. Views receive data from the Model and render it in a way that's suitable for presentation. Views also capture user input and pass it to the Controller for further processing. The files for the view layer are:\\n\\n* HTML Templates: src->main>resources->templates. These are all your html files that contain the format and structure for the webpages you see. This project uses Thymeleaf, a template engine that helps make dynamic html content.\\n* CSS: found in src->main->resources->static->css. This provides additional styling for the webpages to enhance the look and feel.\\n\\n**Controller:** These classes handle user requests, process input, interact with the Model, and determine which View should be rendered. Controllers are annotated with '@Controller'. In general, a controller in a Spring application is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate HTTP response. Controllers typically have methods annotated with '@RequestMapping'(or other annotations like '@GetMapping','@PostMapping', etc.) to define the URL paths they handle and the HTTP methods they respond to. The controllers are found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->controllers.\\n\\n**Other Notable Files:** There are some files that aren't included in MVC but are still important to recognize. These are:\\n\\n* BootStrapData.java: The purpose of this class is to provide initial data for testing and development, ensuring that there is data to work with when starting the application. This file is located at src->main->java->com.example.demo->bootstrap\\n* application.properties: a configuration file in a Spring Boot application that allows you to configure various settings and properties for your application. It is used to customize the behavior of your application without requiring changes to the source code. \\n* test files: located at src->test, contains files for testing your code.\\n* .gitignore: this file is used to specify files and directories that you want ignored by git when tracking changes in your project. I did not use this file at all for this project. Is found in target directory.\\n* mvn & mvnw: These are files used to ensure the right version of Maven is being used to build the project regardless of whether you have it installed or not. Maven is a build automation and project management tool that simplifies the process of managing and building software projects by providing a structured way to handle dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging.\\n* pom.xml: is the Project Object Model configuration file used by Maven to define project details, dependencies, and build settings for a Java project.\\n* README.md: is used to provide a brief and informative description of a project, often found at the root of a repository, to help users understand its purpose and usage. We will be using this file to track the changes we make for task steps C thru J.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, hopefully that helps, I was completely lost and overwhelmed at first but hopefully that gives you some background and helps you see how the pieces fit together. If it doesn't make sense yet, it will start to as you work through the project and see how things work together and interact. Anyway, on to the tasks!\\n\\n**NOTE:** to view and test your web app, open your browser and go to localhost:8080. This will show you your webpage in its current state. You must run the application successfully in IntelliJ for this to work. You will be using this a lot to make sure your changes are working the way you want and you are meeting the requirements.  \\n\\n\\n**Task B:** This part is super easy, they want you to create a README file, but there already is one! What I did here was I kept the nice WGU and D287 header stuff deleted the rest, and then I copy and pasted the task requirements from parts C to J so I could type my changes for each part under the step it is a part of.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**NOTE:**  For tasks C - J you have to commit and push with a message to the remote repository after the completion of each step. You are allowed to push more often, but at a minimum you must push after each step is completed and put a brief meaningful message. At the end you will have to get the history and submit it with your zip file. I made a new branch to do all my changes to, and named it working\\_brach, as this is more common than doing work on the main branch. To make a new branch, go to the bottom right of the screen, click the current branch, and it will bring up some options. Click new branch, name it something like working\\_branch, and check the box for checkout branch so that you make it the branch you are working on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task C:** For this step, you will be working in mainscreen.html. You will need to customize this page to reflect your custom shop choice, changing the titles and headers appropriately. Make sure to log the changes and locations on the README. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message. You can do this by clicking the git tab and then clicking commit, and it should bring up a commit window where your project window usually is, and then you can select what changes to commit, type your message, and select commit & push. Almost every time I did this, I got warnings and it stopped the push, and I had to click push anyway. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task D:** For this part you need to understand some basic html. This step you need to make an about page, and so you will need firstly a template, so create a new html template with all your other templates (when asked if you want to add your new file to git, always say yes). This file will be where you create all the visuals for your about page, where you describe briefly your business and who its for. I just put some super generic stuff about how we care about the customer and giving back etc. I copy and pasted the first 12 or so lines from another html template just so it had the same styling and structure info as the other webpages. I personally tried to match the look of mainscreen.html, but you can make it however you want. Remember to catalogue each change you make in the README.md file. For example, if you add a title for your about page, you would put something like: -about.html: added title 'About' on line 15. You need to say what file, have it under the correct task letter, and say what line(s) the change(s) is(are) on and what the change(s) is(are). When you are satisfied with your about.html, you will need to make a controller for it in the directory with all the other controllers. The controller is being used to map the URL to  the corresponding webpage and guiding Spring on which template to utilize for rendering the content. Remember to annotate your controller with '@Controller' just like in the other controller classes, and you will also need the @GetMapping(\"name\\_of\\_about\\_template\\_here\") in your class definition to connect the template and the url such that you can reach this page and see it by going to localhost:8080/about\\_template\\_name\\_here. Check out the other controller classes to get an idea how for this, or watch a video on it if needed. On mainscreen.html, you will need to add a button that takes you to the about page you created, I just copy and pasted similar code for other buttons and changed the link for it and name to make this work. Similarly, on your about html file you will want to add a link or a button back to the mainscreen. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **Task E:** Now you need to add a sample inventory consisting of 5 products and 5 parts. There is commented out code in the BootStrapData.java file that gives you an example of how to create a part and a product (in separate spots), you can use that and change it to make 5 of each. You either need to add an if statement that checks if the parts count and products count is zero before adding the sample inventory, or you will need to comment your code out after the sample is added to your page so you don't keep adding duplicates. If you don't add the logic to check for this, make sure to make a note somewhere to uncomment this code back out before you submit your project, or it will get sent back as they will not see your sample database get loaded in. (Hint: I used variables for part count and product count and set them equal to their respective repository classes and used the .count() method to see if both were == 0 before adding the sample inventory). Once you are done, commit and push with a message. Make sure you are logging all your changes!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task F:** This step asks you to add a Buy Now button next to the update and delete buttons for your products. The button needs to decrease the inventory of the purchased product by one, and make no changes to the inventory of parts. You need to display a message for failure or success of a purchase. First I would add the button to mainscreen.html in the appropriate spot. There is a table in mainscreen.html that sets up the products table, you will see it referencing tempProduct.name, .price, .inv, and then you will see the update and delete buttons. You will want to add your Buy Now button in here. The button here is a bit tricky as you need it to map to /buyProduct URL (we will make the controller for this later) and you need to set it up for http POST request so it can access and update the inventory amount for purchased products. You also need to pass a hidden input field so that you can pass the tempProduct.id along to the controller. I would post the code for this but I don't want this post to get taken down lol. Next you need to make a new controller to handle the desired behavior of the buy now button. Once you make your controller, make sure to annotate it as a controller. For this controller I added a private ProductRepository object with an '@Autowired' annotation, as the ProductRepository provides methods for interacting with the database which we need to do to decrement the inventory by 1 after purchase, and the annotation injects an instance of ProductRepository into this controller, which allows it to use the methods it needs. Just like the other controllers, we are going to make a public String method, I called it buyProduct. For its input parameters, you need to use the '@RequestParam' annotation to be able to obtain the productID from the product that was purchased over on mainscreen. Next I created an Optional <Product> object that assigns its value to the .findById method of the product repository, using the productID obtained from '@RequestParam'. By using Optional<Product>, the code handles the possibility that the requested product might not exist in the database. It avoids directly returning null when the product is not found, which helps improve code readability and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. This object basically represents whether the product was found in the database or not. Using that, you can set up if statements based on whether that object.isPresent() is true or not, and if it is true, you can create a Product object and set it equal to the optional object.get(). You can then set up an additional if statement that checks if that products inventory (product.getInv) is above 0, if it is then you can set the inventory for it to its current value -1 (decrement the inventory like the instructions wanted). Make sure to save this new value using the product repository .save() method to save the new count to the repository. If this part of the code is reached, then the product had enough in stock to be purchased, its inventory was subtracted by one to reflect a purchase, and now you can generate a success message. There are many ways to do this (as is the case with most of the project), but I personally made a new html template both for a purchase success and a purchase error. You can use a redirect statement in your return statement to the url of your success page for the case that the purchase went through, or to your error page if it did not. You will need to add '@GetMapping' annotations and displayPurchaseSuccess (or error) methods that return to the appropriate url. After the controller is all setup, you make your html templates for the success and error pages if thats the way you chose to do. These can be super simple, basically mine just said purchase successful or purchase error in big letters when the page loaded. When everything is working and looking the way you want, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task G:** In this step you have to add max and min inventory fields for parts, modify your sample inventory to show the max and min inventory, and update both the part forms to have additional inputs for the max and min inventory. Then they want you to rename the database file, and add code that enforces that the inventory is between the max and min values. First go to Part.java, and add the minInv and maxInv fields (name em whatever you want), you can also use the same '@Min' annotation as the other fields to enforce that it cannot be below zero, and have a message with it. Be sure to also add a new constructor that includes these new fields, and make getter and setter functions for them. Next go back to BootStrapData.java and add max and min inventory values for your sample inventory parts. Then for both InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm, add text inputs for both max and min inventory. You can probably figure out how to put it in there just by seeing how the other fields are put in there and copying it but changing as necessary. Then rename the database file, it will look something like this **spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db** you can find it in file explorer or finder and right click it and rename it to whatever you like. In the application.properties file, you will need to rename it there as well and make sure they match. Next I would create a method in Part.java that checks if an inventory is valid, by returning true if the inventory falls between the max and min values, and returns false otherwise. For both inhouse and outsourced part controller files, add logic that uses the isInvValid method you created to generate an error message if the inventory is outside of range. I used BindingResult to reject bad values with a message, look into this for the error messaging. Once this is working as expected and desired, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task H:** This step wants you to add additional error messages and more specific error messages, one for if the inventory is below the minimum, one for if the inventory is above the maximum, and one for if adding/updating a product would cause an associated part to fall below the minimum. This isn't too bad, adding some more if else type logic to both inhouse and outsourced part controllers will take care of the first two conditions I listed. For the last requirement, I edited EnufPartsValidator.java with some additional requirements in the if statement that returns false to check if any of the parts for the product would fall below their minimum if the product was made (Hint: p.getInv() - 1 < p.getMinInv()). I also updated the error message from ValidEnufParts to be more specific. When you are happy with the results and everything has been tested and working, commit with a message and push. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task I:** Add two unit tests to the PartTest class for the maximum and minimum inventory fields. The course resources has a video for this. You go to the file, and use the '@Test' annotation, and then make two tests that look similar to the tests already in this file. For min, you can set the minimumInv to a number that you expect to be the lowest to be used for the program, its just an arbitrary test number. Then you use partIn and set its value to the variable you just assigned, and use assertEquals() to make sure that it works as expected. Repeat for partOut. Do all this again but for maximumInv. Thats it for this one. When it is working, commit and push with message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task J:** Remove the class files for any unused validators. This one was so simple it had me doubting myself. When you open the validators, it will tell you how many usages intellij recognized for them. One of them had no usages so I deleted that one. It was really that simple lol. Commit and push with a message. This is the last step that needs to be tracked in the read me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow double check you meet all the rubric requirements, watch the completed project video from the course resources and make sure you got all the right stuff, and when you are satisfied and everything is working, export your project to a ZIP. Next on Gitlab, go to the code tab on the left hand side, expand it with a click and then select repository graph. This shows your commit and push history and must be turned in. Use print button and then specify print to PDF, and save it to your computer. You must turn this in with your project ZIP. Finally, get the url for your gitlab by clicking the blue clone button and copying the https url. When you submit, you need the ZIP, the repository graph, and the URL. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI hope this guide helps, please let me know of any mistakes or typos, I wanted to do this quickly and move on to my next course. If you have questions feel free to ask, but just know I stumbled my way through this and by no means to I understand everything or am an expert. This guide does not constitute the right way, best way, only way, or most efficient way to do this project. It is just what worked for me. I tried to tell you as much as possible without just giving things away and getting in trouble lol.  When you guys finish this course, make sure to let them know honestly how you feel about the course in the end of course survey! Best of luck. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;  \n",



Adventure\\nJuly seems to be a good month for me. July 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from WGU in Business Management. After that was done, I wrote this post, to give my take on the \"Sort of\" acceleration I did through my undergrad studies. It's a long read...but...if you want context for this post...feel free to give it a skim: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu\\_bs\\_in\\_business\\_management\\_the\\_sortof/geijacp/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu_bs_in_business_management_the_sortof/geijacp/?context=3)\\n\\nFast forward to July 2021...and I just completed my MBA at WGU as well. Like I said...July seems to be my jam. My first Graduate Term at WGU started in October 2020, so I accelerated two years of course work, into a little less than 10 months. Not too shabby. \\n\\nNow, you've likely seen other posts. \"I accelerated my Bachelors degree (or MBA) in 2 weeks\" or something of the like. My point here, is the same as it was last time: I'm not racing anyone. I applaud those who were able to do in minutes what took me months. However, for those who are still with me here...keep in mind I work full time in the Tech sector as a Senior Program Manager, I coach high school athletics on the side, and I have a family that I happen to enjoy spending time with. That's why I title my posts as a \"sort of\" acceleration. I don't have every hour of my day to devote to classwork so I can hammer out 11 classes in 11 days; but I want to give back to the WGU subreddit, because I got a lot of assists from these posts and I want to help others, who may only be looking for a kick in the arse that they can do it too. I did what I could in the evenings to devote to my school work, and on weekends too. But, I really didn't sacrifice an entire weekend to school at any point. I enjoy sipping my coffee. I also just happened to have an Appendicitis during my MBA Adventure, so that didn't exactly help my cause! \\n\\nI gave a lot of advice and pro-tips in my Bachelor's Degree post above. But, I'll reiterate the important ones here, up front:   \\n\\n\\n**1)** Get a Business Calculator, (I bought the BA II Plus) and learn it. *Know thy calculator*. It will save you a LOT of time. \"But, hey OP. I have a graphing calculator. I'm good.\" Sure, but, you could be better off. The Business Calculator, when you get into the Financing Courses will legit save you a ton of time. \\n\\n**2)** Be nice to your exam proctors. They work in a call center for God knows how many hours a day, watching people take exams. Sometimes they'll ask you to do something that no other proctor asks you to do. Just, go with it. Sometimes I was asked to take off my Smart Watch, sometimes, I wasn't. Sometimes I was asked to take my hand away from my face during exams (I tend to rest my chin on my hands during exams); other times, I wasn't asked to do that. Sometimes I quietly talk through an exam question to myself, and sometimes the proctor would chime in and ask me if I was talking to someone in the room, and I'd have to rotate the camera to show I was alone; and sometimes it didn't matter at all. But, there's no need to make your proctored exams more stressful then they may already be. Just go with the flow. They're human, just like you and I are, and there isn't a single proctor out there like \"I'm totally going to try and get this person to fail their exam\". Be kind. \\n\\n**3)** Be patient when you submit papers for grading. They have three days to return it to you. *Pro-Tip*: if you can avoid it, try to get your papers submitted before the end of the month. There is legitimately a term ending at the end of every month; so the volume increases a lot at the end of the month. I generally found papers I'd turn in, in the middle of the month would get graded in 12-36 hours; whereas at the end of the month, you can bank on it taking all three days. For whatever it's worth to you. \\n\\n**4)** Regarding papers: I said it before, I will repeat myself: Follow. The. Rubric. Every. Single. Word. Of. It. If you deviate from the Rubric, it doesn't matter how much you write, or how eloquent you are, or what your experience is in professional writing in your career. You will get your paper returned. You could write War and Peace, and get your paper returned. Or, you could follow the Rubric, write two pages, and pass. Just give them what they ask for, because that's what they're looking for to grade.\\n\\n**5)** It's okay to fall behind a bit, or to stall out a bit. My term started in October 2020. I didn't even get to open the first course until November, because of a work deadline. You can catch up. In the MBA program, you have six months to complete three classes. Anything else, is gravy. \\n\\n**6)** Take the Pre-Assessment straight-away when starting a class with a proctored exam. Have no fear. There is no penalty for getting crushed on the Pre-Assessment, and there's no limit to the number of times you can take it. But, you want the Assessment Report at the end of it. It will not only tell you the weight of each section to better help you study, but will also give you an answer key to see what you missed. As a bonus, if you pass it, it unlocks your Proctored Exam (Objective Assessment/OA) right away, so you can schedule it. I took the Pre-Assessment straight-away for every class I had with an exam, and it helped me shore up where I was weak, and I saved time by not studying sections I aced. \\n\\n**7)** Get a Quizlet account. You're welcome.\\n\\nHere we go:   \\n\\n\\nThere are eleven courses to complete for your MBA. Six of them have a Proctored Exam, five are written papers. The Data Driven Decision Making course (C207) has both Proctored Exam, and two papers to write. I'm going through them, in the order I took them, over the course of ten months (one, six-month term, and then three and a half months of a second term). I took some cues from a post by [https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) and his Mega Thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/). I always like to give credit where it's due. They had a bit of a different journey than I did, but we also had some similarities. But, I did draw some inspiration from their post, which is why it looks similar! \\n\\n**Managing Organizations and Leading People (C200)** *– Two Papers*   \\nThey ease you in with a pretty easy class up front. First up, get the Signature Themes Assessment out of the way. I think it took me about a half hour ish. Download the result, and start in on your papers. I wrote both papers over the course of two days. Paper 1 wants you to talk about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Paper 2 is for you to use a situation with a real organization, but you have to redact the info, and make up fake names. Then you write about a leader you know in the org. No reinvention of the wheel here. \\n\\n**Managing Human Capital (C202)** *– One Proctored Exam (OA)*   \\nThis class was super chill. Honestly, anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content here as common workplace knowledge. Not necessarily every word, but you know what I mean. I took the pre-assessment straight-away without looking at a single word of the course, passed it, and then scheduled my OA for that weekend to give me a couple days to study where I was weak. Took my OA a couple days later, and passed. \\n\\n**Management Communication (C204)** *– One Paper, One PowerPoint & Video + One Executive Summary*   \\nPaper 1 involves writing up a few emails and letters to your staff, your industry contact and your shareholders of your company that distributes a hot and fancy new product, depending on your chosen scenario. you pick. This is a class to have fun with. Level of Difficulty is not high at all. After Paper 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow. The. Rubric. Then you make a Panopto video. It's very easy. You download and install the Panopto (or use the web version). When it opens, add your PowerPoint you created, and start recording your presentation. My video was about 8 1/2 minutes, and I passed on the first attempt. Then write your Executive Summary of your PPTX and submit the lot. This all took me about a work week in the evenings, but if you had a weekend you could probably hammer it out in a full day, maybe two.\\n\\n**Marketing (C212)** *– One Paper*   \\nI've seen other posts calling this paper a monster. I respectfully disagree. Mine was ten pages, including the title page, table of contents and references. So, my actual content was seven pages long. Just follow the Rubric. I've seen other posts where they wrote 16+ pages. They must reeeeeeeeeally love writing more than I do. I don't add a lot of fluff. Just write what they ask for. You are tasked with writing a proposal for a hot new product from any of seven provided industries. (I work in the Technology sector, so I chose Technology.) This took me about a week, but I started this class the day after Thanksgiving. So, between Turkey Coma and Black Friday (which, let's be honest...due to COVID-19, there wasn't really a Black Friday, as much as there was me not wanting to look at school while I made leftover stuffing...and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...)\\n\\nI'm grouping the next two together. C213 and C214. Here comes that need for the Business Calculator. Friendly Reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Let it do the work for you. My best advice is this: Do whatever you must with your Program Mentor to get them to schedule these two back-to-back. Bribe them, beg them, or simply ask them. Taking C214 immediately after C213 is a game changer, as they tie into one another like Cookies and Cream. I asked my mentor about it; he sort of waffled; so I asked again, and he adjusted my Degree Plan so I could take them back-to-back. \\n\\n**Accounting for Decision Makers (C213)** *– One OA*  \\nThere are some calculations and math, but not too terribly much. I've seen other posts that say \"don't worry about the math, just focus on all the other class material and you'll be good\". False. Disagree. Nope. Spend time on the math. There's enough math on the exam that if you bomb the math, you're going to essentially need to be perfect on the rest of the exam to pass. I have a strategy on any sort of Finance, Statistics, or Math exams that include theory questions as well. I do the non-math related questions first. If I get to a question that includes an equation, I skip it, and come back to it. Save all the math to last, that way once I switch my brain to calculations, I don't have to switch it back. For me, that's helps bring down the stress level. (Having a beer with me during the exam also helps. Just saying.) I used the same strategy for Financial Management. This one took me four days, because I had a weekend in there that I could devote 2-3 hours at a time to, here and there. Otherwise, probably would have taken a week or so, with after work studying.\\n\\n**Financial Management (C214)** – *One OA*   \\nAnother reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Especially if you've never used a financial calculator before. All the formulas you need will be given to you on the Pre-Assessment and the OA, you don’t have to remember any of them. You'll find many things from C213 carry over here, so that's nice...and the reason I say do whatever you can to take this immediately after C213. Memorize the Financial Concepts as best you can. The math won’t be crazy tough, especially if you *Know thy calculator*. There are more non-math questions than there are finance math questions, but don't skimp on learning the math. Last thing you want is to start second guessing your non-math question answers, because you're not feeling too confident about the Finance Math questions. This one took me two weeks, an hour here and an hour there. \\n\\n**Ethical Leadership (C206)** – *Three Papers*   \\nI admit it. Writing papers bores me to death. With an exam, I can get in, hammer it out, and be done. Not so much with papers. But, c'est la vie. Another easy one, just a time suck because of having to write not one, not two, but ***three*** papers. Blah. First up, do the “Ethical Lens Inventory” task in the course itself. Pretty sure this took me a half hour or so. For Paper 1, write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. I used someone I used to work for. But, I've seen other posts that they wrote about Lincoln, etc. Write about different leadership concepts. For Paper 2, write about social responsibility and leadership. For Paper 3, write about the code of ethics and its various leadership applications. All three papers, including citations, was a total of 21 pages of writing. Took me two weeks, but in fairness, I was doing this right before Christmas, and decorating the tree, watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and wrapping presents took priority. I'm not sorry. :-)\\n\\n**Data-Driven Decision Making (C207)** – *Two Papers and One OA*   \\nI've read other posts basically calling this class The Devil. Like, bust out the Exorcism for this class, and burn it at the stake for heresy. Honestly, I didn't think it was all that horrible. But, I enjoy data, so to each their own. It took me three weeks. First, form a hypothesis, then you complete Paper 1, which is a form they provide, and turn it in. Then, the data fun starts. Follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis option from the list. I will say this, don't overly complicate things, regardless of how much you like data. Use the T-Test. It's the simplest one, requiring the least amount of data, and therefore has the least friction. You could choose others, but that's like deciding to run a full marathon when you registered for a half-marathon. Not like you're going to get two medals for finishing. Anyways, plot the numbers in Excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for 30 data points. (*Pro-Tip*: Make sure you have the add-on installed in Excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions if you don't). You have to write Paper 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. I was able to get data from my wife's place of work, so this probably made things easier for me too. After Paper 2 passes, then it's time for the OA. Remember when I said \"Get a Quizlet account\" up above? You should use it here. If you're not a data person, take your time. Data isn't an easy topic for many people, so put on your Patience Hat, and grab a beer while you study. \\n\\n**Operations Management (C215)** – *One OA*   \\nSo, I've spent some of my career in Ops Management, so I breezed through this one. I wish I had some pearls of wisdom to share here. I was done in four days, and that's only because the closest OA I could schedule when I wasn't at work...or at near midnight was four days after I took the Pre-Assessment. Topics included supply/demand, operations and employee functions, and process improvement. But again, I've worked in this field, and when I passed the Pre-Assessment with Exemplary across the board, I didn't even bother to crack the study material. So, you may want to search for another sub-Reddit thread that goes into detail here.  \\n\\n**Global Economics for Managers (C211)** – *One OA*   \\nIf you pay even a small bit of attention to business environments, the economy, currency exchange, global corporation behavior, this won’t be a headache. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge on my part. I took the pre-assessment right away as per usual, then scheduled the OA for later that week. Took about 6 days from start to finish. But, this was my last OA, and a cause for celebration! \\n\\n**MBA Capstone (C216)** – *One Business Simulation + Three Papers*   \\nPaper 1 is a PowerPoint presentation + Panopto video (Exactly like C204 above). Task 2 is a pretty lengthy paper as a Stockholder Report (mine was 19 pages); Paper 3 is basically submitting your resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and a tiny paper on what you learned during the MBA that helped you on the Capstone Simulation (mine was 5 total pages, including the cover page and Table of Contents). \\n\\nOf all the courses I have taken with WGU, including my Undergraduate course load, this was by far my most favorite. An actual workplace simulation of opening your own small business. There is a lot of work to do for this course, as there should be for a culminating final of a graduate level degree program. All up, I spent close to three weeks on this sucker. I could have done it faster, but I wanted my presentations to be air tight. Also...above I mentioned an Appendicitis. Well, this is when it hit, was during my Capstone. So, take that into consideration as well. Start off with the simulation. The simulation consists of a start-up business and it's first six quarters of operation that you have to get through. After you get to the end of Q4, you have to stop and that is the information you use for Paper 1 (the PPTX presentation/video) to justify your decisions you've made up to that point.  You actually cannot progress to Q5 and Q6 in the simulation until you pass Paper 1. Don't forget: Follow. The. Rubric. To. The. Letter. This is basically a sales pitch to potential investors in your business. Also, this is where you have to be in professional dress for the camera, so ditch the hoodie and put on a collared shirt. *Pro-Tip 1*: Submit Paper 1, then submit Q4 in the Simulation, in that order. Don't submit your Q4 decisions before turning in the Paper. *Pro-Tip 2*: Do the \"Final Check\" each quarter before you submit your results. Don't deviate from that. You can really screw yourself if you muck something up and submit it. The Final Check looks for errors. Once you pass Paper 1, you'll be able to move on to Q5 and Q6. \\n\\nNext, you'll complete the final two quarters, then comes Paper 2, the Stockholder Report. To beat the long dead horse, Follow. The. Rubric. This isn't going to be a short paper, so buckle up, and knuckle down. This paper is written as a narrative, so don't use the Bullet Points from the Task 2 explanations. You don't want it written as a Book Report; you want to tell the graders a story about why you did what you did, and when you did it, and why you did it.  You'll download reports from the simulation, and take screenshots, and have appendices. But, you can do it, because you're storytelling. Since you made the decisions along the way, you know why you did what you did. You just have to explain it, like you're telling a story about it. I found it to be very fun, and I learned quite a bit by doing it. Again, easily my most favorite class I took at WGU. Once this one is submitted, you're basically in the clear. All the grinding work is done, and Paper 3 awaits...and...they sure do lob you a softball on this one to swing at.\\n\\nPaper 3 is writing a quick explanation of of three competencies you used throughout the MBA program that helped you successfully complete the simulation. You'll then create a SMART goal about your career. Then you discuss and attach three artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification or other that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future. (I used my undergrad degree, and two professional certifications I have - my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and my PMP Certification as my three.) Then update your resume (make sure WGU is listed as the latest school with the expected degree end month and year). Then, print off your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or create a profile if you don't have one). But...don't trip at the finish line! **Follow. The. Rubric.** You don't want the final thing you have to do to be having to re-do a cupcake Paper because you hit Auto-Pilot. Submit the lot. Once you punch submit that last time, sit back and remember Advice Point 3 from above, about being patient while they grade papers. Head to the pub, and drink a well earned beer. Maybe add some Chili-Cheese Fries, for posterity. Just sit and wait to see the good news email hit your Inbox with that glorious subject line \"**You Passed!**\" You did it!!! You made a choice to get your MBA...and now...it's yours! Your program mentor will call or email you very soon. They'll gush about how awesome you did. You'll get an email from Records, that your Mentor submitted you for graduation. Fill that application out when the email comes through. It'll take a couple days to process your degree; and within a couple weeks, you'll get a digital degree you can use online, and shortly thereafter, a package from your Mail Carrier with a super rad piece of paper within, declaring that WGU certifies you to be a master of all things business administration related!\\n\\nCongratulations to you, you're now the proud owner of a Graduate Degree. Now, when you see career opportunities that say \"MBA Required\"; you get to smile; and that's a pretty rad feeling. \\n\\nAnd to you...yes you...reading this wondering if you should enroll. You have obligations. You don't know if you can carve out the time. You work yourself to the bone, and barely have time to sleep. You can do it. I legit work 50+ hour weeks, then I go coach high school sports, then I like to have free time and spend it with my family. Oh...one other thing...I also run marathons competitively. Do you know how long a 23 mile training run takes on a Sunday morning? You don't want to know. But, I made a decision. I knew I could sacrifice some time to open doors that were closed to me previously. Because, it doesn't take forever to get that MBA. It only takes a little time, right now. The longer you delay, the longer it will be before you finish. \\n\\nYou can do it. You can. You just have to make the choice. I don't know you. I will never meet you. I don't know your story, or how you got to where you are right now that lead you to this post. But...I believe in you. But, me believing in you isn't good enough. YOU have to believe in you too. So, stop reading this, and get cracking on that MBA. It's already printed off. It just needs to know your name so it can find it's way to your mailbox and live out it's days, decorating your wall in a diploma frame. :-)\\n\\nGood luck!  \n",



classes)\\nThis is a guide to how I did my **MBA** at WGU (in **19 Days)**\\n\\n**I  moved my post over from the other subreddit, as I wanted to  specifically help people who are looking for information related to the  Business degree, specifically, the MBA.**\\n\\nThis  is a full, per course, write up of how I experienced each course, and  what I did to pass. This is only to let people know how “I” did it.  Please don’t take this as a “be all end all”. I take no responsibility  for your progress, and everyone has to put in their work. I would love  to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any  kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it. You can  do it, but remember that everyone is different.\\n\\nI  will however, link you to a blank APA template I used for all my  papers. It is formatted with headers and everything, with a brief  explanation of the sections. I used this template for all my papers.

If  you are planning to start soon and wanna break my record, Go for it!  Also, if you are already started, but wanna try to accelerate, hopefully  a little from this write-up can help you too! The goal is to finish,  even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast!  I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however,  anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I  personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before  I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back  a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use  this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes  relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore  we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s  coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will  suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting  your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*,  that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est  this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est  re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not  pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*.  If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of  thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass  before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*,  and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2  days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est  thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then  add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try. Go here:  [**https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl**](https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl)\\n\\nC204 – Management Communication – **Very Easy Class. 1 Paper, 1 PowerPoint Presentation and Video + 1 Executive Summary**.  This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job  well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qc5bhx6kre051.jpg?width=653&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=18e976844dd1590b122f3580644ec34cbf84c5d8)  "

       "      <td>So what's the story on C192 Data Management for Programmers replacing C993 Structured Query Language?\\nI've read in a couple of different places that C192 is a class you can switch into instead of C993. And maybe it's replacing C993 in the future? It seems like people are already switching into it from some other posts.\\n\\nAlso, I've read a lot of negative things about C192, but the Oracle test for C993 is also said to be extremely tough. I am someone who has been using Microsoft SQL Server for 20 years (and its precursor Sybase SQL before that), mostly in a programmer role but also a bit of DBA.\\n\\nI emailed my mentor so I'm mostly just impatient to hear an answer. Plus I figure it might be helpful to elevate it so other people who are in the dark like me will be aware. And I'd love to hear any firsthand info anyone has (especially those in or finished with the course since they brought it back).\\n\\nUpdate: My mentor managed to get me switched over. There was a slight hitch in that I'd already enrolled in the class. So if you want to switch, don't do that. But they managed to switch me anyway. It sounds like it's still not a regular thing they'll do, but keep it mainly for people who are failing the C993 cert test over and over and are coming up on graduation/term deadlines (or just running out of retries). My term ends in April and with this and the capstone and C777 (the easiest of the lot, especially now that CIW is gone), it was getting a little more hairy.\\n\\nI was happy to see C192 is an in-house exam with 150 minutes to do 56 questions with a cut score of 72%. One of my main fears about the Oracle test was that it was 120 minutes for 78 questions. Granted, the cut score for it would be lower - 63% - but I was really worried about the time. The pre-assessment for C993 was the first one where I ever even came *close* to running out of time. I ran out of time with a few questions skipped and definitely some hurried through, getting a 68% score. We'll see how this compares with the C192 test. But I sure found out that it's very hard for me to read unformatted SQL in a proportional font.\\n\\nI am in BSSD. I don't know how this might apply to some other majors. My degree had 122 CUs, so switching the 4 CU C993 to 3 CU C192 meant I still had 121 CUs. I think I've heard that 120 CUs is the minimum for a BS. Maybe in other degrees, dropping the hour would put you at 119 CUs?\\n\\nHope this helps.</td>\n",

(+tips)\\nProof:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n73vpnsihyy91.png?width=845&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86d856dbf3d8af0886c9901410af8cf4f7621e59\\n\\nFor some background: I earned my bachelors at WGU. I have no background in economics, I've also never had an economics class. I have some experience with global trade concepts through prior classes.\\n\\nThis class was weird because it first appears deceptively easy. I watched some of the recorded cohorts and found the concepts simple, but knew the class was well-known as being difficult so I must be missing something. I took the PA and bombed it miserably. BUT! you can't know what you don't know until you're faced with not knowing it- so the PA helped pin that down, especially since there were several questions I couldn't even 'process-of-elimination' my way to a right answer.\\n\\nHere's what helped me the most (after the PA):\\n\\n* Dr. Wades cohort recordings. You can find these in the course search. They give a good overview of the topics but don't go too in-depth.\\n* ACDC Econ on youtube. Jacob Clifford broke down all of the economic concepts beautifully and does a great job of showing the relationships between them while still being entertaining. I watched many of his macroeconomics and microeconomic videos.\\n* Crashcourse Economics on youtube, also starring Jacob      Clifford. The last few videos are the most helpful, but I recommend watching most of the videos in the playlist because they are short and add a lot of context to the material.\\n* Khan academy on youtube. I searched anything I still didn’t feel confident in after crashcourse and ACDC Econ. Their videos, while rather dry, were very helpful.\\n* After taking the PA, I filled out gaps in my notes by going through each question and writing down the terms and concepts that I didn’t know or wasn’t sure about, including the wrong answers.\\n* After taking the PA you can access some practice tests in the textbook. Look in the course chatter for the password to access them. Many of the questions asked on the practice tests were similar to the      OA. If you can get high scores on all the post-PA practice tests you can pass the OA. Study extra on any of these tests you score low on. I took notes on these the same way I did with the PA and used those notes to study.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat didn’t help and why:\\n\\n* Quizlet. I’m usually a real quizlet stan but in this class its not very helpful. Of course the terms and definitions are important – but the relationships between concepts are more important for this course.\\n* The provided study guide. Its overwhelming to fill out and has things you don’t need while missing things you do.\\n* The textbook reading. The quizzes were helpful, but the actual reading material was a slog. I browsed through it at first because I did attempt to fill out the study guide, but quickly found I'm not about that life.\\n* Other recorded cohorts in the course. Theres like nine of them, they are probably informative but I found them boring and hard to sit through.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThings to understand (AKA concepts I remember the OA touching on a LOT but not exact questions so hopefully this is allowed)\\n\\n* Currency exchange – understand transactions, what happens if currency value rises or falls, what causes value fluctuations? How does it affect the government and consumers of a country. How do firms mitigate risk when it comes to currency exchange.  Not all currency questions specifically mention the word currency so look for rate/exchange/monetary and other related terms.\\n* Market/command/mixed economy and theocratic/civil/common law implications\\n* Monetary policies – understand what happens when the fed changes reserve requirements, interest rates, income taxes. How do tariffs impact domestic consumers, the domestic government, the foreign business. Same with quotas.\\n* Foreign direct investment (FDI) – how does it impact domestic and global firms/public/govt/trade. Equity vs non-equity investment, what those are called, and the pros/cons of each.\\n* What counts as GDP, what is considered an investment under GDP. Difference between GDP and GNP.\\n* Price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, cross-price elasticity. What makes a product demand elastic vs inelastic? Substitution vs complementary products **KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ON A GRAPH**\\n* **KNOW MONOPOLY/OLIGOPOLY/MONOPOLISTIC/PERFECT COMPETITION** – Which ones make economic profit in longrun/shortrun, shape of their demand curve, their elasticity, price makers/takers (why), examples of their products, barriers to entry. How are they similar, how are they different? How are they affected by change.\\n* **KNOW THE DAMN GRAPHS** – (I didn’t have to draw one on the OA but definitely put one on your whiteboard and know what the lines mean. The OA generally asks you in words, not in pictures.) Marginal cost/Marginal revenue (understand what these are **AND** what they mean **AND** how they apply to each firm type) Shut down rule. Fixed cost/variable cost/total cost. What happens to demand curves when you change prices or supply, what happens to price and quantity equilibrium. What are consumer/producer surplus, what increases/decreases their size, and where they are located on the graph.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**The MOST important thing** to understand for this class is the relationship and cause and effect (or implication) of changes. To me, economics has similarities to a balance sheet in accounting. You will get plenty of questions like \"If X decreases, and everything else remains constant, what happens to Y?\" -or- \"If X changes in Y direction, what happens to Z?\"\\n\\nKeywords that will **FUCK YOU UP** if you miss them in a question: Demand, supply, quantity, price, constant, NOT, elastic, inelastic, economic profit, variable cost, fixed cost, long run, short run.\\n\\n**TIP**: Many answers are very similar, often different by just one or two words. Read all the answers before answering a question, then slow down and read them again. If you don’t, you’re basically just guessing.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI sure had a hard time with this class and I’ve heard others have too, so I hope this post helps future students!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR** Bolded stuff is most important to know for OA</td>\n",

As an accelerator, I often check Reddit for tips before starting a class but found that most posts for this class were a couple years old.  I'm no accounting wiz and find accounting a major bore so I had difficulty studying for more than 2-3 hours at a time.  All together it took me 14 days but I probably could have finished in 7.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\nGo thru the entire course,  yep, all 11 chapters. I did very little reading, but instead, watched the videos in each chapter. **The guy in the video explains EVERYTHING you need to know to pass this course** and I found the videos less boring than reading 11 chapters.  Make sure to take notes and complete **ALL** chapter quizzes. The quizzes are key to preparing for the OA.  Score around 80 or better on the quizzes and you will have no problem passing this class.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis and Cost Systems make up 77% of the test (about 53 of the 69 test questions) so make sure you understand these concepts. Technically, if you aced these two competencies, you could fail the rest of the test and still pass the class although I don't recommend this strategy. Financial Analysis is chapters 1-6 and Cost Systems is chapter 9.\\n\\nDon't try to memorize the accounting formulas. They all are provided during the test and reading the question will direct you to the appropriate formula to use.\\n\\nThere are 4-6 math questions that can be tricky if you overthink the question. It's all basic 9th grade arithmetic but double check your answers.  If you can pass the math on the PA you will be fine.\\n\\nThe PA and OA are **very** similar however, in addition to the formulas and equations, the OA questions are designed more to test your knowledge of the concepts. (These type questions may actually seem easier for those that grasp concepts quickly).\\n\\nFinally, if you get stuck, contact your Course Instructor. They can quickly get you back on track. For some reason, budgeting was a mental block for me. I understood the concept but at test time my brain turned to mush.  My CI shared some tricks to use and the bulb lit! I can now do budgeting in my sleep.\\n\\nI think that's it and I hope this helps anyone that is looking for an edge.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, drop me a line.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkt273bwjax71.png?width=1649&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5fe0fd7d3c21dc7bebd2cc1d23ccc5072332b63d</td>\n",

       "      <td>Passed C211! Tips\\nI passed my OA today and here is what I did! \\n\\nBackground: no background in business or econ but I do have an undergrad in a science field. Full time job, parent, and busy life so this course took me 4 weeks of studying about 2 hours a day, M-F afterwork and the occasional hour or two on the weekend. \\n\\nWhat I did: \\n1. I read or at least skimmed all the chapters and did the quizzes at each end. What i mean by that is that sometimes I skimmed through if I grapsed the concepts quickly, or sometimes I read more thoroughly if I wasn't catching on as quickly. \\nI also did the quizzes at the end of each chapter. \\n \\n2. I went through these flashcards at least twice per week to familiarize myself with the terms and concepts https://quizlet.com/156324642/wgu-c211-global-economics-for-managers-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&amp;i=1kulzy\\n\\n3. I almost didn't do this third one and I think I would've been underreported had I not: watched the webinars. I thought with all of the reading and quizzes in the text, I'd just be wasting my time with the videos BUT I figured what the heck, I'll see what they're about. They helped A LOT. Especially the ones by Dr. Amy-Michele Roberts. She seems awesome and I loved her lectures. Super helpful. \\n\\n4. I completed the study guide in Course tips and reviewed the market structure table that Dr. Amy Michele covers. I reviewed both once or twice before the PA. \\n\\n5. Completed my PA with an Exemplary score. I felt very confident and so I scheduled the exam for later the same day. In the meantime I reviewed my coaching report, went through the flashcards again, and studied some concepts I saw on the PA that I wasn't familiar with (another redditor said that if you saw a concept of the PA, it's sister concept, such as mercantilism and absolute advantage, would be on the OA)\\n\\n6. OA. I did pass first time, but I felt the questions were very different from the PA. In style and the concepts they covered. Maybe two were verbatim, a few similar, but the rest completely different. My advice is to know the concepts well and be able to reason through the questions. \\n\\nPosting because I learned so much about strategies for moving through these courses from reddit, so I'm hoping my experience can help/encourage someone else! \\n\\nHooray for last exam of my MBA!

So long story short--this class was, in my opinion, the toughest for me to get over. I'm actually very surprised I managed to complete this course from start to OA finish within 7 days!\\n\\nSo here's what I did:\\n\\n1.) Like anyone else, I researched previous posts for tips and guidance and ultimately landed on this strategy. (I highly recommend you follow it to some capacity--it really helped me focus on what I NEEDED to know vs what I could sort of kinda be familiar with.)  \\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/)\\n\\nIf I were you, I would memorize the following cheat sheet:\\n\\n\\- memorize the Market Types and Characteristics of each (brain dump to your whiteboard when you test)  \\n\\- \"Harry's Many Friendly Dogs Make Fun, Interesting Playmates, Offering Unique Hugs\" which basically means:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7dk0uy3a0fe1.png?width=1068&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1f5671ba1b7e1afacf731deead0c3164dd9aa31e\\n\\n\\- draw the Supply and Demand curves (watch this video to learn how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfAuucWr2Do)\\n\\n\\- know where the Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus is on a Demand/Supply curve\\n\\n\\- know that when the question talks about elasticity and mentions SUBSTITUTION think POSITIVE and COMPLEMENT think NEGATIVE\\n\\n\\- know what increases or decreases the money supply\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12xet3uta0fe1.png?width=677&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74efe004360bf54221ff4beef94d93ba69b9a0ce\\n\\n2.) A fellow student shared their notes with me (basically it's the v3 Study Guide with answers filled in already) so I took them and imported to my iPad as a PDF and wrote extra notes as I read through to get a quick overview of what the heck is being tested on. I ONLY watched the main Competency cohort videos while reading through the study guide to help me out. Dr. Baroshi(?) (I forget how you say his name but his videos are wack because he just reads off the slides and isn't helpful.) The true hero is the other Dr. that made most of the videos.\\n\\n3.) Take as many quizzes as you want (I mainly stuck to the end of chapter quizzes, not the mini quizzes since those questions were on the main end of chapter quizzes)\\n\\n4.) I downloaded the course textbooks as PDFs and imported them to Google's Notebook LM and asked it questions from the study guide or PA that I needed extra help with and it did a much better job of giving me more relevant answers than ChatGPT, because Notebook LM ONLY uses the data from the textbooks to supply answers--thereby giving me more confidence that the material I was learning was more relevant to what the course PA/OA questions are like. This helped a lot, but I also used ChatGPT to help me come up with pro tips and acronyms to remember stuff.\\n\\n5.) I studied for a minimum of 3 hours a day wherever I could find the time--it sucked, but now this test is behind me and it will be for you too!\\n\\nPro tips that helped me out:\\n\\n\\- brain dump everything your cheat sheet before answering the first question\\n\\n\\- The PA is similar to the OA so review your PA and make sure you are familiar and can recognize all the questions because you'll kick yourself when you sit for the OA and see a familiar question you saw on the PA but didn't take the time to figure out how the answer was solved\\n\\n\\- simplify the question because the questions are worded to try and trick you (for instance, instead of reading something like \"If supply decreases then what happens to price equilibrium and quantity equilibrium?\" Nah forget that, instead simplify it to something like \"If Supply increases, what happens to price and quantity?\" lol\\n\\n\\- remove answers that you know are incorrect or impossible (like I said, the questions are worded kinda difficult so if you're reading something about tariffs and a few of the answers are about unrelated stuff, rule them out) and use your best guess judgment to make a decision\\n\\n\\- breath and take your time, there are only 50 questions, so if you know your stuff the test will be quick\\n\\nI hope this helps! Feel free to hit me up on DM for a copy of my notes. On to the capstone!\\n\\n\\###########################################\\n\\nUpdate: 06/27/2025\\n\\nHey everyone, if you'd like a copy of the notes, please download a copy from this Google drive.

       "      <td>Passed C211 in three days! Tips\\nGoing into this class, I was really anxious after reading the Reddit posts hearing how long it took them or difficult it was. Thankfully, I didn’t have the same experience. It took me three days in total to do this class with no prior experience in economics or business. You can probably do it even shorter since watching all the lectures takes 4.5 hours which I split into two days and the review will take a few more hours depending on if u fill the study guide yourself or not. \\n\\nTips:\\n* (Day 1 and 2)The cohort videos for competency 3 and 4 are extremely useful and will tell you everything you need for know for the OA. Skip the ones with Dr. Behroz Baraghoshi and just read the slides instead. This will take \\n* (Day 3) Used the study guide to fill in the gaps for competencies 1, 2, 5\\n* (Day 3) DO THE END OF CHAPTER QUIZZES!!! Specifically the Pre-OA review tests for all competencies which just combines everything. It was THE MOST USEFUL, most similar to OA and has the same type of wording. I even saw the same questions from those quizzes in the OA. (I skipped competencies 3 and 4 and you can see how I did worse) \\n\\nMajority of things in my OA:\\n* Institution based view and all about that \\n* Three types of globalization \\n* OLI specifically about location \\n* Free market view \\n* Disadvantages for home country \\n* All about collusion \\n* All about 4 strategies to fight MNEs (dodger, contender, defender, extender) \\n* how inflation and interest affects exchange rate \\n* Currency hedging \\n* All about type of currency transactions (spot, forward, currency) \\n* First mover and late mover \\n* All about regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillar \\n* Civil Law, Common law, theocratic law \\n* a few questions about market economy (just pick the one with no government involvement) \\n* political risk impact \\n* properly and intellectual rights \\n* indifference curve \\n* definitions for average fixed costs, marginal costs \\n* honestly like maybe two questions about demand and supply \\n* barriers of entry \\n* MR= MC for everything, only price is different for monopolistic, monopoly, and oligopoly \\n* Nash Equillibrium and Prisonors Dilemma \\n* what increase and decreases money supply! And don’t mix up interest rate with discount rate! \\n* Deadweight loss \\n* how does tariffs affect price and demand \\n* components of gdp and examples \\n* consumer and producer surplus \\n* cross price elasticity \\n* normal and inferior good and demand \\n* fiscal policy and affect on demand \\n* affect of aggregate demand \\n\\nYou don’t need to memorize a lot of things as you can understand the concepts such as the perfect, monopolistic, etc competition or the graphs. You can either just draw the graphs to get the answer or use logic such as if supply decreases then quantity will definitely decreases and price will go up because it’s more “difficult to get”. And remember that there’s only 50 questions so it is usually the main things in every competency that they’ll ask, nothing extremely detailed.\\n\\nI just took the OA so a lot of it is fresh in my mind.

Not by any flying colors but I did it and started on capstone tonight.\\n\\nWhat I did to panic pass this exam lol\\n\\n1. Memorize the table of market types and features. The moment my exam started I wrote down my abbreviated version of this table on my whiteboard\\n2. Draw a supply and demand curve on your white board and include consumer surplus and producer surplus on there. Know which way the supply and demand curves move and what that does to price and quantity\\n3. I printed out the Key Terms and Definitions in the course resources and read these twice and made notes\\n   1. Globalization definition verbatim\\n4. I did use the completed V3 study guide that was found on Facebook MBA group and made notes. It is approximately 81 pages so I didn't print but took notes in Noteability on my iPad. It does a great job of going over most of the topics but I filled it in with my own thoughts\\n5. Non-equity and equity examples\\n6. Nobody I have seen has talked about this but [MRU.org](http://MRU.org) had some amazing videos on Macro and Microeconomics. I did not watch them all but I would review topics I was struggling with and they explained them in a very fun and engaging way.\\n   1. [https://mru.org/principles-economics-microeconomics](https://mru.org/principles-economics-microeconomics)\\n   2. [https://mru.org/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0](https://mru.org/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0)\\n   3. You can use the search feature just to look up topics or things you want elaboration on\\n7. There was only one question where I had to subtract and it was related to consumer or producer surplus\\n8. Know what will increase and decrease the money supply\\n   1. Increase Money Supply\\n      1. Open Market buy bonds\\n      2. Decrease Discount Window Rate\\n      3. Decrease Required Reserve\\n      4. Increases Aggregate Demand\\n   2. Decrease Money Supply\\n      1. OM sell\\n      2. Increase DWR\\n      3. Increase RRR\\n      4. Decrease AD\\n9. Cross Price Elasticity of Demand\\n   1. Positive relation for substitutes\\n   2. Negative relation for complements\\n10. Items that shift DEMAND curve \"PINTE\"\\n   1. Price of related goods (substitutes and compliments)\\n   2. Income (normal and inferior)\\n   3. Number of buyers\\n   4. Tastes and preferences\\n   5. Expectations of future (expect price to fall soon)\\n11. Items that shift SUPPLY curve \"iNOTE\"\\n   1. input prices\\n   2. number of sellers (more sellers more supply)\\n   3. outside options of sellers\\n   4. tech (increases productivity)\\n   5. expectations of future (holding inventory)\\n12. Costs and Benefits of FDI (I know I got this wrong on exam)\\n13. The 4 strategies to fight MNE\\n   1. Some really stupid ways I remembered them\\n      1. Contender and Extender have \"t\"s so I remembered those as TRANSFERABLE\\n      2. \"Sold out DODGEr's stadium\" - company sells out \\n      3. \"DEFEND\" home plate - home market advantage\\n14. I had a diamond theory question\\n15. Hedging, types of currency transactions\\n16. It wasn't just enough to know what regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillars were they had questions that were like \"which two are examples of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ pillar\" so make sure you understand this\\n17. Totalitarinism, Deomcracy definitions\\n18. Market, Command, and Mixed economy\\n19. 3 types of barriers to entry that can lead to a monopoly\\n20. GDP\\n21. Impact of tariffs\\n22. Deadweight loss\\n   1. The value of the trades not made b/c of tax or tariff\\n\\nI know I typed a bunch and this is kind of all I can remember (I had a few glasses of wine while I was working on my Capstone stuff). I probably would say I studied diligently for about a week and really focused this past Saturday and Sunday. I did all the quizzes in Cengage but did not actually read any of the textbooks (despite my previous posts). I will just suggest [MRU.org](http://MRU.org) once again because the videos are well organized and cover the material in a way that's fun. I only took the PA once the day I opened the course and failed it and didn't take it again.\\n\\nOpen the Course Tips and that's where the Key Terms, C211 recorded cohorts videos, and additional resources by competency (I watched all the short content videos).\\n\\nHope I paid it forward because this subreddit has been a huge resource in my journey. I am going to finish in a single term and I can't believe it. New house, new job, and soon new degree all before June 2024. Once my job pays for my MSML in a year I'm going to be right back here, doing all this stuff again.\\n\\nBest of luck everyone!</td>\n",

       "      <td>C211 And why it took me 5 months to prepare\\n# Intro\\n\\nI have *zero* background in this study area. I'm just a Soldier and a Law Enforcer, pushing to get ahead in life and chase down some big goals. So, if you're frustrated and wonder \"What the heck am I supposed to study?\" I've been there, too. This is precisely why I recently gave some tips to help you push past those initial overwhelming thoughts. So you can move forward more clearly and (hopefully) save time compared to my journey.\\n\\nRemember, \"Consistency is the Miracle.\" We are both so close to \"the finish line and at this point, we can't afford to stop. So don't be idle; let's cross this finish line together! You've got this.\\n\\n# Step 1\\n\\n# [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/)\\n\\nI found this post and the MRU videos helpful in my daily lunch breaks to review and practice what I learned. You will find that they are helpful and should be incorporated into daily education.\\n\\n# Step 2\\n\\nI'm not a fan of the book because it took forever to understand, and the quizzes did not help me understand the topics or prepare me for the pre-assessment. So, I created the following quizlet from other creators who have already done this work for you.\\n\\n[https://quizlet.com/user/Oz\\_Ramos5/folders/c211?i=ytnwg&amp;x=1xqt](https://quizlet.com/user/Oz_Ramos5/folders/c211?i=ytnwg&amp;x=1xqt)\\n\\n# Step 3\\n\\nI went to course tips, and you will find a study guide/videos on what you should be covering in the book. Yes, this helps, but I have no interest in doing this every week when I would rather play video games or play with my kids (live instead of being a drone). So, I created the following to help you (not enable you). These study guides took me 5 months to complete because of (understanding concepts and cross-referencing answers).\\n\\nI've attached them so you can look at my take on how I learn, and you will find that I put references in each section with (1-3a) or (chapter-section) to see my reference for my answer. If it's not there, it ought to give her the answer and clean it up with CHATGPT. Notice that my study guide is thorough and lengthy!  \\n[C211 Resources](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/oramo26_wgu_edu/Documents/C211%20Resources?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=3fiz4H): The link has an expiration date. If you message me, I can create a new link.\\n\\nI used Obsidian as my note-taking and building tool, so if you aren't accustomed to this, I challenge you to build your own with your creative twist.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nI found this course challenging and less helpful to my learning than I had hoped. It often felt like I was the Instructor, the student, and the teacher all at once. While self-directed study is a significant part of WGU’s approach, this course is more like, “Here’s the material—good, \"rather than a guided learning experience.\\n\\nThe course materials, including videos and the textbook, were hard to follow or needed more clarity. Practical, interactive support was also minimal. For instance, the provided practice packets didn’t always align well with actual tasks, making it challenging to gauge progress or identify improvement areas.\\n\\nOverall, it would be helpful if the course offered more structured guidance, precise explanations, and better-aligned practice resources to support independent learning more effectively.</td>\n",

       "      <td>D366 - Financial Statement Analysis\\n  \\n\\n(from 4 months ago) EDIT: passed OA 1st try after 1 week of studying. Course material is somewhat helpful, I just did the quizzes, Referenced the financial statement analysis playlist from this YT channel: [https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira](https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira) from someone who commented below, took the PA 2x, took all section quizzes, and some guy in course chatter linked a bunch of videos and I watched all of them. by far hardest class i took so far here. course is pretty disorganized. people commented below what highlighted topics to study, I agree with them.\\n\\n(4 months ago) This YouTube channel helped me so much; he covers just about every \"section\" in this class and has a playlist for Financial Statement Analysis. It's still a lot of information, but it got the ball rolling in the right direction for me.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira](https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira)\\n\\nI took the OA last night and passed. The YouTube channel I recommended really prepared me. I did about 2 days of studying &amp; note taking. The exam felt sloppy, the questions were more situational, and the multiple-choice options basically gave away the answer (not a lot of thought into the choices). I would say you 1000% need to know your formulas. How to calculate EPS, P/E, PEG, ROCE and ROA. Understand what they mean and the story they tell. Really have a good understanding of residual income and models of valuations. If you have a good grasp on how to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flows you are golden. I’d say the PA is a good way to get familiar with how the OA is structured meaning how they ask questions. The OA definitely was different but not so much where I felt lost. I wouldn’t overthink it; a lot of that exam was common sense mixed in with the formulas + scenarios.\\n\\nI’ll be honest, I didn’t touch the course material. I did however take all the quizzes and tests that you can find on the course material. It didn’t prepare me as much as the YouTube videos did. I jotted down the big topics I got stuck on for the chapter practice tests and watched the correlated video from the channel I shared.\\n\\n(3 months ago Inner-Department-217) I’m also having a LOT of trouble with this course just trying to find out what all needs to be understood for the OA. I recently took it and failed it pretty spectacularly if I might add. Compared to the practice exam I didn’t think it compared too much but I can agree with “Kowboydas” with the face that its almost all situational. I reached out to one of the Course Instructors and she gave me some key concepts to take notes on to help with the exam. I will list them below, hopefully it helps.\\n\\n\\- PEG and PE ratios.\\n\\n\\- Value of the firm based on expected growth rate\\n\\n\\- ROCE and ROA\\n\\n\\- How depreciation impacts balance sheet, cash flow, &amp; income statement\\n\\n\\- Depreciation of investment on a tax perspective\\n\\n\\- Terminology to ensure you are able to distinguish valid terms in the questions on the assessments\\n\\n\\- Leverage (impact assumptions) on PEG calculation to market and book value\\n\\n\\- Expected growth rate and expected value of the firm, plus 1 year\\n\\n\\- Expected Earnings of a firm\\n\\n\\- Options and derivatives impact or effect rather than just definitions\\n\\n\\- Convertible Bonds vs Secured Debt Financing\\n\\n(5 days ago) The instructor emailed me after I passed &amp; asked what my tactic was(I’m glad that the instructors are aware it sucks ass, but you’d think that would prompt them to, I don’t know, fix it?) Anyways, here’s my reply:\\n\\nI started off by reading the book material and taking notes until I realized that the book wasn’t making sense to me. The main issue with it is that it contains verbiage that I had to google to understand the meaning of, and a lot of it. So not only did I have to learn the content, I also had to learn the concept of the sentence itself by breaking it down. and this is over, and over, and over again. That was the most frustrating part, it often felt like trying to learn material that was written in a different language. I decided to take the advice of the other students in the course chatter and focus on the YouTube videos and articles. That made everything make sense, but the language used to explain the concepts do not line up with the questions on the OA and PA. So, not helpful, and that put me back at square one. And more confused than when I started.\\n\\nI could have passed the class in a few days if I had done the below from the beginning: Step 1: I found this study guide for a different WGU course, C213. I read and studied all concepts until it was perfectly clear, and it gave me a great base to move forward from. [study guide](https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/western-governors-university/accounting-for-decision-makers/c213-study-guide-solution/7503878?origin=home-recent-1)\\n\\nStep 2: I went through the articles posted on the \"helpful links\" document in course chatter for all areas I needed to fill in that weren’t listed on the study guide. Any concepts I still was not clear on, I found a corresponding video to help visually explain.\\n\\nStep 3: I took all the questions from the PA and created Quizlet flashcards. Studied these until I had the answers memorized. I know that's not what we want to be doing, but this helped me link individual concepts through word association. Was kind of my only option since the questions just didn't make sense to me at all.\\n\\nStep 4: I noticed there were a lot of questions on cash flow variations on the OA which was something I didn't feel super comfortable in. Since I had failed the first OA, it gave me an advantage of knowing where I was lacking, and I went through and studied those.</td>\n",

And maybe it's replacing C993 in the future? It seems like people are already switching into it from some other posts.\\n\\nAlso, I've read a lot of negative things about C192, but the Oracle test for C993 is also said to be extremely tough. I am someone who has been using Microsoft SQL Server for 20 years (and its precursor Sybase SQL before that), mostly in a programmer role but also a bit of DBA.\\n\\nI emailed my mentor so I'm mostly just impatient to hear an answer. Plus I figure it might be helpful to elevate it so other people who are in the dark like me will be aware. And I'd love to hear any firsthand info anyone has (especially those in or finished with the course since they brought it back).\\n\\nUpdate: My mentor managed to get me switched over. There was a slight hitch in that I'd already enrolled in the class. So if you want to switch, don't do that. But they managed to switch me anyway. It sounds like it's still not a regular thing they'll do, but keep it mainly for people who are failing the C993 cert test over and over and are coming up on graduation/term deadlines (or just running out of retries). My term ends in April and with this and the capstone and C777 (the easiest of the lot, especially now that CIW is gone), it was getting a little more hairy.\\n\\nI was happy to see C192 is an in-house exam with 150 minutes to do 56 questions with a cut score of 72%. One of my main fears about the Oracle test was that it was 120 minutes for 78 questions. Granted, the cut score for it would be lower - 63% - but I was really worried about the time. The pre-assessment for C993 was the first one where I ever even came *close* to running out of time. I ran out of time with a few questions skipped and definitely some hurried through, getting a 68% score. We'll see how this compares with the C192 test. But I sure found out that it's very hard for me to read unformatted SQL in a proportional font.\\n\\nI am in BSSD. I don't know how this might apply to some other majors. My degree had 122 CUs, so switching the 4 CU C993 to 3 CU C192 meant I still had 121 CUs. I think I've heard that 120 CUs is the minimum for a BS. Maybe in other degrees, dropping the hour would put you at 119 CUs?\\n\\nHope this helps.  \n",

I have no background in economics, I've also never had an economics class. I have some experience with global trade concepts through prior classes.\\n\\nThis class was weird because it first appears deceptively easy. I watched some of the recorded cohorts and found the concepts simple, but knew the class was well-known as being difficult so I must be missing something. I took the PA and bombed it miserably. BUT! you can't know what you don't know until you're faced with not knowing it- so the PA helped pin that down, especially since there were several questions I couldn't even 'process-of-elimination' my way to a right answer.\\n\\nHere's what helped me the most (after the PA):\\n\\n* Dr. Wades cohort recordings. You can find these in the course search. They give a good overview of the topics but don't go too in-depth.\\n* ACDC Econ on youtube. Jacob Clifford broke down all of the economic concepts beautifully and does a great job of showing the relationships between them while still being entertaining. I watched many of his macroeconomics and microeconomic videos.\\n* Crashcourse Economics on youtube, also starring Jacob      Clifford. The last few videos are the most helpful, but I recommend watching most of the videos in the playlist because they are short and add a lot of context to the material.\\n* Khan academy on youtube. I searched anything I still didn’t feel confident in after crashcourse and ACDC Econ. Their videos, while rather dry, were very helpful.\\n* After taking the PA, I filled out gaps in my notes by going through each question and writing down the terms and concepts that I didn’t know or wasn’t sure about, including the wrong answers.\\n* After taking the PA you can access some practice tests in the textbook. Look in the course chatter for the password to access them. Many of the questions asked on the practice tests were similar to the      OA. If you can get high scores on all the post-PA practice tests you can pass the OA. Study extra on any of these tests you score low on. I took notes on these the same way I did with the PA and used those notes to study.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat didn’t help and why:\\n\\n* Quizlet. I’m usually a real quizlet stan but in this class its not very helpful. Of course the terms and definitions are important – but the relationships between concepts are more important for this course.\\n* The provided study guide. Its overwhelming to fill out and has things you don’t need while missing things you do.\\n* The textbook reading. The quizzes were helpful, but the actual reading material was a slog. I browsed through it at first because I did attempt to fill out the study guide, but quickly found I'm not about that life.\\n* Other recorded cohorts in the course. Theres like nine of them, they are probably informative but I found them boring and hard to sit through.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThings to understand (AKA concepts I remember the OA touching on a LOT but not exact questions so hopefully this is allowed)\\n\\n* Currency exchange – understand transactions, what happens if currency value rises or falls, what causes value fluctuations? How does it affect the government and consumers of a country. How do firms mitigate risk when it comes to currency exchange.  Not all currency questions specifically mention the word currency so look for rate/exchange/monetary and other related terms.\\n* Market/command/mixed economy and theocratic/civil/common law implications\\n* Monetary policies – understand what happens when the fed changes reserve requirements, interest rates, income taxes. How do tariffs impact domestic consumers, the domestic government, the foreign business. Same with quotas.\\n* Foreign direct investment (FDI) – how does it impact domestic and global firms/public/govt/trade. Equity vs non-equity investment, what those are called, and the pros/cons of each.\\n* What counts as GDP, what is considered an investment under GDP. Difference between GDP and GNP.\\n* Price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, cross-price elasticity. What makes a product demand elastic vs inelastic? Substitution vs complementary products **KNOW THE DIFFERENCE ON A GRAPH**\\n* **KNOW MONOPOLY/OLIGOPOLY/MONOPOLISTIC/PERFECT COMPETITION** – Which ones make economic profit in longrun/shortrun, shape of their demand curve, their elasticity, price makers/takers (why), examples of their products, barriers to entry. How are they similar, how are they different? How are they affected by change.\\n* **KNOW THE DAMN GRAPHS** – (I didn’t have to draw one on the OA but definitely put one on your whiteboard and know what the lines mean. The OA generally asks you in words, not in pictures.) Marginal cost/Marginal revenue (understand what these are **AND** what they mean **AND** how they apply to each firm type) Shut down rule. Fixed cost/variable cost/total cost. What happens to demand curves when you change prices or supply, what happens to price and quantity equilibrium. What are consumer/producer surplus, what increases/decreases their size, and where they are located on the graph.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**The MOST important thing** to understand for this class is the relationship and cause and effect (or implication) of changes. To me, economics has similarities to a balance sheet in accounting. You will get plenty of questions like \"If X decreases, and everything else remains constant, what happens to Y?\" -or- \"If X changes in Y direction, what happens to Z?\"\\n\\nKeywords that will **FUCK YOU UP** if you miss them in a question: Demand, supply, quantity, price, constant, NOT, elastic, inelastic, economic profit, variable cost, fixed cost, long run, short run.\\n\\n**TIP**: Many answers are very similar, often different by just one or two words. Read all the answers before answering a question, then slow down and read them again. If you don’t, you’re basically just guessing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI sure had a hard time with this class and I’ve heard others have too, so I hope this post helps future students!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR** Bolded stuff is most important to know for OA  \n",

As an accelerator, I often check Reddit for tips before starting a class but found that most posts for this class were a couple years old.  I'm no accounting wiz and find accounting a major bore so I had difficulty studying for more than 2-3 hours at a time.  All together it took me 14 days but I probably could have finished in 7.\\n\\nTips:\\n\\nGo thru the entire course,  yep, all 11 chapters. I did very little reading, but instead, watched the videos in each chapter. **The guy in the video explains EVERYTHING you need to know to pass this course** and I found the videos less boring than reading 11 chapters.  Make sure to take notes and complete **ALL** chapter quizzes. The quizzes are key to preparing for the OA.  Score around 80 or better on the quizzes and you will have no problem passing this class.\\n\\nFinancial Analysis and Cost Systems make up 77% of the test (about 53 of the 69 test questions) so make sure you understand these concepts. Technically, if you aced these two competencies, you could fail the rest of the test and still pass the class although I don't recommend this strategy. Financial Analysis is chapters 1-6 and Cost Systems is chapter 9.\\n\\nDon't try to memorize the accounting formulas. They all are provided during the test and reading the question will direct you to the appropriate formula to use.\\n\\nThere are 4-6 math questions that can be tricky if you overthink the question. It's all basic 9th grade arithmetic but double check your answers.  If you can pass the math on the PA you will be fine.\\n\\nThe PA and OA are **very** similar however, in addition to the formulas and equations, the OA questions are designed more to test your knowledge of the concepts. (These type questions may actually seem easier for those that grasp concepts quickly).\\n\\nFinally, if you get stuck, contact your Course Instructor. They can quickly get you back on track. For some reason, budgeting was a mental block for me. I understood the concept but at test time my brain turned to mush.  My CI shared some tricks to use and the bulb lit! I can now do budgeting in my sleep.\\n\\nI think that's it and I hope this helps anyone that is looking for an edge.\\n\\nIf you have any questions, drop me a line.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkt273bwjax71.png?width=1649&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe0fd7d3c21dc7bebd2cc1d23ccc5072332b63d  \n",

Tips\\nI passed my OA today and here is what I did! \\n\\nBackground: no background in business or econ but I do have an undergrad in a science field. Full time job, parent, and busy life so this course took me 4 weeks of studying about 2 hours a day, M-F afterwork and the occasional hour or two on the weekend. \\n\\nWhat I did: \\n1. I read or at least skimmed all the chapters and did the quizzes at each end. What i mean by that is that sometimes I skimmed through if I grapsed the concepts quickly, or sometimes I read more thoroughly if I wasn't catching on as quickly. \\nI also did the quizzes at the end of each chapter. \\n \\n2. I went through these flashcards at least twice per week to familiarize myself with the terms and concepts https://quizlet.com/156324642/wgu-c211-global-economics-for-managers-flash-cards/?x=1jqU&i=1kulzy\\n\\n3. I almost didn't do this third one and I think I would've been underreported had I not: watched the webinars. I thought with all of the reading and quizzes in the text, I'd just be wasting my time with the videos BUT I figured what the heck, I'll see what they're about. They helped A LOT. Especially the ones by Dr. Amy-Michele Roberts. She seems awesome and I loved her lectures. Super helpful. \\n\\n4. I completed the study guide in Course tips and reviewed the market structure table that Dr. Amy Michele covers. I reviewed both once or twice before the PA. \\n\\n5. Completed my PA with an Exemplary score. I felt very confident and so I scheduled the exam for later the same day. In the meantime I reviewed my coaching report, went through the flashcards again, and studied some concepts I saw on the PA that I wasn't familiar with (another redditor said that if you saw a concept of the PA, it's sister concept, such as mercantilism and absolute advantage, would be on the OA)\\n\\n6. OA. I did pass first time, but I felt the questions were very different from the PA. In style and the concepts they covered. Maybe two were verbatim, a few similar, but the rest completely different. My advice is to know the concepts well and be able to reason through the questions. \\n\\nPosting because I learned so much about strategies for moving through these courses from reddit, so I'm hoping my experience can help/encourage someone else! \\n\\nHooray for last exam of my MBA! Onto the Capstone! Good luck fellow Night Owls!  \n",

So long story short--this class was, in my opinion, the toughest for me to get over. I'm actually very surprised I managed to complete this course from start to OA finish within 7 days!\\n\\nSo here's what I did:\\n\\n1.) Like anyone else, I researched previous posts for tips and guidance and ultimately landed on this strategy. (I highly recommend you follow it to some capacity--it really helped me focus on what I NEEDED to know vs what I could sort of kinda be familiar with.)  \\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/)\\n\\nIf I were you, I would memorize the following cheat sheet:\\n\\n\\- memorize the Market Types and Characteristics of each (brain dump to your whiteboard when you test)  \\n\\- \"Harry's Many Friendly Dogs Make Fun, Interesting Playmates, Offering Unique Hugs\" which basically means:\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7dk0uy3a0fe1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5671ba1b7e1afacf731deead0c3164dd9aa31e\\n\\n\\- draw the Supply and Demand curves (watch this video to learn how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfAuucWr2Do)\\n\\n\\- know where the Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus is on a Demand/Supply curve\\n\\n\\- know that when the question talks about elasticity and mentions SUBSTITUTION think POSITIVE and COMPLEMENT think NEGATIVE\\n\\n\\- know what increases or decreases the money supply\\n\\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12xet3uta0fe1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=74efe004360bf54221ff4beef94d93ba69b9a0ce\\n\\n2.) A fellow student shared their notes with me (basically it's the v3 Study Guide with answers filled in already) so I took them and imported to my iPad as a PDF and wrote extra notes as I read through to get a quick overview of what the heck is being tested on. I ONLY watched the main Competency cohort videos while reading through the study guide to help me out. Dr. Baroshi(?) (I forget how you say his name but his videos are wack because he just reads off the slides and isn't helpful.) The true hero is the other Dr. that made most of the videos.\\n\\n3.) Take as many quizzes as you want (I mainly stuck to the end of chapter quizzes, not the mini quizzes since those questions were on the main end of chapter quizzes)\\n\\n4.) I downloaded the course textbooks as PDFs and imported them to Google's Notebook LM and asked it questions from the study guide or PA that I needed extra help with and it did a much better job of giving me more relevant answers than ChatGPT, because Notebook LM ONLY uses the data from the textbooks to supply answers--thereby giving me more confidence that the material I was learning was more relevant to what the course PA/OA questions are like. This helped a lot, but I also used ChatGPT to help me come up with pro tips and acronyms to remember stuff.\\n\\n5.) I studied for a minimum of 3 hours a day wherever I could find the time--it sucked, but now this test is behind me and it will be for you too!\\n\\nPro tips that helped me out:\\n\\n\\- brain dump everything your cheat sheet before answering the first question\\n\\n\\- The PA is similar to the OA so review your PA and make sure you are familiar and can recognize all the questions because you'll kick yourself when you sit for the OA and see a familiar question you saw on the PA but didn't take the time to figure out how the answer was solved\\n\\n\\- simplify the question because the questions are worded to try and trick you (for instance, instead of reading something like \"If supply decreases then what happens to price equilibrium and quantity equilibrium?\" Nah forget that, instead simplify it to something like \"If Supply increases, what happens to price and quantity?\" lol\\n\\n\\- remove answers that you know are incorrect or impossible (like I said, the questions are worded kinda difficult so if you're reading something about tariffs and a few of the answers are about unrelated stuff, rule them out) and use your best guess judgment to make a decision\\n\\n\\- breath and take your time, there are only 50 questions, so if you know your stuff the test will be quick\\n\\nI hope this helps! Feel free to hit me up on DM for a copy of my notes. On to the capstone!\\n\\n\\###########################################\\n\\nUpdate: 06/27/2025\\n\\nHey everyone, if you'd like a copy of the notes, please download a copy from this Google drive.

Tips\\nGoing into this class, I was really anxious after reading the Reddit posts hearing how long it took them or difficult it was. Thankfully, I didn’t have the same experience. It took me three days in total to do this class with no prior experience in economics or business. You can probably do it even shorter since watching all the lectures takes 4.5 hours which I split into two days and the review will take a few more hours depending on if u fill the study guide yourself or not. \\n\\nTips:\\n* (Day 1 and 2)The cohort videos for competency 3 and 4 are extremely useful and will tell you everything you need for know for the OA. Skip the ones with Dr. Behroz Baraghoshi and just read the slides instead. This will take \\n* (Day 3) Used the study guide to fill in the gaps for competencies 1, 2, 5\\n* (Day 3) DO THE END OF CHAPTER QUIZZES!!! Specifically the Pre-OA review tests for all competencies which just combines everything. It was THE MOST USEFUL, most similar to OA and has the same type of wording. I even saw the same questions from those quizzes in the OA. (I skipped competencies 3 and 4 and you can see how I did worse) \\n\\nMajority of things in my OA:\\n* Institution based view and all about that \\n* Three types of globalization \\n* OLI specifically about location \\n* Free market view \\n* Disadvantages for home country \\n* All about collusion \\n* All about 4 strategies to fight MNEs (dodger, contender, defender, extender) \\n* how inflation and interest affects exchange rate \\n* Currency hedging \\n* All about type of currency transactions (spot, forward, currency) \\n* First mover and late mover \\n* All about regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillar \\n* Civil Law, Common law, theocratic law \\n* a few questions about market economy (just pick the one with no government involvement) \\n* political risk impact \\n* properly and intellectual rights \\n* indifference curve \\n* definitions for average fixed costs, marginal costs \\n* honestly like maybe two questions about demand and supply \\n* barriers of entry \\n* MR= MC for everything, only price is different for monopolistic, monopoly, and oligopoly \\n* Nash Equillibrium and Prisonors Dilemma \\n* what increase and decreases money supply! And don’t mix up interest rate with discount rate! \\n* Deadweight loss \\n* how does tariffs affect price and demand \\n* components of gdp and examples \\n* consumer and producer surplus \\n* cross price elasticity \\n* normal and inferior good and demand \\n* fiscal policy and affect on demand \\n* affect of aggregate demand \\n\\nYou don’t need to memorize a lot of things as you can understand the concepts such as the perfect, monopolistic, etc competition or the graphs. You can either just draw the graphs to get the answer or use logic such as if supply decreases then quantity will definitely decreases and price will go up because it’s more “difficult to get”. And remember that there’s only 50 questions so it is usually the main things in every competency that they’ll ask, nothing extremely detailed.\\n\\nI just took the OA so a lot of it is fresh in my mind.

Thrilled to pass the last class so that I can move onto my capstone, by March! Did I forget to mention, my goal was to complete my MBA before giving birth to my first baby at the end of this month?? Yes, a lot of pressure  but she was my motivation to accelerate! So i'm going to share with you all how I passed on my first try and THANK YOU ALL TO other reddit forums/advice because I'm passing the tips to anyone who's struggling to grasp the concepts in this class, as I sure did, especially the disengaging videos/material that literally put me to sleep and seriously discouraging! (Ahem..Dr. B..) \\n\\nOk here it goes! 📝\\n\\n3 most important things: Review the reddit links below, review the WGU materials Additional Resources by Competency, and USE, I MEAN 100% take advantage of CHATGPT/Gemini to expand on unfamiliar terms and ask for examples!! \\n\\nBest resources EVER is by following the tips from these posts, and thank you to all who've shared this, I couldn't have done it!

Not by any flying colors but I did it and started on capstone tonight.\\n\\nWhat I did to panic pass this exam lol\\n\\n1. Memorize the table of market types and features. The moment my exam started I wrote down my abbreviated version of this table on my whiteboard\\n2. Draw a supply and demand curve on your white board and include consumer surplus and producer surplus on there. Know which way the supply and demand curves move and what that does to price and quantity\\n3. I printed out the Key Terms and Definitions in the course resources and read these twice and made notes\\n   1. Globalization definition verbatim\\n4. I did use the completed V3 study guide that was found on Facebook MBA group and made notes. It is approximately 81 pages so I didn't print but took notes in Noteability on my iPad. It does a great job of going over most of the topics but I filled it in with my own thoughts\\n5. Non-equity and equity examples\\n6. Nobody I have seen has talked about this but [MRU.org](http://MRU.org) had some amazing videos on Macro and Microeconomics. I did not watch them all but I would review topics I was struggling with and they explained them in a very fun and engaging way.\\n   1. [https://mru.org/principles-economics-microeconomics](https://mru.org/principles-economics-microeconomics)\\n   2. [https://mru.org/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0](https://mru.org/principles-economics-macroeconomics-0)\\n   3. You can use the search feature just to look up topics or things you want elaboration on\\n7. There was only one question where I had to subtract and it was related to consumer or producer surplus\\n8. Know what will increase and decrease the money supply\\n   1. Increase Money Supply\\n      1. Open Market buy bonds\\n      2. Decrease Discount Window Rate\\n      3. Decrease Required Reserve\\n      4. Increases Aggregate Demand\\n   2. Decrease Money Supply\\n      1. OM sell\\n      2. Increase DWR\\n      3. Increase RRR\\n      4. Decrease AD\\n9. Cross Price Elasticity of Demand\\n   1. Positive relation for substitutes\\n   2. Negative relation for complements\\n10. Items that shift DEMAND curve \"PINTE\"\\n   1. Price of related goods (substitutes and compliments)\\n   2. Income (normal and inferior)\\n   3. Number of buyers\\n   4. Tastes and preferences\\n   5. Expectations of future (expect price to fall soon)\\n11. Items that shift SUPPLY curve \"iNOTE\"\\n   1. input prices\\n   2. number of sellers (more sellers more supply)\\n   3. outside options of sellers\\n   4. tech (increases productivity)\\n   5. expectations of future (holding inventory)\\n12. Costs and Benefits of FDI (I know I got this wrong on exam)\\n13. The 4 strategies to fight MNE\\n   1. Some really stupid ways I remembered them\\n      1. Contender and Extender have \"t\"s so I remembered those as TRANSFERABLE\\n      2. \"Sold out DODGEr's stadium\" - company sells out \\n      3. \"DEFEND\" home plate - home market advantage\\n14. I had a diamond theory question\\n15. Hedging, types of currency transactions\\n16. It wasn't just enough to know what regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillars were they had questions that were like \"which two are examples of \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ pillar\" so make sure you understand this\\n17. Totalitarinism, Deomcracy definitions\\n18. Market, Command, and Mixed economy\\n19. 3 types of barriers to entry that can lead to a monopoly\\n20. GDP\\n21. Impact of tariffs\\n22. Deadweight loss\\n   1. The value of the trades not made b/c of tax or tariff\\n\\nI know I typed a bunch and this is kind of all I can remember (I had a few glasses of wine while I was working on my Capstone stuff). I probably would say I studied diligently for about a week and really focused this past Saturday and Sunday. I did all the quizzes in Cengage but did not actually read any of the textbooks (despite my previous posts). I will just suggest [MRU.org](http://MRU.org) once again because the videos are well organized and cover the material in a way that's fun. I only took the PA once the day I opened the course and failed it and didn't take it again.\\n\\nOpen the Course Tips and that's where the Key Terms, C211 recorded cohorts videos, and additional resources by competency (I watched all the short content videos).\\n\\nHope I paid it forward because this subreddit has been a huge resource in my journey. I am going to finish in a single term and I can't believe it. New house, new job, and soon new degree all before June 2024. Once my job pays for my MSML in a year I'm going to be right back here, doing all this stuff again.\\n\\nBest of luck everyone!  \n",

I'm just a Soldier and a Law Enforcer, pushing to get ahead in life and chase down some big goals. So, if you're frustrated and wonder \"What the heck am I supposed to study?\" I've been there, too. This is precisely why I recently gave some tips to help you push past those initial overwhelming thoughts. So you can move forward more clearly and (hopefully) save time compared to my journey.\\n\\nRemember, \"Consistency is the Miracle.\" We are both so close to \"the finish line and at this point, we can't afford to stop. So don't be idle; let's cross this finish line together! You've got this.\\n\\n# Step 1\\n\\n# [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/)\\n\\nI found this post and the MRU videos helpful in my daily lunch breaks to review and practice what I learned. You will find that they are helpful and should be incorporated into daily education.\\n\\n# Step 2\\n\\nI'm not a fan of the book because it took forever to understand, and the quizzes did not help me understand the topics or prepare me for the pre-assessment. So, I created the following quizlet from other creators who have already done this work for you.\\n\\n[https://quizlet.com/user/Oz\\_Ramos5/folders/c211?i=ytnwg&x=1xqt](https://quizlet.com/user/Oz_Ramos5/folders/c211?i=ytnwg&x=1xqt)\\n\\n# Step 3\\n\\nI went to course tips, and you will find a study guide/videos on what you should be covering in the book. Yes, this helps, but I have no interest in doing this every week when I would rather play video games or play with my kids (live instead of being a drone). So, I created the following to help you (not enable you). These study guides took me 5 months to complete because of (understanding concepts and cross-referencing answers).\\n\\nI've attached them so you can look at my take on how I learn, and you will find that I put references in each section with (1-3a) or (chapter-section) to see my reference for my answer. If it's not there, it ought to give her the answer and clean it up with CHATGPT. Notice that my study guide is thorough and lengthy!  \\n[C211 Resources](https://westerngovernorsuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/personal/oramo26_wgu_edu/Documents/C211%20Resources?csf=1&web=1&e=3fiz4H): The link has an expiration date. If you message me, I can create a new link.\\n\\nI used Obsidian as my note-taking and building tool, so if you aren't accustomed to this, I challenge you to build your own with your creative twist.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nI found this course challenging and less helpful to my learning than I had hoped. It often felt like I was the Instructor, the student, and the teacher all at once. While self-directed study is a significant part of WGU’s approach, this course is more like, “Here’s the material—good, \"rather than a guided learning experience.\\n\\nThe course materials, including videos and the textbook, were hard to follow or needed more clarity. Practical, interactive support was also minimal. For instance, the provided practice packets didn’t always align well with actual tasks, making it challenging to gauge progress or identify improvement areas.\\n\\nOverall, it would be helpful if the course offered more structured guidance, precise explanations, and better-aligned practice resources to support independent learning more effectively.  \n",

Course material is somewhat helpful, I just did the quizzes, Referenced the financial statement analysis playlist from this YT channel: [https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira](https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira) from someone who commented below, took the PA 2x, took all section quizzes, and some guy in course chatter linked a bunch of videos and I watched all of them. by far hardest class i took so far here. course is pretty disorganized. people commented below what highlighted topics to study, I agree with them.\\n\\n(4 months ago) This YouTube channel helped me so much; he covers just about every \"section\" in this class and has a playlist for Financial Statement Analysis. It's still a lot of information, but it got the ball rolling in the right direction for me.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira](https://www.youtube.com/@Edspira)\\n\\nI took the OA last night and passed. The YouTube channel I recommended really prepared me. I did about 2 days of studying & note taking. The exam felt sloppy, the questions were more situational, and the multiple-choice options basically gave away the answer (not a lot of thought into the choices). I would say you 1000% need to know your formulas. How to calculate EPS, P/E, PEG, ROCE and ROA. Understand what they mean and the story they tell. Really have a good understanding of residual income and models of valuations. If you have a good grasp on how to read balance sheets, income statements and cash flows you are golden. I’d say the PA is a good way to get familiar with how the OA is structured meaning how they ask questions. The OA definitely was different but not so much where I felt lost. I wouldn’t overthink it; a lot of that exam was common sense mixed in with the formulas + scenarios.\\n\\nI’ll be honest, I didn’t touch the course material. I did however take all the quizzes and tests that you can find on the course material. It didn’t prepare me as much as the YouTube videos did. I jotted down the big topics I got stuck on for the chapter practice tests and watched the correlated video from the channel I shared.\\n\\n(3 months ago Inner-Department-217) I’m also having a LOT of trouble with this course just trying to find out what all needs to be understood for the OA. I recently took it and failed it pretty spectacularly if I might add. Compared to the practice exam I didn’t think it compared too much but I can agree with “Kowboydas” with the face that its almost all situational. I reached out to one of the Course Instructors and she gave me some key concepts to take notes on to help with the exam. I will list them below, hopefully it helps.\\n\\n\\- PEG and PE ratios.\\n\\n\\- Value of the firm based on expected growth rate\\n\\n\\- ROCE and ROA\\n\\n\\- How depreciation impacts balance sheet, cash flow, & income statement\\n\\n\\- Depreciation of investment on a tax perspective\\n\\n\\- Terminology to ensure you are able to distinguish valid terms in the questions on the assessments\\n\\n\\- Leverage (impact assumptions) on PEG calculation to market and book value\\n\\n\\- Expected growth rate and expected value of the firm, plus 1 year\\n\\n\\- Expected Earnings of a firm\\n\\n\\- Options and derivatives impact or effect rather than just definitions\\n\\n\\- Convertible Bonds vs Secured Debt Financing\\n\\n(5 days ago) The instructor emailed me after I passed & asked what my tactic was(I’m glad that the instructors are aware it sucks ass, but you’d think that would prompt them to, I don’t know, fix it?) Anyways, here’s my reply:\\n\\nI started off by reading the book material and taking notes until I realized that the book wasn’t making sense to me. The main issue with it is that it contains verbiage that I had to google to understand the meaning of, and a lot of it. So not only did I have to learn the content, I also had to learn the concept of the sentence itself by breaking it down. and this is over, and over, and over again. That was the most frustrating part, it often felt like trying to learn material that was written in a different language. I decided to take the advice of the other students in the course chatter and focus on the YouTube videos and articles. That made everything make sense, but the language used to explain the concepts do not line up with the questions on the OA and PA. So, not helpful, and that put me back at square one. And more confused than when I started.\\n\\nI could have passed the class in a few days if I had done the below from the beginning: Step 1: I found this study guide for a different WGU course, C213. I read and studied all concepts until it was perfectly clear, and it gave me a great base to move forward from. [study guide](https://www.studocu.com/en-us/document/western-governors-university/accounting-for-decision-makers/c213-study-guide-solution/7503878?origin=home-recent-1)\\n\\nStep 2: I went through the articles posted on the \"helpful links\" document in course chatter for all areas I needed to fill in that weren’t listed on the study guide. Any concepts I still was not clear on, I found a corresponding video to help visually explain.\\n\\nStep 3: I took all the questions from the PA and created Quizlet flashcards. Studied these until I had the answers memorized. I know that's not what we want to be doing, but this helped me link individual concepts through word association. Was kind of my only option since the questions just didn't make sense to me at all.\\n\\nStep 4: I noticed there were a lot of questions on cash flow variations on the OA which was something I didn't feel super comfortable in. Since I had failed the first OA, it gave me an advantage of knowing where I was lacking, and I went through and studied those.  "

       "      <td>Tips for Accelerating Your MBA (or Not!) - Course Tips &amp; Recommended Resources\\nLet me start by saying this. I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips &amp; Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations &amp; Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&amp;D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!</td>\n",

       "      <td>I finished this program today in a little over 3 months. I transferred 50 credits and work full time (Non IT). Here are my thoughts. Very long read!\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n[Proof of Completion](https://preview.redd.it/4372ewij6r5b1.jpg?width=1026&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b92d9611f3e8c135bf5b9ea582ef9d423b96d820)\\n\\n[Completed Progress Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/kcx3uvij6r5b1.jpg?width=1921&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=82c94084e66ec02294d3990bcebe5cc3bfd4c42a)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, there are a lot of grammatical errors in this. I know. I do not care because I’m too lazy to proof read and fix them.\\n\\nAnyways I finished this degree program in a little over 3 months (105 days to be exact) after transferring about 50 credits. I also work full time with some fairly demanding hours. I do not have any professional IT work experience, but I can navigate around a computer. I also just find the subject matter interesting. I did do the computer science program last year and graduated from that in 1 term in August of 2022. My plan was to go to grad school in Spring of 2023, but I ended up missing all my deadlines and had to wait and apply for Summer/Fall Semester of 2023. I did end up getting accepted to University of Illinois (Urbana Campus) Masters in Computer Science (Data Science Track) for Fall of 2023…which was a shocker because it’s a Top 5 school for computer science. Data science has always been my main goal, but I had all this time in between from when I applied to when the Fall semester would start. Cybersecurity was always on my list of things to learn, but I always had other priorities. Now that I had this gap of time that I could do whatever with, it was a good time for me to get into it. I originally thought about going the route of just doing certs because I already have a CS degree, but I would have just mostly done the same certs that WGU offers in their Cybersecurity program. It would have cost a little less than the actual degree, but still roughly in the same ball park if done in 1 term. Considering that I would be attaining the same certs anyways and the cost is comparable, I figure I might as well do the program and get the degree out of it as well, even though I would likely never use the degree on my resume (with exceptions) as CS “trumps” Cybersecurity. At the least, it helped me stay on track and in focus. I gotta be honest, I enjoyed it alot more than I did computer science and it really got me questioning what path I want to take in my future. I’m still going to grad school (it was a miracle that I even got excepted there), but I may defer to next year (University of Illinois allows that) as I’m thinking I want to take Cyber Security further and dive into different areas. Below is a recap of classes that may or may not help you.\\n\\nHowever, before I get into it, I would just like to point out that I have been working in the construction project management field for the last decade after I finished my first stint (of many) in college (civil engineering). Needless to say, those who are in the engineering/construction field live and die by the schedule so I have a habit of making a schedule for every significant (sometimes insignificant) things I do. I included the schedule I made for this program. I started in March and assigned myself durations to complete the entire program within 1 term and giving myself more weight to what classes I thought would be more demanding and vise-versa. This is the schedule that I would live by and you can see I was on track until I did my 4th class (Networks D325) which is when I started accelerating like crazy. The durations shown are my actuals and the grey bars you see in the gantt chart is my baseline schedule snapshot of what my original schedule was when I first made it. You can compare the 2 and see how much I blew my original schedule out of the water. Most of the classes were done much quicker than my projection. Capstone was the only one that took longer (only by 4 days). Seeing a visual of your progress helps keep you on track and is a motivating factor. I would suggest everyone put a schedule together of some sort.\\n\\n**IT Foundations – D316 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I never had a job in IT, I just grew up using a computer just like everyone else in this program. I felt alot of these questions were really basic questions and if you know your way around a computer you can probably answer most of them without heavy studying. That being said, even though it is a basic certification, I feel like I actually got alot out this course as it made me touch on things that I wouldn’t have otherwise yet is still good to know…things like differences between cpu architecture and differences in memory types, etc… stuff you don’t normally think about. I found those things to be quite interesting. The only PBQ I remember was having to simulate putting together 2 desktops, one being high performance and one being for general office use, you have to pick the right components for each desktop based on the parameters in the question. For studying I partially watched the Total Seminar Series to fill in gaps and did a few Messer practice exams. I also did practice questions from crucialexams dot com. That is one of my favorite resources. Check that site out if you do not already know about it. That was all that was needed.\\n\\n**IT Applications – D317 (17 Days…I didn’t actually spend 17 days on this course, I was inactive for 10 days)**\\n\\n\\- Part 2 of the A+ exam. I have a similar view to how I viewed “IT Foundations” (Part 1 of A+ exam). About the same difficulty as Part 1. However, alot of it seemed like it was common sense considering you didn’t just start using a computer yesterday. Many of the questions you can come up with the right answer by just logically using process of elimination. On my particular exam, it was heavy on questions regarding system tools and commands. Those were the things you are really going to want to pay attention to study for. For studying, I mainly only watched the Total Seminar Series and did some Professor Messer exams and crucial exams.\\n\\n**Legal Issues in Information Security – C841 (10 Days…had 1 revision to do)**\\n\\n\\- I didn’t read any course material. I just read what the assignment was and used outside resources to learn and fill any gaps that I had to complete the assignment. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. I had no interest in this class whatsoever and I just blew through the assignment in a few days. I could have certainly spent longer time and get in depth with the course material, but it just was not important to me and I opted to just get this class done as fast as possible. It is a very easy class if you want it to be.\\n\\n**Networks – D325 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Of all classes, this was one the most demanding for me and the most important. Networking is the foundation to everything in this program and it would behoove you take as much time needed to understand the concepts. I would encourage all of you to build some sort of homelab which can be done dirt cheap. Exam wise, it was difficult because of all the acronyms you need to remember which makes it unnecessarily difficult, but the questions themselves were not tricky and fairly straightforward except the PBQs which are nonsensical in how they are asked. In my PBQs I was asked to set up/configure a network and WIFI and was also asked to troubleshoot a network. The questions were pretty comprehensive across the board and there were a few questions on port numbers, OSI model questions (know what layer does what and what types of programs or hardware pertains to each layer), network topography, wireless standards and a bunch of questions on various plans/policies and a bunch of questions on command line utilities (learn these!). I also had maybe 3 questions on CIDR notation, but I did not have to compute anything. Again, know your acronyms! For this test, I watched the total seminar series, practice exams on crucial exams, a couple of Dion practice exams (only partially) and referenced Mike Meyers’ CompTIA Network+ Certification Passport Book. I really liked this book. His “all in one” book goes more in depth (I have it but didn’t read it much), but the Certification Passport book was much better to look up a topic and briefly read about it when going over things you need to go over. Watching the video series and then using this book as a backup was all I really needed. I did a few quick reviews on crucial exams to build some confidence.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity – C844 (3 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read any course material, I just went straight to the assignment and chipped away at it all day. I thought this class was useful as it gave you an introductory on how to use Wireshark and Nmap. Wireshark is a very cool program. Lots of features to analyze traffic. I did not read the course material for this class as the Nmap portion was easy to figure out without having to really look anything up, but for the Wireshark portion, I only watched the Udemy course: “Getting Started with Wireshark: The Ultimate Hands-On Course” by David Bombal. Excellent course and will provide you with all you need. This guy is very passionate about his Wireshark! I highly recommend this Udemy course and get as much as you can out of it. There are others, but this one was the best one that I was able to come across.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications – D329 (7 Days)**\\n\\n\\- This class is the class that requires the Security+. I found this exam to be fairly easy because there is a lot of overlap from Network+. Just like Network+ there is a lot of memorization of acronyms needed. I apologize as I don’t have much to offer on this because I don’t remember the specifics of what was on it. It is just kind of one big blur. I remember it being shockingly easy compared to Network+ like if you passed Network+ you could probably take this the next day and pass it after reviewing all the common types of attacks. For studying, I just watched the Security+ course on udemy by TIA Education, Andrew Ramdayal. He was actually pretty good, straight to the point on topics with no fluff. Probably not everyone’s “cup of tea”. Also, probably could have gone a little more in depth in some areas, but I would take this over Dion Training any day. Hell, I would take anything over Dion Training. Ramdayal strictly sticks to the objectives laid out exactly the way Comptia has their test laid out. It was easy to goto each one and pick the things you need to work on. I did no practice exams. Went straight to the official exam after I finished the video series. I do remember that one of the PBQs was setting up a firewall.\\n\\n**Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity – D431 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read the course material, I just went straight to the assignment and used outside resources and Udemy to guide me. I actually found this course to be quite fun. You will have (2) PAs and an OA to do. The first PA is that you have to create an investigation plan per best practices. The 2nd PA was fun as you will need to run a program called “Autopsy”, where you have to analyze a disk image and put a story together about what crime will likely be committed based on the evidence you found when doing your forensics. As far as the OA goes, know your tools, Windows/Linux/Mac log types and folder locations, what different parts of your Windows registry does and the various Federal Laws (critical). The preassessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty and style. That was really the only study aid I used.\\n\\n**Information Systems Security – C845 (10 Days)**\\n\\nYou will need to pass your SSCP for this one. I wrote a post on this class before. However here is a brief TLDR recap from my previous post on couple of things for you to remember:\\n\\n\\- The SSCP Practice Exam Book by Nick Mitropoulous is a fairly good representation of the exam and is the only thing I used.\\n\\n\\- This was an easier version of Security+. If you passed A+, Net+ and Sec+ than this exam will be fairly easy.\\n\\n\\- questions seem to be spread out evenly across the board for the most part, with the exception that there were very few questions on “cryptography” (I had maybe 5 or 6 that I can remember), but there were seemingly a bunch of questions regarding “identity access”. They weren’t difficult, but that section definitely had the most weight. Be sure you know the concepts behind the “who I am”, “what I know”, “what I have” principles as there were a lot of questions on that.\\n\\n\\- There were no trick questions and you don’t have to worry about remembering acronyms\\n\\n\\- Don’t psych yourself out. The most obvious answers are like the correct answers. There were no trick questions.\\n\\n\\- This is very important, read the question very carefully and really think about your answer when it comes to the “best”, “worst” and “most likely/unlikely” questions. These questions have multiple right answers so they can be kind of difficult. You have to consider how you are answering that question because you will get questions like “What is the best course of action in this (insert scenario)? Choose: A, B, C or D. Lets say the answer “A” and “B” are both definitely correct in the scenario, but choice “B” might be a step that you would do in part of step described in choice “A”. So the answer would be “A”. These are not trick questions, but you really need to think how answers integrate with others to pick the best choice. These questions were probably the most “trickiest”, but if you know to look out for them and think logically, you will be ok\\n\\n**Introduction to Cryptography – D334 (8 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed my first OA attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. Lots of memorization in this class. Just like all the other threads you will see about this course. Shawn’s Course Study Guide/Notes found in course chatter is all you need. The book is ok, but is pretty dry. Shawn did a very good job on his study guide. Its all you need! Get familiar with that and then do his practice exams for each chapter. You will pass. The PA and his practice exams were pretty close to the OA in terms of difficulty and style of question. Lots of memorization. I’m probably in the minority here, but I thought the subject matter was very interesting. I think about this stuff when I download programs and visit websites and stuff. It only took me about a week to finish this class, but I got pretty immersed in it. The concept of cryptography is pretty much engrained in me. Regarding the exam, questions seemed to be more skewed towards PKI, Wireless Encryption Protocols and Tunneling. These seem to show up the most on my exam and there were very few questions on blockchain/crypto currency and lightweight cryptography. The rest of the topics were pretty evenly distributed. It was a good introductory course in my opinion.\\n\\n**Managing Information Security – C843 (4 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Didn’t read any course material. Just read and did the assignment. You will need to do an incident analysis and response as well as a risk assessment. There is a lot of crap you are going to have to discuss and write about, such as legal acts, tools, techniques for gathering and analyzing, examination process etc…. It’s a very annoying assignment. I did not care for it in the slightest.\\n\\n**Cyber Defense and Countermeasures – D340 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- The CYSA+ is required for this class. WGU is enforcing a policy where accelerators can only have one class approved at a time and the program must be taken in a specific order….atleast that is what my mentor told me and won’t budge on it. The reason I’m mentioning this is because the order in which they have you do classes makes sense and does a good job preparing you systematically in my opinion. Every class builds on each other and the time you are required to take the CYSA+ is the right time. That being said, I felt the CYSA+ is a much harder version of the Security+. It went much deeper in security concepts compared to the Sec+ and I found some aspects of it to be rather difficult. However, all the Comptia exams you have taken so far preps you for the CYSA+. The cryptography class taken before this class, covers most of the cryptography questions on this exam. The digital forensics course that we have to take before this was sufficient enough to not have to do in depth studying for this exam. For studying, I just blew through the Total Seminar CYSA+ Series on Udemy and did a quick run through with things I was not familiar with the CYSA+ Certification Passport Book by Bobby Rogers. I did not do any practice exams. My lack of study was due to me being over confident. The PBQs were fun though. From what I remember, they all had to do with using nmap to determine what specific servers did and log trouble shooting. That was pretty much the gist of all the PBQs. They were pretty straight forward. &lt;750 is considered a fail…I passed with a 751 on the first attempt. Probably should have done some practice exams to get that score up a little. Pass is a pass!\\n\\n**Managing Cloud Security – D320 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed this OA by a slim margin the first attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. The instructor for this course was a relief because he just let me do it after I told him I reviewed the book the previous day. Normally they make you do a bulls\\\\\\*\\\\\\*t generic study plan and make you jump through a bunch hoops. Apparently the course was redone and a new exam had been made following the CCSP text book. This test was a doozy as there are 125 questions. However, just going over the book is sufficient. It was for me anyways. A lot of it will be a review which makes studying quite quick. It followed the book quite nicely. There were no curve balls and the questions were pretty straight forward. I’d probably say that the most sh\\\\\\*tty thing was having to memorize the various laws and frameworks. This is a must! You also need to make sure you are familiar with all the different frameworks and standards, quantitative risk assessment, uptime institute, data lifecycle, SOC report types, Software Development Lifecycle and Stride Threat Model.\\n\\n**Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis – D332 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\* This is taken from a previous post I made after I finished this class. Im reposting it here so you don’t have to search for it.\\*\\n\\n\\- By far the most difficult exam in my opinion. This was the only Comptia test that I failed the first time. All the Comptia exams kind of built off the previous and you could make your way around the exams without feeling completely lost. Pentest+ was different, the previous exams will help you very little. The things you really have to know are the commonly used tools and what they do. There is a lot of them and there are bunch of questions like “which tool would use for this?”. NMAP commands and syntax (very heavy in this), SQL Injection/XSS types and deciphering vulnerability logs. Make sure you have a semi decent grasp on SQL in general. ALL the different types of attacks that are commonly used. There are some that came up that I did not come across in the book. If you know the main/commonly used ones, you should be ok for the most part. Learn scripting! You will not need to write any per se, but you might as well learn because there are questions where you need to decipher/interpret various scripts and therefore need to know how to write them. Make sure you know the different syntax. For example, know how an array is written in PowerShell (there is a question in the exam where you will need to figure this out). Learn the common commands for PS, Bash and Linux. There was a couple questions having to do with common HTTP methods. There were not really any questions regarding the different laws. Definitely do not need to focus on that. You should know them anyways if you had just done the Managing Cloud class. The PBQs were medium difficulty. From what I remember, they were as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n1. Mix and match: You will get like a single line of script (or payloads rather) and you have to pick what kind of vulnerability it is and then you need to pick a method of remediation. Need to know your scripting and various types of SQL injection. This is critical. There will be like (10) of these you have to do.\\n\\n2. Scripting: On the right, there will be a block of incomplete scripting. On the left, you will have multiple options of code snippets that you will need to use to plug into the incomplete areas of the code. The code is prewritten for you. You just need to place the right snippet in the correct blank spot where the code is incomplete. There are twice as many code snippets then there are blank spots so you can’t just use the process of elimination. You kind of have to have some sort of clue. Also, the code might be in Bash, Python or Ruby. You have to be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n3. NMAP Interpretation: You will get a block of an NMAP scan result. Like above, you will have a bunch of options on the right hand side. You will be asked to put together the correct NMAP command to get the results shown in the scan output. Part 2 is that you will need to also pick the trouble areas (attack vectors) based on what the scan shows. There will be a list of options for you to choose from.\\n\\n4. Investigate Login Page: You will be given a login page of which you can view the certificate, source code and cookies. You will need to determine if any of those 3 things have issues. If they do, you will need to specify and provide a solution.\\n\\nThe Sybex book is by far the best book for this course. I did not care for the Sybex books in the other courses. Finding a good video series was difficult. I’m a total seminars fan, but this one did not do it for me. I hate the Dion materials in general and I’ve tried others on Udemy and Youtube and none of them were doing it for me. Another great book is Pentest+ for dummies. Very engaging. Lastly, you must spend time and do labs to understand the concepts. You’re really shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t. Look into tryhackmeDOTcom as well. I took the exam 3 days after registering for the class after a quick review. I thought I would be ok and I wanted to quickly get it over with. I found out in the first 10 questions and the PBQs that I was very underprepared. I took the test again a week later after intense studying and passed.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project – C769 (9 Days)**\\n\\nEh, it is what it is. A bunch of busy work. No need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look in WGUs database that has\\n\\nall the previous capstones that were rewarded for “excellence” and look at them for inspiration, ideas and see how they put theirs together. There is also a dedicated capstone page that will provide templates and samples for you so you will not be totally lost. I chose to propose implementing an “Insider Threat Management System” for a pharmaceutical company based on a scenario that I made up. There are 3 parts to the capstone: submitting what you will propose, writing the actual proposal and writing a post implementation report/reflection. None of it is difficult, it is just time consuming as they are asking for you to include a lot of stuff. 70% of part 3 is going to ask you for the same thing in part 2. I literally just cut and pasted the applicable sections from part 2 and changed the wording to past tense as part 3 is supposed to occur after you implemented your system. There will be a portion where you have to use outside references and cite books or whatever…just goto researchgateDOTcom query whatever subject you’re doing, pick however many you need from the search results that pertain and just read the abstracts and tie them into your proposal and cite them (already provided when you select a paper to view). This should save you some time. You are also going to need to turn in some sort of “deliverable” whether it be code sample, UML diagrams, operations manual, etc… I would suggest just doing a simple process diagram and explain each process. Its quick and easy and satisfies that requirement. If you goto apps dot diagrams dot net, you can build a nice one for free. If you want to be ultra creative and spend all your time doing the capstone on some crazy and innovative idea, all good. However, I would suggest you put in the bare minimum effort and move on, finish this program and get started on your new career asap. I WOULD NOT put any effort into this capstone! WGU doesn’t require it (they are just looking that you have all the things in their rubric). This project is not beneficial in any way and its not like you would be using it for a portfolio or anything. Do not waste your time on it. Read the requirements make sure you include those requirements and go.\\n\\n**List of exams from least difficult to most difficult:**\\n\\n1. A+ part 2\\n\\n2. A+ part 1\\n\\n3. SSCP\\n\\n4. Intro to Cryptography OA (Not difficult, but lots of memorization)\\n\\n5. Security+\\n\\n6. Managing Cloud Security OA (Due to amount of questions and material needed to go over)\\n\\n7. CYSA+\\n\\n8. Network+ (Information overload and acronyms galore!)\\n\\n9. Pentest+ (read review!)\\n\\n\\*I am awaiting to take the CCSP. I will be taking it in 2 weeks. I do not know how difficult it will be. Can’t be that hard. I’ll provide a writeup when I do take it\\*\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**2 things that may or may not help you…**\\n\\n1. There is a lot of information on the internet about how to study. Reading the text book through and through and taking notes is not efficient nor is it the best way and it is what is called “passive learning”. It is more efficient to do active learning. Which means…well…do active things when you’re learning…flash cards, practice exams, simulate teaching the material, physical home lab, etc…\\n\\nWhen it comes to studying especially for exams, my normal study habit is to watch a video series on 2x the speed or the fastest it can be where I can clearly understand it. You are trying to get an overview and have familiarity with everything. The video is visual and helps things stick. You’ll be surprised how much you can pick up. I will not take notes, just jot down questions of things I need to go over as they come up while I am watching. When Im done with the series, I will then look those question topics up and determine the what, why, and how of it to understand that particular topic/concept. Then I will generally do a practice exam, note question topics that I am not familiar with to look up when done. I will also go over the questions missed and then repeat then go over the same or another practice exam. It doesn’t matter if the test is not that similar in style/difficulty to what you are taking if you take the time to understand the concept. Comprehensive practice exams is my preference but anything that is “active” is good. You will figure out what works best for you. Just don’t read a book front to back, take notes in between and try to memorize it unless you like being inefficient and wasting your time…unless that is what is best for you. Lol\\n\\n2. Most of you already know this, but ChatGPT is your friend! By far the most valuable tool for me. It can be abused or it can be used as an extremely well-functioning learning tool. You are only hurting yourself if you want to try and use it for other purposes. When I would study my material and need to understand a topic like OSI models for example, I would write something like “Explain to me like a child what the OSI layers are and what they do. Also provide me an analogy.”. I cannot tell you how easy it was for me to pick things up when Chatgpt was able to explain things to me like im a 5 year old and provide me an easy to understand analogy. Analogies was a game changer for me. If you still don’t understand, you can have full conversations with it and ask it questions until you do understand it. Something like “I don’t understand, why would it do \\\\\\*this when it seems to do \\*that? You said \\*this. What is difference between \\*this and \\*that?”! Like full on conversations. Try it right now and see what I’m talking about! Use it to your advantage for learning. It is an amazing resource! Word of caution though, it is not always right depending on what you are asking or telling it what to do so when in doubt verify it.\\n\\n**My thoughts overall:**\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking: “ MmMMMmGoOoOo! BuT, bUt, BuT, YoU JuSt RuShEd ThRoUgH iT aNd DiD NoT LeArN AnyThInG! mMmGoOoOoOo!”. I learned the amount of material I needed to learn to get through the entire program and have probably come out with just as much as everyone else who graduated regardless of time spent. More than others in some cases. I also feel like I have a gotten a very solid foundation out of it, which was my expectation. \\n\\nHere is the thing, I would rather blow through the program and pay minimum tuition of $4k (plus get all my bonus certs!), continue learning and fill in gaps after completion at my leisure vs taking my sweet time and pump out the program in 3-4 terms and pay $12k-$16k. I guarantee I will have far surpassed that person’s knowledge on an intellectual and practical level by the time he/she is done. My learning will never stop, but my tuition will as soon as I can make it stop! Time is money. Massive acceleration is the way to go if it can be done…in my opinion. That is the beauty of WGU.\\n\\nThat being said, I feel like I’m just beginning, in that I’ve only dipped my toe and now the real learning begins. Now that I have the time and am not at the mercy of my term date lest I pay another 4k, I will go back and fill in my gaps and really start doing real world practical stuff and labs that I did not do. I did build a pretty intricate homelab that I will be using heavily. Anyways, I feel like this program did an excellent job in providing a solid foundation and I do mean excellent. I do not regret it in any way and I am in many ways more excited about this then I was with the Computer Science degree. That’s all I got. Good luck to you all! If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me.</td>\n",

Review of all classes.\\nThere are others that have made this post, but I think it would be helpful if people gave context to who they are and their level of proficiencies so that others can more accurately predict how the experience will go for them.\\n\\n  \\n**Who I am:**\\n\\n*  Early 30s male\\n* Wife and kid (toddler)\\n* Working full time while doing the degree in an unrelated field (High school AP physics teacher)\\n* No prior work experience in the tech field\\n* Did a Udemy course about 2 months before enrollment, which taught basic programming (Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python... and I did about 20 days of that and had never coded before)\\n* Have always had a strong interest in tech and computers as a USER. Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.

       "      <td>My Fun 41-Day MBA Journey - SO WORTH IT!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\*This is about my MBA journey, I hope to inspire, but don't be hard on yourself if your accelerated path is different\\*\\n\\nI was highly motivated and inspired by the post I read in this Reddit group from Sleyk2010, along with many other accelerators in this group and a few FB groups. Before I chose WGU for my MBA, I had my share of skepticism. I looked at numerous online and Brick and Mortar schools (I received my Bachelor’s from a traditional B&amp;M University). I completed my BSBM in a little over two years for a 5-year program (about 18 months ago), so I was already used to acceleration. I could have accelerated my Bachelor’s degree even more, but of course, I could only go as fast as the university allowed. I had to go the full 6 or 8 weeks for a course, even if I completed all of my exams, papers, and reading ahead of time. This led to me doubling and tripling my course load each semester. What drew me to WGU was that I CAN DICTATE MY PATH. I knew that I had a hunger for reading books, writing papers, and retaining the coursework. I am just maniacal like that, so I don’t expect everybody to feel the way I do about school. I knew I could crush my goals through acceleration because I know myself well enough and have been able to do it in the past. School is actually fun for me and if that makes me weird or crazy, I will proudly own that, lol.\\n\\nAll of this being said, everyone approaches school at their own individual pace and I am not writing this to declare that everybody will complete their Master’s degree in a matter of weeks or a few months. Everyone’s motivation is also not the same and how a person approaches school impacts how they set their pace. There is no way to “cheat” a degree. Everyone gets the SAME courses and the same coursework. Less than 10% of students accelerate at a pace where they can achieve their degree in well under one term/semester. The norm is that students will take two terms or more. Be clear that it IS TOTALLY OKAY. There is no “correct amount of time” to finish a degree. It is totally up to you based on your motivation, the time you dedicate to it, and your ability to absorb the coursework.  No matter how quickly you finish, be proud that you finished and that it took some hard work to get there.\\n\\nSo, let me get to the fun part. The Reddit and Facebook groups are helpful and great motivators for those who decide to come to WGU. It is a great school, properly accredited, and VERY reputable. WGU is also very relevant for the working adult and career-minded individuals who want to advance their careers. I am laying out a full course-by-course write-up of how I approached each course and how I successfully passed it. Let me be clear, this is how I did it and what worked for me, so by no means will this be a blanket approach that works for everyone. It is a lot of hard work and some frustrating days will be ahead, but trust me, obtaining your MBA is doable if you stay focused and put in the work. I don’t have any “tricks,” no rubrics, no papers to use for sampling, and no study guides to pass along. For the sake of academic integrity, I won’t risk myself or anyone putting a stain on the school or me for giving people the easy way out. If I had to do the work, so do you. I am offering some guidance and motivation for students in the program. Hopefully, acceleration will work well for you all too!!!!\\n\\nAgain, I don’t have any work to pass along, so please don’t inquire. If anyone feels the need to minimize and discredit accelerators, keep that negative energy somewhere because accelerators are the exception, not the norm, so this is NOT easy. As you will see many accelerators say, they will not apologize for busting their ass to obtain their degree faster than others. Some people are brainiacs, some are overachievers, and some are both. That is not a bad thing. Also, some Program Mentors are better than others and will be supportive of your path. My mentor was AWESOME and I came in with a game plan and strategy that she backed me up on. I made it clear that I was accelerating and would NOT be in the program longer than 45 days because I am on a mission. I am maniacal in my approach and putting in 40 hours or more a week outside of work to do schoolwork is not a problem for me. I can rest when I finish my degree. I do not suggest this for everyone. Plus, I have an empty nest with all my adult children out on their own. I had some downtime at work and figured no time was better than the present to get my MBA and advance my career. I will start with the Three Commandments of WGU, which I will cite as a source courtesy of SLEYK2010 himself (which are great by the way!!)\\n\\n*“The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.”*\\n\\n***To add as an addendum to the commandments, use Grammarly or some type of paper editing application for your papers. They will eliminate grammar and spelling errors on all of your papers. It is your best friend. Also, use Quizlet, they have very useful study guides to use for the courses.***\\n\\n**\\*Disclaimer\\* This is not the order I TOOK the courses in, they are in numerical order. My game plan was to do all of the PA (writing courses) first and switch my brain over to the analytical courses next (ones with OAs). I did C213 and C214 Back-toBack because there was a lot of cross-over between the two courses. I  saved C215 and C207 for last because of the cross-over and because I wanted to close out with the OA and PA course (C207).**\\n\\n**On to the courses!!!**\\n\\n**ORA1** – **Orientation** – One PA\\n\\nDo what you feel is best for the orientation. If you have done a lot of research on the academic program before orientation opens up, this “course” won’t be tedious. Follow the rubric, keep it simple, and peruse the “coursework.” It simply gives an overview of what to expect as a student and ensures that you are prepared to start your program. Be as realistic as you can be when asked about how much of a time commitment you can truly make each week to your schoolwork.\\n\\n**C200** – **Managing Organizations and Leading People** \\- Two OAs (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nYou will start with what is called the “Signature Themes Assessment.” It does not take hella long to do and when you complete it, save the PDF. Task #1 is a paper centered around the assessment that you took. PLEASE FOLLOW THE RUBRIC when you write the paper. Task #2 focuses on leadership that you experienced in your career. It can be a past or present company. You won’t be able to use actual names for the company or the person (or people) that you write about. Have fun with it, the assignment will be about your life experiences, so it will be easy to speak to either way. I finished both papers in one day, I just got diarrhea of the brain and my hands did the rest. This is one course where I will say that even though there is some reading that is available, it won’t be of much use. The readings are pretty much common sense type of stuff and won’t make much of an impact on the papers that you have to write in this course. Just get straight to writing and have fun with it.\\n\\n**C202** – **Managing Human Capital** – One OA (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nThis class was pretty straightforward in my eyes. I assume we are all adults here and have been a part of a workplace environment that involved employee interaction. A lot of common sense and work experience type of content is in this course. The technical aspects of this course (terminology and concepts) are in the reading materials and there is a Quizlet (get acquainted with this site, it is VERY helpful) that is very helpful for the course. I did some of the reading, but a lot of it was stuff I covered extensively in undergrad, so I didn’t have to deep dive into the reading materials. This is the Human Resources course of the MBA program. I took the pre-assessment and reviewed my weak areas. I skimmed the readings and reviewed a few Quizlets to help me prepare for the OA. It took me about two days total to do the reading, study, and pass the OA. Again, the course is not a beast, you will know more about the course than you will think. Some people may take longer to get through the course and trust me, THAT IS OKAY.\\n\\n**C204** – **Management Communication** – Three PAs -Two Papers and One PPT&amp;Video (Another Straightforward and Easy Course) \\n\\nThis course was actually a lot of fun. Tedious, but easy enough. There are some reading materials for this course, but honestly, they don’t provide much help for the actual tasks. I skimmed the materials to see what use I could make of them, but I was able to dive right into the tasks. Task #1 is a paper, but it will be constructed in a weird manner. The course is about professional communication in the workplace. You will be writing emails from the perspective of being a business owner or a supervisor. You will be writing emails to your staff, a business partner, and the stakeholders. The three emails will be fun to make, so don’t overthink the assignment.  Task #2 is a Powerpoint and Video. WGU uses Panopto for video creation. If you have never used it before (most of us probably have not), they provide instructional videos on how to use it. You should have access to Panopto as a student, but if you don’t, reach out to the IT department, and they will rectify that for you pretty quickly, usually within 24 hours. The video only needs to cover the points in the rubric and your PPT should be an outline of the presentation. Mine took over 15 minutes, but I am a classroom trainer by trade, so it was in my wheelhouse. Most people can truly do their presentation in less than 10 minutes. Follow the rubric to ensure you cover all the points they want you to cover and you will be fine. Task 3 is an executive summary. A one-page paper and you are good to go. All three tasks can be done by jumping in head first while the reading materials provide just a little help for the papers. I was able to complete all three tasks over two days.\\n\\n**C206** – **Ethical Leadership** – Three PAs (Straightforward but VERY tedious course)\\n\\nI did not personally find this class to be “hard,” but it is very labor-intensive. This course is similar to C200 in that you will be using another assessment called the “Ethical Lens Inventory” to start you off before your first task. There are 3 PAs and they are a doozy, lol. I honestly had fun with this class because I had a few ethics courses in undergrad and had to apply them in real life at work. The reading materials are enlightening and helpful but don’t be intimidated by any of the reading. A lot of the reading is stuff you have previously or currently face in your workplace and your life. I had a LOT of ammo to use for these papers, so the writing was pretty easy for me. Task #1 is to write about a leader you admire, a leader you know, or a famous leader. It does not matter; just make sure you cite any sources if you use someone you don’t know personally. Task #2 is focused on social responsibility, ethics in the workplace, and ethical leaders. You may find that your work experiences will be very useful for this paper. Life experiences can be the best teacher. Task 3 is a paper about leadership and the code of ethics. All three tasks will include life experiences and ethics concepts, so the reading materials are helpful. PLEASE make sure you follow the rubric to the letter for each task because it can be easy to miss a section and have your paper sent back for revision. I spent one day reading the materials a bit and two days doing the papers. Three days total. I wrote over 15 pages for each task, but trust me, many of you can do them in 10 pages, give or take a page. I do like to write, so I tend to write with extensive details, but if you like to keep things simple and just answer each section in a rubric, DO THAT. Writing a novel is not necessary, lol. I did get two excellence awards for 2 of the tasks I wrote for this course, so the long ass days of writing were worth it for me.   \\n\\n**C207** – **Data-Driven Decision Making** \\- Two PAs and One OA (Hard course for most, not very straightforward)\\n\\nIf any of you have read up on this class on Reddit or Facebook, you will see that this class beats people up. I can understand why it does. This is the Statistics class of the program. No real reading materials are provided for this course, which is why I say it is not so straightforward. There are TONS of PPTs and videos from the course instructors for this course. USE THEM. I personally love statistics and data, so I didn’t feel intimidated by the class. There is not a lot of math used in this course, it is heavy on concepts and statistical methods. Again, there are tons of resources in the course from the CIs, such as videos, study guides, and PPTs. Review them multiple times if you have to until you start to comprehend the material. Reach out to a CI if you need assistance, they are there to help. Quizlet is also helpful for the OA in this course because you will be using a lot of terminology. For task #1, you are forming a hypothesis that you will have to analyze for task #2. Once the evaluators approve task #1, you can move to task #2. The course will provide the framework for all the statistical methods you can use for your hypothesis. Most people chose a T-Test or ANOVA. I chose linear regression. I only chose it because it made more sense for my hypothesis. Use a topic you are familiar with for your hypothesis, it will make the task less painful. I used home values and mortgage rates because I work in the financial world, but I easily could have used sports for a topic too. For task #2, they provide videos and PPTs for each test that you perform and will show you how to input them in Excel. You will need at least 30 data points to use for the assignment but trust me, once you gather the info, it gets easier from there. Once you run the analysis in Excel, you will be writing a short paper (probably no more than 5 or 6 pages) that covers about 6 or 7 bullet points. As always, follow the rubric and keep it simple. For the OA, they provide a pretty good study guide and flashcards for the terminology, but Quizlet is an excellent supplement for this as well. The pre-assessment does not align heavily with the OA, but use it as a starting point for the areas that you do need to cover for the OA. My Program Mentor let me push this class to the end before the Capstone because I wanted to follow the Operations Management course (there is a lot of crossover between the courses). I honestly had fun with this class because I love Stats and Math (I am a math tutor on the side), so I didn’t lose my mind in the course. It took me about five days to read and watch the course materials, do the tasks, study, and pass the OA. Realistically, this course can easily take many weeks for people to complete and that is okay. It is not easy for most and you truly want to comprehend and retain what you learn in the course. \\n\\n**C211** – **Global Economics for Managers** – One PA (Somewhat hard course for most)\\n\\nMany people have stated this course kicked their butt and I can see why. There is a lot of technical stuff to cover in this course and if you are not a fan of economics or did not cover it much in undergrad, this class will be brutal. For me, I like this type of stuff and still use a lot of the micro and macro Econ knowledge I learned in undergrad, especially being in the financial industry. There are reading materials, study guides, videos, and PPTs available for this course and they are very helpful materials to use. Focus on the areas where you are the weakest because you don’t want to be in the dark in important areas that you don’t know. There are a lot of terms and concepts that you need to know and the study guides are very helpful in covering what you need to know. Use Quizlet too, it supplements the course material tremendously. There are helpful YouTube videos for Econ as well, so just know that there are many ways to skin a cat here to find helpful information. The pre-assessment somewhat aligns with the OA, so spot your weak areas and drill those down before the OA. I felt the class was not hard for me because of what I came into the class with, but I know that this class can be a lot of work for many. It is not a race; take as much time as you need to understand the course. It took me about three days to complete the course, but just try to get as much as you can out of the course and do it at your pace.   \\n\\n**C212** – **Marketing** – One HUGE PA (Straightforward and somewhat easy course)\\n\\nThis course was easy in terms of understanding the materials but the final paper is long as hell. You really have to APPLY what you learn in the course. I still remembered many marketing concepts from my Bachelor’s program, so I didn’t have to spend far too much time in the book. The concepts are easy to understand and there is no test, so just dig around a little bit in the reading materials for information that you need. There is no way to sugarcoat this, the paper is very long. It will likely be the longest individual paper you write in the program. With that being said, try to have fun with the paper. Many of the areas you have to cover on the rubric are based on your opinion of what you would do if you made marketing decisions for a business. Some of the technical stuff is in the readings, but a good portion of the paper is based on what you would do to market a business. My paper was about 20 pages, but I didn’t feel it was brutal. All in, I completed the course in 2 days. The writing was a lot, but not painful. \\n\\n**C213** \\- **Accounting for Decision Makers** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most, but reasonable)\\n\\nThis course is very technical and if you aren’t familiar with accounting, it may beat you up a little bit. However, if you have any accounting knowledge from your bachelor’s programs, this course will not feel so brutal. Being the nerdy dork that I am, I think accounting is fun. I still retained a lot of what I learned from undergrad and apply it in real life because I do my own accounting for my side business. I still got a lot out of the class and brushed up on concepts that I had learned before, so the class was not hard for me. With all of this being said, there are reading materials (especially the Hawaiian shirt guy who had a video at the end of each chapter) and a few other videos and study guides in the course. The materials are very helpful, trust me. YouTube even has a few basic accounting videos (just like YouTube has for Economics) that are useful. Whatever you do, just make sure you find materials that help you understand accounting concepts effectively. There is a lot of technical work to nail down for the OA and you will want to know and understand basic accounting concepts. There is hardly any math on the OA, and the minimal math used is not hard. Know your debits and credits, the accounting formula, and understand accrual accounting. Quizlet is also a useful tool to supplement the course materials. The course only took me two days to complete and pass the OA, but that is because I already knew the material and could grasp the new stuff. This is a course you may find will be useful in the future, so try to get something out of the class, no matter if it takes you weeks to get through it. Use the CIs if you are struggling because some of the concepts may initially feel foreign.\\n\\n**C214** – **Financial Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most)\\n\\nI won’t sugar coat it, this course is not as fun for me as the rest, lol. I don’t mind finance as a whole, it is just sooooo tedious. If you don’t have a finance calculator (I have had one for many years), make sure you get one. The preferable calculator to use is the TI-30 BAII. If you use any other kind of calculator, you are asking for your life to be filled with agony. Learn the basic functions of the calculator. The course provides a good video on how to use it as well as YouTube. However you do it, just make sure you know how to use the bloody thing. The great thing about this course is that the pre-assessment and the OA will provide all of the formulas that you need to use. You don’t have to remember the formulas, but you do need to know how to apply them and plug them into the calculator. This PA has much more math than the OA, so you will want to focus more on the concepts of Finance and how they apply to the real world. This course has some VERY helpful study guides, PPTs, and videos from the CIs. Quizlets are also very useful. Watch those darn videos 100 times if you have to until it sticks. You will not want to skate through this course, many people fail the OA, and many fail more than once. You can’t BS through this course, you will need to use the materials to grasp the concepts and enlist the help of a CI if you truly get stuck. The math part of the class was the easy part for me, I spent more time focusing on the application of finance principles and that was very fulfilling. I was able to learn things that I did not cover in my finance course in undergrad. I completed the course and passed the OA in a total of 4 days, but I came in with a pretty good foundation that really helped me retain the stuff I learned in the course. Remember, GO AT YOUR PACE. Once you feel confident about the materials, take that OA and put it behind you. \\n\\n**C215** – **Operations Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard Course)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I like this course the least, lol. The main reason is that I was not as passionate about the material. With that being said, I got the most out of this course. I learned a hell of a lot. There is quite a bit of cross-over with C207 because the manufacturing industry utilizes a lot of statistical methods (like Six Sigma, Lean, etc.).  I studied my ass off in this class and completing it was the most fulfilling. The reading materials are helpful, but they are dense and probably more dry than most of the reading. The study guides in the course from the CIs, Quizlet, and some of the reading from the book got me through the class. It is honestly that simple. The materials are there, they are straightforward, they apply to the OA, and they are tools to help you succeed in the course. It took about five days to learn the materials, study, and pass the OA. This course tends to stop people in their tracks and they drag through this class for over a month or more. Don’t be scared of the course. Dive in, learn the material, and don’t stop and start the course to drag it out. That is how you lose your momentum and the course ends up feeling sluggish. Operations Management will be very good material to retain and for people in factories or other manufacturing fields, you will be very comfortable with the coursework. I will also add that this course is one of the most important courses to use as a foundation for the Capstone.\\n\\n**C216** – **MBA Capstone** – Three PAs - PPT &amp; Video, One Huge Paper, and 3-part final task (Very Tedious Course but soooooo much fun)\\n\\nWoohoo!!!!! You made it to the end!!!! You will now apply all the valuable teachings from your other courses and roll them all into the Capstone. The Capstone is centered around a Marketplace Business Simulation. You will be the owner and decision-maker of a business and have six total quarters to make sound business decisions and get a simulation score of at least 0.001 or higher. If you fail, you have the take the simulation all over again. Trust me, you do not want to be set back because of that. Before you do the simulation, it wouldn’t hurt to read the Conscious Capitalism articles they provide. There is no book for the course, just the articles. The CIs provide videos on how to do each task and they may be helpful for each of you to use when figuring out how to structure your presentation and paper. Now, on to the Simulation. You are going to do the simulation for three quarters and pause. You will assess your business and review your decisions so far (you cannot go back and change them once you submit the quarter). Do all of Quarter 4, but do NOT submit it (or else you will make your life hell and screw up the simulation for yourself). Once you complete (but not submit) Quarter 4, it is time to do the PPT and video presentation for task #1. You are a business owner and should act as such, so wear some business casual clothes for your Panopto presentation. You are giving an update of the business through Q4 and telling stakeholders your business plan while asking for more money to invest for the next few quarters. Don’t stress over the PPT, the course provides a template for the presentation PPT and you just have to fill in the relevant information from your business. Most people can do their presentation in 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes. Mine was 40 minutes, but that is because I live for classroom teaching and presentations. It is fun and I definitely overdid it. Once you complete Task #1 and submit it, NOW you can go in and submit Quarter 4. You have to submit task #1 before you do that so the evaluators can go in and open the final two quarters. Now you will work on completing Quarters 5 and 6. My best advice is to be a conscious business. Your decisions should be centered around that because that is what this is all about, right? You can get a jump on task #3 while you wait for task #1 to be reviewed. Task #3 is a reflection paper on what you have learned in the MBA program, make a S.M.A.R.T. goal, how it will be used for your future career path, and include “career and education artifacts.” You will also submit your LinkedIn profile. The rubric will break it all down for you. You can easily complete task #3 in a few hours with the paper and the gathering of your artifacts. Beware though, you CAN NOT submit task #3 until you have completed AND submitted task #2. Just keep it on ice until you submit task #2 and submit task #3 a minute later.  Once you complete all six quarters, you will review your business results in Quarter 7. From this point, you will gather everything you need for the final paper in task #2. Task #2 will be long (mine was 20 pages), but there will be screenshots of graphs and other charts included, so it will not be 100% written words, lol. Follow the trusty rubric and just rock out that last huge paper. You ran the business and made all the decisions, so you will have all of the intimate details of the simulation and will be the best person to speak on it, so own it and tell your story! Whew! Submit task #2, then submit task #3 and wait for the last evaluations of the MBA program.   The Capstone took me about nine days.\\n\\nThe MBA program took me 41 days, but I feel if I didn’t have to go out of town a few times, give myself a couple of days of rest, and not lose a day to revise a task (Task #3 of the Capstone, my silly self did not upload one of my artifacts), I would have completed it in less than 30. I will still take it though and I am very proud that I still crushed my goal.\\n\\nOnce everything is graded and you get confirmation that your final task passed, you can now scream to the world….. YOU ARE AN MBA GRAD!!!!!! \\n\\nSoak in the moment, celebrate your achievement, thank your mentor(who will submit you for graduation), thank your family and friends who have been in your corner, and pat yourself on the back for what you accomplished. Then, wait about 7-10 days for the WGU Owl and Confetti to appear on your WGU profile page, which will officially confirm you are a grad and can no longer access your courses. The road is not easy and some may take longer to get to the finish line than others, but once you finish, you are a winner. No one will be able to take it away from you!!!\\n\\nGO OWLS!!! Remember, you can do it with effort and motivation too :-)\\n\\nON TO THE MSML WHEN MY NEXT TERM BEGINS!!!!!!!</td>\n",

I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and I've been here since the summer of 2023. I'm a 22y/o based out of the east coast (US). WGU changed my life. In this post I'm going to share my story and the result of 18 months of hard work! I'm also going to provide you guys with the best tips and pieces of information I've gathered from countless hours of researching the job market, reading r/resumes and other related subreddits, news articles, interviews, etc. I'm making this post as a way of reflecting on the past 2 years of my life and to give back to the community by sharing information &amp; my story. My DMs are open for anybody who has questions or would just like to chat!\\n\\n**Background**  \\nI was working as a security guard before WGU and I had a lot of free-time at work to spend on my laptop. I knew I wanted a degree but couldn't afford the tuition and didn't like the idea of graduating much later than my friends I went to HS with. WGU offered me a solution to both of these problems, and I was able to complete a LOT of school work during work hours (I had explicit permission from my manager). This was an amazing opportunity for me because I still lived at home with my parents and was being paid between $17-20/hr to complete school work. If this sounds like something that interests you, I encourage you to apply to Securitas, Allied Universal, GardaWorld, or Prosegur. Look for \"warm body\" sites- locations where you're paid to just sit at a desk in an empty building. Overnight and weekend jobs are great for this sort of thing as well. A good resource for getting into the security industry is r/securityguards. You won't need to carry a firearm if that's a concern of yours. Also, be advised, some states require you to have a security guard license. Personally I didn't have to.\\n\\nI knew I wanted to study IT so choosing which degree program to enroll in wasn't difficult for me. I chose to do the accelerated BSIT-&gt;MSITM program and had a clear idea in mind of the career path I wanted to take. I cannot overstate the importance of doing research on career trajectories from different degrees. The [WGU website](https://www.wgu.edu/) does a decent job of providing degree and career information from whichever degree you choose, but the WGU website alone is simply not enough. Interview/talk with people in the field you're interested in, possibly shadow them, start projects of your own- it is entirely your responsibility to create a plan going into this. Changing your degree program later down the road is completely acceptable but do understand the consequences associated with that (time, money, etc). On a separate note, it's a good idea to organize your school materials and whatnot prior to starting. I created a free [Notion](http://www.notion.com) to keep track of my schedule, save informative Reddit posts and other course materials, track my progress, create reminders, store documents, etc. Another benefit of learning Notion and using it was that I was able to put this tool on my resume.\\n\\n**Pre-WGU**  \\nI took as many courses on [Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) that I possibly could, prior to officially enrolling. I'm not entirely sure if things are the same with Sophia nowadays but when I did it, all of the courses/tests were unproctored and open-book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you do Sophia courses. I didn't do [SDC](https://study.com/) and personally I don't recommend it because their courses can take a while. [This resource](https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines) outlines what you can transfer in, for each WGU degree. I also transferred in the CompTIA A+, N+, S+ (these three certifications together are commonly referred to as the trifecta), because I already had them. WGU will pay for attempts for certifications if they are *required* for your degree program. I used to have a good transfer guide saved but I'm not sure what happened to it; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1390mx6/bsit_im_still_waiting_on_my_transfer_eval_of_my/) might be a helpful resource as well. Also, before you officially enroll, make sure to buy a webcam for the OAs. I use the Webcam 1000 which is what WGU recommends. It plugs into my laptop and works great. I've heard of other people buying one that has a tripod, so do some research and get whichever is best for you. Despite the scary proctoring stories you might read on this subreddit, I've never had any bad experiences myself. YMMV\\n\\nYou get assigned a Program Mentor before your start date. Mine has been extremely helpful and respectful of my preferred communication style and needs. I have seen reddit posts where people complain about their mentors- them wanting to schedule too many meetings, not opening classes, etc. This might be a good [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/16ybsoq/can_i_request_to_change_my_mentor_what_is_your/).\\n\\n**WGU**  \\nMy start date was October 1, 2023. I was able to complete 13 courses in my first term (a term is a 6 month period). I definitely recommend looking up the course code in this subreddit (ex: C268) to find resources. Here is some helpful information about the courses that stand out to me:\\n\\nC268 - This was the 4th class I had, and the real first challenge for me. I think it's like a meme in the WGU-IT community that we've all used [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pf6syi/c268_spreadsheets_video/) to help us pass. &lt;15hrs of studying.\\n\\nC962 - This class was the most amount of writing I've had to do in my undergrad. You'll enjoy this class if you like reading, researching, and finding a great quote to support your writing. I think I wrote my paper about AI or wearable technology or something. This class was &lt;25 hrs of work.\\n\\nC773 - I enjoyed this class a lot. This is an [exceptional resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1f12w4e/summary_user_interface_design_c773_passed_in_6/)\\n\\nD333 - I passed this exemplary on my first attempt but a lot of people have trouble with this class. I think that most of the names of the laws you have to memorize are self-explanatory. [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1d2f20e/d333_finished_in_3_days_passed_first_try_heres_how/)reddit post helped me formulate a strategy for studying for the exam, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/zhy5l8/d333_ethics_in_technology_updated_class_version/) post provides a lot of good learning material.\\n\\nThe CompTIA trifecta can be studied through [free courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/tcqdwh/guys_please_remember_that_wgu_gives_you_a_lot_of/) through udemy (all WGU students get a free udemy account). FWIW, I quit my security guard job around this time because I was offered an unpaid internship at my friend's dad's company. I'll talk more about this later.\\n\\nMy second term was from April 1 - Sept 30, and I was able to complete 3 courses (10 CUs):\\n\\nC954 - I spent a week straight in the library studying for this. Imo, this class is on par with the CompTIA A+ in terms of just how much course material there is. [This](https://onlinedegreeblog.com/wgu-c954-information-technology-management/) is a FANTASTIC read for those interested. Personally I loved this class because I felt like it tied everything together and gave me PRACTICAL insight into how companies (and specifically their IT department) function. If you're interested in additional learning opportunities beyond WGU, definitely look into Hubspot. It's a very popular CRM (well, it's more than just a CRM) that a lot of employers care about.\\n\\nC783 - I actually have weird circumstances regarding this class. I *forgot* to submit my CAPM certification prior to my start date. I reached out to my mentor and Student Support Services for help. My Mentor was able to fill out a form or something... and well, WGU made an exception for me. WGU makes it clear that they don't accept transfer credit after matriculation but they did for me, just this once. As a result, my program changed a little bit. I believe the BSIT is normally 122 credits but mine was changed to 138. Because I had passed the CAPM, the additional credits came from other courses, outside of my BSIT program, that were marked as Passed simply because me having the CAPM qualified me as having passed those courses. I never took the WGU OA for this class.\\n\\nI definitely slowed down in my 2nd/3rd terms and honestly I slacked off a lot. I was able to pull myself together and finish despite a lack of motivation. My third term was scheduled to end on the end of March (this month).\\n\\nC769 - My capstone project took me 2 weeks. Mine was about improving the security posture of a fictitious company. I really enjoyed working on this. If you're reading this and are about to start/currently working on your capstone, congrats on making it this far! I had a fun time using resources from my previous classes to work on this. I took this class more seriously than some of the others because I wanted my work to be a reflection of everything I've learnt at WGU.\\n\\nC777 - The dreaded Web Dev Applications. I took the Sophia course that is supposed to provide a foundation for this course so I didn't start with much knowledge. I procrastinated for weeks lol. PLEASE read the Study Guide. [This](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI) is a link to the study guide but I'm not sure if that link works, so please also refer to the 21day challenge document, sent in an email by your course instructor. I also watched the TraversyMedia HTML+CSS video a couple times and followed along with him. He will have you download SublimeTxt which is good, but I chose to use Visual Studio Code. The C777 study guide is your best friend. You're ready for the OA if you can score 90%+ on the practice OA, and if you feel comfortable creating a website. Another thing: some people may disagree with this, but for the purpose of passing your OA, try to not teach yourself additional information that isn't covered in the class. It can be a lot of information, try not to overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nD247 - I hated this class. This was my absolute worst class, and I just hated every second of it. My course instructor was amazing and I absolutely recommend that you review the powerpoints they've created- it's what helped me pass! The powerpoints will most likely be emailed to you. If not, please ask for them. One small mistake will flag your entire answer wrong for OA questions where you have to write code.\\n\\n**Graduation and my Personal Success Story**  \\nI applied for graduation on March 3rd and officially graduated on the 11th. I was emailed a link to download my WGU transcripts the next day, and was emailed a digital copy of my Diploma today (the 18th). I'm still waiting for my physical diploma and [regalia](https://www.buildagrad.com/wgu) to arrive. I'll be attending the Vegas commencement in April, hope to see you all there!!!! Maybe we can get a big groupchat together for people going! :)\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, I was offered an internship at my friend's dad's IT company. It was very informal and honestly a little disappointing but I was grateful for the opportunity to observe their work and go with them to meet with clients. I stayed with them for about 3 months or so and then decided to take a break to focus on my last two classes. Part of me regretted leaving my security job but I also didn't want to continue working there either. In the end, it worked out for me because I was able to put that \"internship\" on my resume and I figured that it looks better than no internship.\\n\\nI started to apply for jobs the moment I submitted my graduation application, which is what I recommend to everyone (if not sooner). However, it wasn't until after I graduated when I found the job posting for the job I got an offer for. I graduated on 3/11- on 3/12 I applied to this IT support technician job. I reached out to the recruiter (guide on that below) and we instantly connected. She helped me secure a screener interview (through Zoom) with the company later that week. I passed the screener interview and we set up an in-person interview yesterday. Honestly, I bombed the technical questions. I got destroyed in front of the CEO. I think I got the position because I spoke confidently and was transparent about my knowledge gaps. I arrived in a freshly dry-cleaned suit with 3 copies of my resume, and I took notes during the interview on my black leather padfolio (please buy one of these!). Every time they asked me a technical question I didn't know the answer to, I wrote it down, and said I'd research the answer. Also- before my interview- I wrote down questions I had for them, in my padfolio.\\n\\nThe job I was offered is a hybrid position and I couldn't be happier!!!! In 1.5 years I went from a security guard making 17/hr to making TC\\~60k in an MCOL, and I still live w my parents so no rent. Never, absolutely *never* doubt yourself.\\n\\nBelow are some tips I have for Resumes, Cover Letters, Applying, and Interviews. :)\\n\\n**Resume and Cover Letter Tips**  \\nYou already know that your resume (and cover letter) is extremely important, so I'm going to talk about how you can improve. Resume formats and the amount of creativity you can have really depends on the industry, so please don't interpret this as an end-all-be-all guide. This is more so for tech. Bluntly, you should have a pretty straightforward and easy-to-read resume.\\n\\n* Your resume should be 1 page unless you have 10-15+ years of experience. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jeg5ks/4_yoe_unemployed_tech_field_united_states/) is similar to what I use for mine (Idk why it's so zoomed in). Also please don't use a two-column layout.\\n* Your resume should be in an ATS-readable font such as Arial or Times New Roman (I use TNR for mine) and size 11 or 12.\\n* I suggest that you keep your resume in black and white. Don't use icons, shapes, or emojis. Far too often I see resumes with a little phone icon or something next to their phone number. These icons/shapes/emojis can look nice but they can also mess with the ATS (applicant tracking system) scanners, and also take the readers attention away from important details as they can be very eye-catching.\\n* Aim to fill the entire page. If you don't have enough experience or whatever that's completely fine, but there are ways to mitigate that. For instance you should use 12px size font, maybe expand upon your PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY section, make the size of your headings a little bigger, etc. You could also put a Relevant Coursework section in your Resume and name your WGU classes (don't include the course code \"C268\", just the name). This is what I did. During an interview, the hiring manager asked me about one of my classes!\\n* Your name/contact info section should contain your Firstname Lastname, phone number (xxx) xxx-xxxx, email (make sure your email sounds professional. Your professional email shouldn't be \"[gamerboy1206@gmail.com](mailto:gamerboy1206@gmail.com)\", it should be your name), a link to your Linkedin profile, and then city, State. Never put your exact address on your resume. That's a security concern and they don't need your address anyways, or at least until you get a job offer.\\n* Please, Please trim your Linkedin handle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNDY2KnXBw) for a guide on how to do that. Ensure your trimmed Linkedin handle is then put at the top of your resume\\n* If you have experience that isn't relevant to what you're applying for, put it on your resume anyways! Especially if you were there for a long time or if you really gained skills/experience.\\n* The bullet points under your jobs should NOT be pure fluff words. Instead, write meaningful statistics and hard facts.\\n   * \"Increased operational efficiency\" means nothing. Instead, you can put \"Achieved X through Y which resulted in Z\"\\n   * One of the bullet points in my resume is \"Efficiently handled over 100+ monthly calls, including inquiries, service calls, incident reports, technical support, and emergency responses.\" This bullet point includes an actual statistic, \"100+\", in a timeframe \"monthly\", and I specified the different types of regular issues I dealt with. Truthfully, I could have been more specific on \"technical support\", but I got the message across that I handled a variety of different inquiries. My intention there was to showcase my diverse skillset- again, there is always room to improve!\\n* WGU actually offers classes on Resume building, and will review your resume for free. You can find information to that [here](https://careers.wgu.edu/channels/resumes/). I did this, and the results were amazing! The more people you can get to look over your resume, the better.\\n* !! This one is very important. The end result of your resume should be a PDF. I've always used Google Docs online to create my resume. It allows me to convert it into a PDF with two clicks of my mouse. When you download your PDF, PLEASE rename it to \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_Resume\", instead of just \"Resume\". This will make it 1000x easier for hiring managers to see your resume and know it's from you. A lot of people name their resume just \"Resume\"... you need to stand out, and that's how you do it!\\n\\nIn addition to a resume, you should also make a cover letter template. Meaning, for every new cover letter you create, you change the name of the job title and company (written in the CL) to match the job you're applying for.\\n\\n* If you choose to make two templates, here is what I recommend you do: the first template should be called \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_CoverLetter\\_CompanyName\" and also \"FirstName.Lastname.CoverLetter.CompanyName\". That way, there is a slight difference between the two (that only you know of) and it still looks professional. For instance, lets say you want to apply to Helpdesk roles and Project Coordinator roles. The Helpdesk cover letter template could be the one with the periods, whereas the Project Coordinator cover letter templates could be the one with the underscores. Again, this is a very subtle way for you to distinguish between the two, so you can have a more personalized cover letter for the jobs you're applying to. This is actually what I do personally.\\n   * For example, my Project Coordinator cover letter is more geared towards PM/Project coordinator positions. It mentions my CAPM cert\\n* Your Cover letter should contain the same name and contact info as your resume. Same email, phone number, city, etc.\\n* Your CL (ideally) should be the same font and font size as your resume. I don't think this is necessarily required but the attention-to-detail can go a long way. I like the uniformity of doing it this way.\\n* As a general rule of thumb: the first paragraph (3-4 sentences) should explain who you are, the body paragraph should talk about your experiences, qualifications, why you want the position, and why you're a good fit, and the closing paragraph (2-3 sentences) should reaffirm your interest, express gratitude, and indicate your eagerness to discuss this opportunity/interview.\\n\\n**My 'Guide-to-Apply'**  \\nIt's vey rare that I'll hear back from an application submitted thru Indeed. LinkedIn is my preferred way to apply. I have LinkedIn premium (I highly suggest you try the $0 down *free trial*). I swear, it's what helped me get this job. If you get contacted about scheduling an interview, your next steps should be to research the company ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is an amazingggg tool for this).\\n\\n* Look up for tech job openings near you. Most of IT (and some CS) start out in job titles such as Helpdesk, Support I, jr IT specialist, IT technician, stuff of that nature. That's what you should be looking for. Don't expect to go right into cybersecurity lol. The reality is that cybersecurity is mid-level and senior-level.\\n* Have realistic salary expectations. A huge factor is where you live (understand the terms LCOL, MCOL, HCOL). But I think that a very general rule of thumb is that out of college you can reasonably expect between 40-65k for an entry level IT job, with the national avg being about 51k ish.\\n* GET A PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT TAKEN FOR YOUR LINKEDIN. Have your hair nice, shave your face or freshen up your facial hair, wear a fresh outfit, have a SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND, and just be presentable. You should want to look your best. [This is interesting:](https://www.earth.com/news/attractive-people-have-more-career-opportunities-and-success/)\\n   * DON'T put your headshot (or any pictures) on your resume. This might be a norm in other cultures but definitely not for tech jobs in the US\\n* Go on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and get a nice background for your linkedin. Doesn't have to have any text, could even just be a solid color with a gentle gradiant. Anything is (usually) better than the default background. Mine is just a blue background with some lines on it, it looks like waves. It's just an artistic thing. But I made sure that the tie I'm wearing in my profile picture is the same shade of blue as my background. I think it ties it together nicely.\\n* Reach out to a recruiter. I wouldn't have gotten this job opportunity without my recruiter's help. In my opinion, a good recruiter might feel like a 'temporary career coach'. My recruiter gave me advice, gave me constant updates, insight, etc. She was amazing. This is the message I sent her to initiate our first conversation:\\n   * Hi,  I hope you're doing well! I came across the *JobName* position at *CompanyName* and am very interested. I’d love to learn more about the key qualities and skills you’re looking for in applicants. Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to send my resume if that would be helpful.  Looking forward to your reply!  Best, *FullName*\\n* Monitor your email regularly. People don't like to be kept waiting, especially when companies may be interviewing potentially hundreds of other applicants.\\n\\n**Interviews**  \\nOne of the best resources for interviews (and resumes too) I've ever come across is chief.analyst on tiktok.  Even though he's in an entirely different industry (finance), I love his advice and how articulate he is. Being able to speak confidently and clearly is a non-negotiable. Never underestimate the importance of good communication- it's what helped me get this job after not being able to answer a single technical question correctly despite being up against over 160 other applicants.\\n\\nIt's typical for you to go through a virtual interview before being invited to an in-person interview. This is called a screener and as the name suggests, it's for screening out candidates who don't meet the qualifications necessary or those who appear to be unenthusiastic. Showing enthusiasm and positive energy is incredibly important- you can show this by asking questions, smiling, and knowing what the company does.\\n\\n* I mentioned this earlier in my Graduation section but invest in a padfolio. I think I got mine for $12 from Target. It should carry 3 copies of your resume (anything more is excessive) business cards if you have them (I personally did not), a pen (ensure that it works and isn't out of ink!), and paper for notes. You don't need your padfolio for a virtual interview- instead, I'd recommend you have your full attention on the interviewer. It helps to look directly at the camera (instead of your screen) so it gives the illusion you're looking directly at the interviewer, from their end.\\n* In my padfolio, I also wrote down questions I wanted to ask the interviewers, the night prior to the interview. Having pre-written questions made me look more prepared and took the burden off of me of having to remember them.\\n* Push in your chair after getting up, like when leaving your interview. Similarly- if they offer you water at the start of your interview, make sure you throw out the cup in a trashcan and don't leave litter in their office.\\n* Maintain eye contact and speak slowly. For me, it helps when I use my hands when I talk.\\n* Look, dress, and smell nice. You don't have to be a model but definitely make yourself look the best you possibly can. Also, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.\\n* I like watching CareerVidz on Youtube because he comes across as a little silly and that may (hopefully) take some pressure off of you. It's okay to be nervous, but try not to make it apparent.\\n* Rehearse your [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54).\\n* Research the company you're applying for, before any interviews. You can show a genuine interest in the company by understanding what they do and who they are.\\n* References: If you don't have any professional references, you can definitely ask a course instructor or your Program Mentor! They are here to support you and they will absolutely vouch for you (speaking from experience).\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI think it's incredibly important to continuously grow and improve regardless of which stage you're at- whether you're considering enrolling, have already enrolled, are about to graduate, or even if you're looking for a job. I'm hopeful that my write-up is able to offer a fresh perspective on the challenges and possibilities you might encounter. Sorry for any typos/weirdly worded sentences lol.\\n\\nI'm now looking forward to starting my MSITM on April 1 and starting my new job. If you have any tips/advice for the MSITM program, I'd love to get some info\\n\\nHope to see y'all at the Vegas commencement ceremony!!\\n\\nEDITS: Expanded upon my internship, additional random bullet points all throughout</td>\n",

       "      <td>D288 - Back-End Programming 2024 Guide!\\nHello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click &gt; new &gt; Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n&gt;Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: &lt;version&gt;3.3.6&lt;/version&gt;\\nLombok: &lt;version&gt;1.18.36&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\\n&lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-parent&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\n&lt;version&gt;3.3.6&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\n\\n```\\n&lt;groupId&gt;org.projectlombok&lt;/groupId&gt;\\n&lt;artifactId&gt;lombok&lt;/artifactId&gt;\\n&lt;version&gt;1.18.36&lt;/version&gt;\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n&gt;MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n&gt;When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below. Other Reddit users and I will try and get to them and answer them accordingly. If a significant update/revision should be made to the guide, please leave a comment suggesting a change. I'll try and keep this guide relevant for at least a little while, but with the new degree plan coming, it will inevitably become superannuated.  \\n\\nIf you followed this guide and passed, **CONGRATS!** This is probably the most technical project I've done so far in my degree, and I had a lot of fun with it. So, I hope this guide made the class enjoyable for you too! Wishing you well in your future studies! 📚🎉</td>\n",

I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database &amp; SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&amp;list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching &amp; promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope &amp; out-of-scope), requirements (functional &amp; non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development &amp; testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.</td>\n",

       "      <td>D287 Java Frameworks Ultimate Project Guide\\nWGU students, by now you have likely experienced or heard how this course is low effort, half finished garbage. Well, since they can't be bothered to fix this course, it is up to us to help each other out. This post is my attempt to help fellow students with this project. After stumbling through this project for like a month and a half, I finally finished it and here is my best attempt at a guide.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly, get your IntelliJ Ultimate downloaded, and get your project files on your local machine. Check out my previous post at to get through task step A: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, so this project basically gives you a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and a myspace looking old school HTML user interface, and your job is to customize the code to meet a customers needs. You need to come up with a shop that will have 5 sample products, and 5 generic parts that can be combined to make those products. They give the example of a bicycle shop that has different bike types for products, like mountain bike/ road bike etc. and then generic parts for those such as seat, handlebars, gears etc. Do not overthink this, just choose something and keep it simple and generic.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nTo know what the heck is going on, here is some background info. To get something like this to work, it is convenient to use a framework, something to contain all your different files and get them to work together the way we want, while offering tools and libraries to simplify development and let us focus on the logic and features of the application we are creating. Often used with Spring is Spring boot, a sub project of Spring that simplifies things for us even more by using embedded web servers so you don't have to install and configure a separate web server, while also offering auto-configuration, so we have less to do manually to make sure that any files/classes etc that depend on other files/classes/methods etc have the information shared to be able to carry out their functions. This project uses a common design pattern known as MVC (model view controller). This is a way to organize an applications files based on its function which promotes organization, modularization, maintainability, reusability, testability, and improves development efficiency. Now if you have opened your project, it may seem overwhelming the amount of files in there, so I am going to try to tell you what files belong to what part of MVC, and a bit about what they do so you know what you are looking at.  \\n\\n\\n**Model:** represents the applications data and business logic. Encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the app, including data manipulation, validation, and interactions with the database. The files for this project relating to the model are:\\n\\n* Entities: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;domain you have 4 .java files containing entities. These are your classes, for the different types of parts, and for products. Entities are marked with the annotation '@Entity' which tells Spring this is an entity, allowing it to work its magic to make these work the way we want overall for the application.\\n* Repositories: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;repositories you have 4 repository .java files corresponding to the entity files. Repository files allow for CRUD (create read update delete) on the database. These files interact with the database and are marked with '@Repository'. Note that these files extend CrudRepository which eliminates the need for the annotation.\\n* Service: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;service, there are service files and service implementation files. The service files contain declarations but not the definitions, while the implementation files have the definitions to implement the service. Services interact with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.\\n* Validators: Found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;validators, contains .java files that contains the actual validation logic, and annotation files that allow you to make a custom annotation to easily mark your other files with ('@CustomAnnotation') to get the validation enforced. Code that enforces validation rules and constraints for your data.\\n\\n**View:** responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It encompasses the user interface elements, templates, and visual elements that users interact with. Views receive data from the Model and render it in a way that's suitable for presentation. Views also capture user input and pass it to the Controller for further processing. The files for the view layer are:\\n\\n* HTML Templates: src-&gt;main&gt;resources-&gt;templates. These are all your html files that contain the format and structure for the webpages you see. This project uses Thymeleaf, a template engine that helps make dynamic html content.\\n* CSS: found in src-&gt;main-&gt;resources-&gt;static-&gt;css. This provides additional styling for the webpages to enhance the look and feel.\\n\\n**Controller:** These classes handle user requests, process input, interact with the Model, and determine which View should be rendered. Controllers are annotated with '@Controller'. In general, a controller in a Spring application is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate HTTP response. Controllers typically have methods annotated with '@RequestMapping'(or other annotations like '@GetMapping','@PostMapping', etc.) to define the URL paths they handle and the HTTP methods they respond to. The controllers are found in src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;controllers.\\n\\n**Other Notable Files:** There are some files that aren't included in MVC but are still important to recognize. These are:\\n\\n* BootStrapData.java: The purpose of this class is to provide initial data for testing and development, ensuring that there is data to work with when starting the application. This file is located at src-&gt;main-&gt;java-&gt;com.example.demo-&gt;bootstrap\\n* application.properties: a configuration file in a Spring Boot application that allows you to configure various settings and properties for your application. It is used to customize the behavior of your application without requiring changes to the source code. \\n* test files: located at src-&gt;test, contains files for testing your code.\\n* .gitignore: this file is used to specify files and directories that you want ignored by git when tracking changes in your project. I did not use this file at all for this project. Is found in target directory.\\n* mvn &amp; mvnw: These are files used to ensure the right version of Maven is being used to build the project regardless of whether you have it installed or not. Maven is a build automation and project management tool that simplifies the process of managing and building software projects by providing a structured way to handle dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging.\\n* pom.xml: is the Project Object Model configuration file used by Maven to define project details, dependencies, and build settings for a Java project.\\n* README.md: is used to provide a brief and informative description of a project, often found at the root of a repository, to help users understand its purpose and usage. We will be using this file to track the changes we make for task steps C thru J.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, hopefully that helps, I was completely lost and overwhelmed at first but hopefully that gives you some background and helps you see how the pieces fit together. If it doesn't make sense yet, it will start to as you work through the project and see how things work together and interact. Anyway, on to the tasks!\\n\\n**NOTE:** to view and test your web app, open your browser and go to localhost:8080. This will show you your webpage in its current state. You must run the application successfully in IntelliJ for this to work. You will be using this a lot to make sure your changes are working the way you want and you are meeting the requirements.  \\n\\n\\n**Task B:** This part is super easy, they want you to create a README file, but there already is one! What I did here was I kept the nice WGU and D287 header stuff deleted the rest, and then I copy and pasted the task requirements from parts C to J so I could type my changes for each part under the step it is a part of.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**NOTE:**  For tasks C - J you have to commit and push with a message to the remote repository after the completion of each step. You are allowed to push more often, but at a minimum you must push after each step is completed and put a brief meaningful message. At the end you will have to get the history and submit it with your zip file. I made a new branch to do all my changes to, and named it working\\_brach, as this is more common than doing work on the main branch. To make a new branch, go to the bottom right of the screen, click the current branch, and it will bring up some options. Click new branch, name it something like working\\_branch, and check the box for checkout branch so that you make it the branch you are working on.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task C:** For this step, you will be working in mainscreen.html. You will need to customize this page to reflect your custom shop choice, changing the titles and headers appropriately. Make sure to log the changes and locations on the README. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message. You can do this by clicking the git tab and then clicking commit, and it should bring up a commit window where your project window usually is, and then you can select what changes to commit, type your message, and select commit &amp; push. Almost every time I did this, I got warnings and it stopped the push, and I had to click push anyway. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task D:** For this part you need to understand some basic html. This step you need to make an about page, and so you will need firstly a template, so create a new html template with all your other templates (when asked if you want to add your new file to git, always say yes). This file will be where you create all the visuals for your about page, where you describe briefly your business and who its for. I just put some super generic stuff about how we care about the customer and giving back etc. I copy and pasted the first 12 or so lines from another html template just so it had the same styling and structure info as the other webpages. I personally tried to match the look of mainscreen.html, but you can make it however you want. Remember to catalogue each change you make in the README.md file. For example, if you add a title for your about page, you would put something like: -about.html: added title 'About' on line 15. You need to say what file, have it under the correct task letter, and say what line(s) the change(s) is(are) on and what the change(s) is(are). When you are satisfied with your about.html, you will need to make a controller for it in the directory with all the other controllers. The controller is being used to map the URL to  the corresponding webpage and guiding Spring on which template to utilize for rendering the content. Remember to annotate your controller with '@Controller' just like in the other controller classes, and you will also need the @GetMapping(\"name\\_of\\_about\\_template\\_here\") in your class definition to connect the template and the url such that you can reach this page and see it by going to localhost:8080/about\\_template\\_name\\_here. Check out the other controller classes to get an idea how for this, or watch a video on it if needed. On mainscreen.html, you will need to add a button that takes you to the about page you created, I just copy and pasted similar code for other buttons and changed the link for it and name to make this work. Similarly, on your about html file you will want to add a link or a button back to the mainscreen. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n **Task E:** Now you need to add a sample inventory consisting of 5 products and 5 parts. There is commented out code in the BootStrapData.java file that gives you an example of how to create a part and a product (in separate spots), you can use that and change it to make 5 of each. You either need to add an if statement that checks if the parts count and products count is zero before adding the sample inventory, or you will need to comment your code out after the sample is added to your page so you don't keep adding duplicates. If you don't add the logic to check for this, make sure to make a note somewhere to uncomment this code back out before you submit your project, or it will get sent back as they will not see your sample database get loaded in. (Hint: I used variables for part count and product count and set them equal to their respective repository classes and used the .count() method to see if both were == 0 before adding the sample inventory). Once you are done, commit and push with a message. Make sure you are logging all your changes!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task F:** This step asks you to add a Buy Now button next to the update and delete buttons for your products. The button needs to decrease the inventory of the purchased product by one, and make no changes to the inventory of parts. You need to display a message for failure or success of a purchase. First I would add the button to mainscreen.html in the appropriate spot. There is a table in mainscreen.html that sets up the products table, you will see it referencing tempProduct.name, .price, .inv, and then you will see the update and delete buttons. You will want to add your Buy Now button in here. The button here is a bit tricky as you need it to map to /buyProduct URL (we will make the controller for this later) and you need to set it up for http POST request so it can access and update the inventory amount for purchased products. You also need to pass a hidden input field so that you can pass the tempProduct.id along to the controller. I would post the code for this but I don't want this post to get taken down lol. Next you need to make a new controller to handle the desired behavior of the buy now button. Once you make your controller, make sure to annotate it as a controller. For this controller I added a private ProductRepository object with an '@Autowired' annotation, as the ProductRepository provides methods for interacting with the database which we need to do to decrement the inventory by 1 after purchase, and the annotation injects an instance of ProductRepository into this controller, which allows it to use the methods it needs. Just like the other controllers, we are going to make a public String method, I called it buyProduct. For its input parameters, you need to use the '@RequestParam' annotation to be able to obtain the productID from the product that was purchased over on mainscreen. Next I created an Optional &lt;Product&gt; object that assigns its value to the .findById method of the product repository, using the productID obtained from '@RequestParam'. By using Optional&lt;Product&gt;, the code handles the possibility that the requested product might not exist in the database. It avoids directly returning null when the product is not found, which helps improve code readability and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. This object basically represents whether the product was found in the database or not. Using that, you can set up if statements based on whether that object.isPresent() is true or not, and if it is true, you can create a Product object and set it equal to the optional object.get(). You can then set up an additional if statement that checks if that products inventory (product.getInv) is above 0, if it is then you can set the inventory for it to its current value -1 (decrement the inventory like the instructions wanted). Make sure to save this new value using the product repository .save() method to save the new count to the repository. If this part of the code is reached, then the product had enough in stock to be purchased, its inventory was subtracted by one to reflect a purchase, and now you can generate a success message. There are many ways to do this (as is the case with most of the project), but I personally made a new html template both for a purchase success and a purchase error. You can use a redirect statement in your return statement to the url of your success page for the case that the purchase went through, or to your error page if it did not. You will need to add '@GetMapping' annotations and displayPurchaseSuccess (or error) methods that return to the appropriate url. After the controller is all setup, you make your html templates for the success and error pages if thats the way you chose to do. These can be super simple, basically mine just said purchase successful or purchase error in big letters when the page loaded. When everything is working and looking the way you want, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task G:** In this step you have to add max and min inventory fields for parts, modify your sample inventory to show the max and min inventory, and update both the part forms to have additional inputs for the max and min inventory. Then they want you to rename the database file, and add code that enforces that the inventory is between the max and min values. First go to Part.java, and add the minInv and maxInv fields (name em whatever you want), you can also use the same '@Min' annotation as the other fields to enforce that it cannot be below zero, and have a message with it. Be sure to also add a new constructor that includes these new fields, and make getter and setter functions for them. Next go back to BootStrapData.java and add max and min inventory values for your sample inventory parts. Then for both InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm, add text inputs for both max and min inventory. You can probably figure out how to put it in there just by seeing how the other fields are put in there and copying it but changing as necessary. Then rename the database file, it will look something like this **spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db** you can find it in file explorer or finder and right click it and rename it to whatever you like. In the application.properties file, you will need to rename it there as well and make sure they match. Next I would create a method in Part.java that checks if an inventory is valid, by returning true if the inventory falls between the max and min values, and returns false otherwise. For both inhouse and outsourced part controller files, add logic that uses the isInvValid method you created to generate an error message if the inventory is outside of range. I used BindingResult to reject bad values with a message, look into this for the error messaging. Once this is working as expected and desired, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task H:** This step wants you to add additional error messages and more specific error messages, one for if the inventory is below the minimum, one for if the inventory is above the maximum, and one for if adding/updating a product would cause an associated part to fall below the minimum. This isn't too bad, adding some more if else type logic to both inhouse and outsourced part controllers will take care of the first two conditions I listed. For the last requirement, I edited EnufPartsValidator.java with some additional requirements in the if statement that returns false to check if any of the parts for the product would fall below their minimum if the product was made (Hint: p.getInv() - 1 &lt; p.getMinInv()). I also updated the error message from ValidEnufParts to be more specific. When you are happy with the results and everything has been tested and working, commit with a message and push. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task I:** Add two unit tests to the PartTest class for the maximum and minimum inventory fields. The course resources has a video for this. You go to the file, and use the '@Test' annotation, and then make two tests that look similar to the tests already in this file. For min, you can set the minimumInv to a number that you expect to be the lowest to be used for the program, its just an arbitrary test number. Then you use partIn and set its value to the variable you just assigned, and use assertEquals() to make sure that it works as expected. Repeat for partOut. Do all this again but for maximumInv. Thats it for this one. When it is working, commit and push with message.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Task J:** Remove the class files for any unused validators. This one was so simple it had me doubting myself. When you open the validators, it will tell you how many usages intellij recognized for them. One of them had no usages so I deleted that one. It was really that simple lol. Commit and push with a message. This is the last step that needs to be tracked in the read me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nNow double check you meet all the rubric requirements, watch the completed project video from the course resources and make sure you got all the right stuff, and when you are satisfied and everything is working, export your project to a ZIP. Next on Gitlab, go to the code tab on the left hand side, expand it with a click and then select repository graph. This shows your commit and push history and must be turned in. Use print button and then specify print to PDF, and save it to your computer. You must turn this in with your project ZIP. Finally, get the url for your gitlab by clicking the blue clone button and copying the https url. When you submit, you need the ZIP, the repository graph, and the URL. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI hope this guide helps, please let me know of any mistakes or typos, I wanted to do this quickly and move on to my next course. If you have questions feel free to ask, but just know I stumbled my way through this and by no means to I understand everything or am an expert. This guide does not constitute the right way, best way, only way, or most efficient way to do this project. It is just what worked for me. I tried to tell you as much as possible without just giving things away and getting in trouble lol.  When you guys finish this course, make sure to let them know honestly how you feel about the course in the end of course survey! Best of luck. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;</td>\n",

       "      <td>WGU MBA - The \"Sort of\" Accelerated Adventure\\nJuly seems to be a good month for me. July 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from WGU in Business Management. After that was done, I wrote this post, to give my take on the \"Sort of\" acceleration I did through my undergrad studies. It's a long read...but...if you want context for this post...feel free to give it a skim: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu\\_bs\\_in\\_business\\_management\\_the\\_sortof/geijacp/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu_bs_in_business_management_the_sortof/geijacp/?context=3)\\n\\nFast forward to July 2021...and I just completed my MBA at WGU as well. Like I said...July seems to be my jam. My first Graduate Term at WGU started in October 2020, so I accelerated two years of course work, into a little less than 10 months. Not too shabby. \\n\\nNow, you've likely seen other posts. \"I accelerated my Bachelors degree (or MBA) in 2 weeks\" or something of the like. My point here, is the same as it was last time: I'm not racing anyone. I applaud those who were able to do in minutes what took me months. However, for those who are still with me here...keep in mind I work full time in the Tech sector as a Senior Program Manager, I coach high school athletics on the side, and I have a family that I happen to enjoy spending time with. That's why I title my posts as a \"sort of\" acceleration. I don't have every hour of my day to devote to classwork so I can hammer out 11 classes in 11 days; but I want to give back to the WGU subreddit, because I got a lot of assists from these posts and I want to help others, who may only be looking for a kick in the arse that they can do it too. I did what I could in the evenings to devote to my school work, and on weekends too. But, I really didn't sacrifice an entire weekend to school at any point. I enjoy sipping my coffee. I also just happened to have an Appendicitis during my MBA Adventure, so that didn't exactly help my cause! \\n\\nI gave a lot of advice and pro-tips in my Bachelor's Degree post above. But, I'll reiterate the important ones here, up front:   \\n\\n\\n**1)** Get a Business Calculator, (I bought the BA II Plus) and learn it. *Know thy calculator*. It will save you a LOT of time. \"But, hey OP. I have a graphing calculator. I'm good.\" Sure, but, you could be better off. The Business Calculator, when you get into the Financing Courses will legit save you a ton of time. \\n\\n**2)** Be nice to your exam proctors. They work in a call center for God knows how many hours a day, watching people take exams. Sometimes they'll ask you to do something that no other proctor asks you to do. Just, go with it. Sometimes I was asked to take off my Smart Watch, sometimes, I wasn't. Sometimes I was asked to take my hand away from my face during exams (I tend to rest my chin on my hands during exams); other times, I wasn't asked to do that. Sometimes I quietly talk through an exam question to myself, and sometimes the proctor would chime in and ask me if I was talking to someone in the room, and I'd have to rotate the camera to show I was alone; and sometimes it didn't matter at all. But, there's no need to make your proctored exams more stressful then they may already be. Just go with the flow. They're human, just like you and I are, and there isn't a single proctor out there like \"I'm totally going to try and get this person to fail their exam\". Be kind. \\n\\n**3)** Be patient when you submit papers for grading. They have three days to return it to you. *Pro-Tip*: if you can avoid it, try to get your papers submitted before the end of the month. There is legitimately a term ending at the end of every month; so the volume increases a lot at the end of the month. I generally found papers I'd turn in, in the middle of the month would get graded in 12-36 hours; whereas at the end of the month, you can bank on it taking all three days. For whatever it's worth to you. \\n\\n**4)** Regarding papers: I said it before, I will repeat myself: Follow. The. Rubric. Every. Single. Word. Of. It. If you deviate from the Rubric, it doesn't matter how much you write, or how eloquent you are, or what your experience is in professional writing in your career. You will get your paper returned. You could write War and Peace, and get your paper returned. Or, you could follow the Rubric, write two pages, and pass. Just give them what they ask for, because that's what they're looking for to grade.\\n\\n**5)** It's okay to fall behind a bit, or to stall out a bit. My term started in October 2020. I didn't even get to open the first course until November, because of a work deadline. You can catch up. In the MBA program, you have six months to complete three classes. Anything else, is gravy. \\n\\n**6)** Take the Pre-Assessment straight-away when starting a class with a proctored exam. Have no fear. There is no penalty for getting crushed on the Pre-Assessment, and there's no limit to the number of times you can take it. But, you want the Assessment Report at the end of it. It will not only tell you the weight of each section to better help you study, but will also give you an answer key to see what you missed. As a bonus, if you pass it, it unlocks your Proctored Exam (Objective Assessment/OA) right away, so you can schedule it. I took the Pre-Assessment straight-away for every class I had with an exam, and it helped me shore up where I was weak, and I saved time by not studying sections I aced. \\n\\n**7)** Get a Quizlet account. You're welcome.\\n\\nHere we go:   \\n\\n\\nThere are eleven courses to complete for your MBA. Six of them have a Proctored Exam, five are written papers. The Data Driven Decision Making course (C207) has both Proctored Exam, and two papers to write. I'm going through them, in the order I took them, over the course of ten months (one, six-month term, and then three and a half months of a second term). I took some cues from a post by [https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) and his Mega Thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/). I always like to give credit where it's due. They had a bit of a different journey than I did, but we also had some similarities. But, I did draw some inspiration from their post, which is why it looks similar! \\n\\n**Managing Organizations and Leading People (C200)** *– Two Papers*   \\nThey ease you in with a pretty easy class up front. First up, get the Signature Themes Assessment out of the way. I think it took me about a half hour ish. Download the result, and start in on your papers. I wrote both papers over the course of two days. Paper 1 wants you to talk about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Paper 2 is for you to use a situation with a real organization, but you have to redact the info, and make up fake names. Then you write about a leader you know in the org. No reinvention of the wheel here. \\n\\n**Managing Human Capital (C202)** *– One Proctored Exam (OA)*   \\nThis class was super chill. Honestly, anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content here as common workplace knowledge. Not necessarily every word, but you know what I mean. I took the pre-assessment straight-away without looking at a single word of the course, passed it, and then scheduled my OA for that weekend to give me a couple days to study where I was weak. Took my OA a couple days later, and passed. \\n\\n**Management Communication (C204)** *– One Paper, One PowerPoint &amp; Video + One Executive Summary*   \\nPaper 1 involves writing up a few emails and letters to your staff, your industry contact and your shareholders of your company that distributes a hot and fancy new product, depending on your chosen scenario. you pick. This is a class to have fun with. Level of Difficulty is not high at all. After Paper 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow. The. Rubric. Then you make a Panopto video. It's very easy. You download and install the Panopto (or use the web version). When it opens, add your PowerPoint you created, and start recording your presentation. My video was about 8 1/2 minutes, and I passed on the first attempt. Then write your Executive Summary of your PPTX and submit the lot. This all took me about a work week in the evenings, but if you had a weekend you could probably hammer it out in a full day, maybe two.\\n\\n**Marketing (C212)** *– One Paper*   \\nI've seen other posts calling this paper a monster. I respectfully disagree. Mine was ten pages, including the title page, table of contents and references. So, my actual content was seven pages long. Just follow the Rubric. I've seen other posts where they wrote 16+ pages. They must reeeeeeeeeally love writing more than I do. I don't add a lot of fluff. Just write what they ask for. You are tasked with writing a proposal for a hot new product from any of seven provided industries. (I work in the Technology sector, so I chose Technology.) This took me about a week, but I started this class the day after Thanksgiving. So, between Turkey Coma and Black Friday (which, let's be honest...due to COVID-19, there wasn't really a Black Friday, as much as there was me not wanting to look at school while I made leftover stuffing...and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...)\\n\\nI'm grouping the next two together. C213 and C214. Here comes that need for the Business Calculator. Friendly Reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Let it do the work for you. My best advice is this: Do whatever you must with your Program Mentor to get them to schedule these two back-to-back. Bribe them, beg them, or simply ask them. Taking C214 immediately after C213 is a game changer, as they tie into one another like Cookies and Cream. I asked my mentor about it; he sort of waffled; so I asked again, and he adjusted my Degree Plan so I could take them back-to-back. \\n\\n**Accounting for Decision Makers (C213)** *– One OA*  \\nThere are some calculations and math, but not too terribly much. I've seen other posts that say \"don't worry about the math, just focus on all the other class material and you'll be good\". False. Disagree. Nope. Spend time on the math. There's enough math on the exam that if you bomb the math, you're going to essentially need to be perfect on the rest of the exam to pass. I have a strategy on any sort of Finance, Statistics, or Math exams that include theory questions as well. I do the non-math related questions first. If I get to a question that includes an equation, I skip it, and come back to it. Save all the math to last, that way once I switch my brain to calculations, I don't have to switch it back. For me, that's helps bring down the stress level. (Having a beer with me during the exam also helps. Just saying.) I used the same strategy for Financial Management. This one took me four days, because I had a weekend in there that I could devote 2-3 hours at a time to, here and there. Otherwise, probably would have taken a week or so, with after work studying.\\n\\n**Financial Management (C214)** – *One OA*   \\nAnother reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Especially if you've never used a financial calculator before. All the formulas you need will be given to you on the Pre-Assessment and the OA, you don’t have to remember any of them. You'll find many things from C213 carry over here, so that's nice...and the reason I say do whatever you can to take this immediately after C213. Memorize the Financial Concepts as best you can. The math won’t be crazy tough, especially if you *Know thy calculator*. There are more non-math questions than there are finance math questions, but don't skimp on learning the math. Last thing you want is to start second guessing your non-math question answers, because you're not feeling too confident about the Finance Math questions. This one took me two weeks, an hour here and an hour there. \\n\\n**Ethical Leadership (C206)** – *Three Papers*   \\nI admit it. Writing papers bores me to death. With an exam, I can get in, hammer it out, and be done. Not so much with papers. But, c'est la vie. Another easy one, just a time suck because of having to write not one, not two, but ***three*** papers. Blah. First up, do the “Ethical Lens Inventory” task in the course itself. Pretty sure this took me a half hour or so. For Paper 1, write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. I used someone I used to work for. But, I've seen other posts that they wrote about Lincoln, etc. Write about different leadership concepts. For Paper 2, write about social responsibility and leadership. For Paper 3, write about the code of ethics and its various leadership applications. All three papers, including citations, was a total of 21 pages of writing. Took me two weeks, but in fairness, I was doing this right before Christmas, and decorating the tree, watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and wrapping presents took priority. I'm not sorry. :-)\\n\\n**Data-Driven Decision Making (C207)** – *Two Papers and One OA*   \\nI've read other posts basically calling this class The Devil. Like, bust out the Exorcism for this class, and burn it at the stake for heresy. Honestly, I didn't think it was all that horrible. But, I enjoy data, so to each their own. It took me three weeks. First, form a hypothesis, then you complete Paper 1, which is a form they provide, and turn it in. Then, the data fun starts. Follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis option from the list. I will say this, don't overly complicate things, regardless of how much you like data. Use the T-Test. It's the simplest one, requiring the least amount of data, and therefore has the least friction. You could choose others, but that's like deciding to run a full marathon when you registered for a half-marathon. Not like you're going to get two medals for finishing. Anyways, plot the numbers in Excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for 30 data points. (*Pro-Tip*: Make sure you have the add-on installed in Excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions if you don't). You have to write Paper 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. I was able to get data from my wife's place of work, so this probably made things easier for me too. After Paper 2 passes, then it's time for the OA. Remember when I said \"Get a Quizlet account\" up above? You should use it here. If you're not a data person, take your time. Data isn't an easy topic for many people, so put on your Patience Hat, and grab a beer while you study. \\n\\n**Operations Management (C215)** – *One OA*   \\nSo, I've spent some of my career in Ops Management, so I breezed through this one. I wish I had some pearls of wisdom to share here. I was done in four days, and that's only because the closest OA I could schedule when I wasn't at work...or at near midnight was four days after I took the Pre-Assessment. Topics included supply/demand, operations and employee functions, and process improvement. But again, I've worked in this field, and when I passed the Pre-Assessment with Exemplary across the board, I didn't even bother to crack the study material. So, you may want to search for another sub-Reddit thread that goes into detail here.  \\n\\n**Global Economics for Managers (C211)** – *One OA*   \\nIf you pay even a small bit of attention to business environments, the economy, currency exchange, global corporation behavior, this won’t be a headache. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge on my part. I took the pre-assessment right away as per usual, then scheduled the OA for later that week. Took about 6 days from start to finish. But, this was my last OA, and a cause for celebration! \\n\\n**MBA Capstone (C216)** – *One Business Simulation + Three Papers*   \\nPaper 1 is a PowerPoint presentation + Panopto video (Exactly like C204 above). Task 2 is a pretty lengthy paper as a Stockholder Report (mine was 19 pages); Paper 3 is basically submitting your resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and a tiny paper on what you learned during the MBA that helped you on the Capstone Simulation (mine was 5 total pages, including the cover page and Table of Contents). \\n\\nOf all the courses I have taken with WGU, including my Undergraduate course load, this was by far my most favorite. An actual workplace simulation of opening your own small business. There is a lot of work to do for this course, as there should be for a culminating final of a graduate level degree program. All up, I spent close to three weeks on this sucker. I could have done it faster, but I wanted my presentations to be air tight. Also...above I mentioned an Appendicitis. Well, this is when it hit, was during my Capstone. So, take that into consideration as well. Start off with the simulation. The simulation consists of a start-up business and it's first six quarters of operation that you have to get through. After you get to the end of Q4, you have to stop and that is the information you use for Paper 1 (the PPTX presentation/video) to justify your decisions you've made up to that point.  You actually cannot progress to Q5 and Q6 in the simulation until you pass Paper 1. Don't forget: Follow. The. Rubric. To. The. Letter. This is basically a sales pitch to potential investors in your business. Also, this is where you have to be in professional dress for the camera, so ditch the hoodie and put on a collared shirt. *Pro-Tip 1*: Submit Paper 1, then submit Q4 in the Simulation, in that order. Don't submit your Q4 decisions before turning in the Paper. *Pro-Tip 2*: Do the \"Final Check\" each quarter before you submit your results. Don't deviate from that. You can really screw yourself if you muck something up and submit it. The Final Check looks for errors. Once you pass Paper 1, you'll be able to move on to Q5 and Q6. \\n\\nNext, you'll complete the final two quarters, then comes Paper 2, the Stockholder Report. To beat the long dead horse, Follow. The. Rubric. This isn't going to be a short paper, so buckle up, and knuckle down. This paper is written as a narrative, so don't use the Bullet Points from the Task 2 explanations. You don't want it written as a Book Report; you want to tell the graders a story about why you did what you did, and when you did it, and why you did it.  You'll download reports from the simulation, and take screenshots, and have appendices. But, you can do it, because you're storytelling. Since you made the decisions along the way, you know why you did what you did. You just have to explain it, like you're telling a story about it. I found it to be very fun, and I learned quite a bit by doing it. Again, easily my most favorite class I took at WGU. Once this one is submitted, you're basically in the clear. All the grinding work is done, and Paper 3 awaits...and...they sure do lob you a softball on this one to swing at.\\n\\nPaper 3 is writing a quick explanation of of three competencies you used throughout the MBA program that helped you successfully complete the simulation. You'll then create a SMART goal about your career. Then you discuss and attach three artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification or other that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future. (I used my undergrad degree, and two professional certifications I have - my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and my PMP Certification as my three.) Then update your resume (make sure WGU is listed as the latest school with the expected degree end month and year). Then, print off your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or create a profile if you don't have one). But...don't trip at the finish line! **Follow. The. Rubric.** You don't want the final thing you have to do to be having to re-do a cupcake Paper because you hit Auto-Pilot. Submit the lot. Once you punch submit that last time, sit back and remember Advice Point 3 from above, about being patient while they grade papers. Head to the pub, and drink a well earned beer. Maybe add some Chili-Cheese Fries, for posterity. Just sit and wait to see the good news email hit your Inbox with that glorious subject line \"**You Passed!**\" You did it!!! You made a choice to get your MBA...and now...it's yours! Your program mentor will call or email you very soon. They'll gush about how awesome you did. You'll get an email from Records, that your Mentor submitted you for graduation. Fill that application out when the email comes through. It'll take a couple days to process your degree; and within a couple weeks, you'll get a digital degree you can use online, and shortly thereafter, a package from your Mail Carrier with a super rad piece of paper within, declaring that WGU certifies you to be a master of all things business administration related!\\n\\nCongratulations to you, you're now the proud owner of a Graduate Degree. Now, when you see career opportunities that say \"MBA Required\"; you get to smile; and that's a pretty rad feeling. \\n\\nAnd to you...yes you...reading this wondering if you should enroll. You have obligations. You don't know if you can carve out the time. You work yourself to the bone, and barely have time to sleep. You can do it. I legit work 50+ hour weeks, then I go coach high school sports, then I like to have free time and spend it with my family. Oh...one other thing...I also run marathons competitively. Do you know how long a 23 mile training run takes on a Sunday morning? You don't want to know. But, I made a decision. I knew I could sacrifice some time to open doors that were closed to me previously. Because, it doesn't take forever to get that MBA. It only takes a little time, right now. The longer you delay, the longer it will be before you finish. \\n\\nYou can do it. You can. You just have to make the choice. I don't know you. I will never meet you. I don't know your story, or how you got to where you are right now that lead you to this post. But...I believe in you. But, me believing in you isn't good enough. YOU have to believe in you too. So, stop reading this, and get cracking on that MBA. It's already printed off. It just needs to know your name so it can find it's way to your mailbox and live out it's days, decorating your wall in a diploma frame. :-)\\n\\nGood luck!</td>\n",

I would love  to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any  kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it. You can  do it, but remember that everyone is different.\\n\\nI  will however, link you to a blank APA template I used for all my  papers. It is formatted with headers and everything, with a brief  explanation of the sections. I used this template for all my papers. You  can download it from my google drive:\\n\\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6FWjGvKR5H7DCgRaLvpmh5rssFz-0RS/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b6FWjGvKR5H7DCgRaLvpmh5rssFz-0RS/view?usp=sharing)\\n\\nPlease feel free to copy **any and all**  methods for use, but again, please remember, everyone is different! If  you are planning to start soon and wanna break my record, Go for it!  Also, if you are already started, but wanna try to accelerate, hopefully  a little from this write-up can help you too! The goal is to finish,  even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast!  I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however,  anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I  personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before  I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back  a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use  this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes  relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore  we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s  coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will  suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting  your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*,  that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est  this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est  re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not  pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*.  If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of  thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass  before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*,  and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2  days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est  thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then  add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try.

This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good. Job  well done.\\n\\n[\\(You can do it!\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qc5bhx6kre051.jpg?width=653&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e976844dd1590b122f3580644ec34cbf84c5d8)</td>\n",



       "0  Tips for Accelerating Your MBA (or Not!) - Course Tips & Recommended Resources\\nLet me start by saying this. I was what my mentor referred to as a \"super-accelerator.\" I won't get into the exact timeline because I know that can rile some people up here and discourage others, and that's not my intention, but it was fast. I gave myself 4 months, and I didn't need most of that time. That doesn't matter in your case, or anyone else's, though. Our backgrounds will be different. Our learning style will be different. And the time we can spend on this will be different. The course tips and resources I'll share below are what worked for me. I hope they'll help you navigate the program no matter your intended speed, but know my methods aren't \"the right way\" by any means. You'll each put together your own system or path through the program. And honestly, that adaptability and customization is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing WGU!\\n\\nSide note: I've been part of a great Discord study group someone started here on Reddit, and that support system was so important to the process. I highly encourage you to find other students starting around the same time as you to network with, study with, or get whatever extra interaction you need.\\n\\n**My Background**\\n\\nI'm not a traditional MBA student in that I didn't pursue this to find a new job or get a promotion. I've run my own business for 20 years. Between that and prior roles with corporate and large nonprofit employers, I've worn most hats you can imagine at one point or another.\\n\\nI also have a business-oriented Bachelor's degree in a specialty area, and I'd already started taking MBA-related courses back then. It was supposed to be a dual-degree add-on of one year, but I wasn't able to complete the MBA due to life and financial circumstances at the time.\\n\\nIt's taken far too long to get back to it. But I came in with extensive business experience and also with an academic background that helped me move quickly through these courses. I was in a position that I could take time away from the business to focus on school full-time with minimal financial impact. That often meant very long days. I don't recommend it. It's just the way I work when my mind hyperfocuses on something. It's not something I actively choose.\\n\\n**A Note on Accelerating**\\n\\nYou'll see people say you can't retain anything if you accelerate. And that's only partly true. If you come in with no experience or minimal business school background, you might struggle with this, and I don't recommend accelerating to any kind of extreme pace. Aim to pull as much value out of the program as possible.\\n\\nBut for many of us, we've spent years already \"retaining\" many of these things. Some, like me, will have broad business experience. Others will have specialized knowledge (which I also had for a couple of these courses). That might mean you can accelerate nothing, everything, or just specific classes. Only you know what will work for you.\\n\\nI also had a supportive partner during the process who took on some extra responsibilities so I could focus on my program (we both do that for each other when we're pushing to reach important goals), and we don't have kids or other caregiver responsibilities. I'm telling you this because comparison without these kinds of details is pointless.\\n\\nIf you complete the entire program in a few months, that's incredible. If it's 6-months, awesome! You saved yourself a bundle by doing it in one term. If it takes you a year? That's still fast in terms of MBA programs, and you should be so proud of yourself. If you're doing this part-time while caring for kids and managing a full-time job and it takes you 18 months with everything going on in your life, OMG, you are AMAZING being able to tackle this huge achievement on top of everything else!\\n\\nDon't compare yourself to others. Find inspiration. Share stories and tips. But please do what's best for you and your goals, and be supportive of each other.\\n\\n**Doing \"the Bare Minimum\"**\\n\\nYou'll also find people here and elsewhere talking about doing the bare minimum in an effort to accelerate. I don't hold that against anyone if they're getting what they need out of the program, like ticking a box for a promotion. You do you!\\n\\nThat said, it's not something I would recommend. And, more important, I want to make it clear to those who do want to accelerate, you don't have to take this \"bare minimum\" approach. My experience doesn't reflect that. And if you have the professional experience already, you can absolutely put your all into this and still fly through.\\n\\nFor example, I never had a PA returned for revisions. I passed every OA on the first attempt. I scored exemplary on every OA but one (and that was me second-guessing myself on something that influenced several responses... I'll be kicking myself for that for a while). I scored in the top 10% globally on my capstone simulation. I also just found out yesterday that I earned a capstone excellence award. So if you're a fellow overachiever, you can do better than I believed after reading some prior program feedback. Again, you do you. And I hope some of you will do even better than me!\\n\\nAlso, like I mentioned earlier, pull as much value out of this as you can. It can help in classes if you associate certain concepts and problems with real-life scenarios. Think ahead to how they might help you in the future. For example, C214 has me re-thinking investment strategy and looking to learn more in that area post-MBA. C212 is a great opportunity to play with a product idea you might be bouncing around if you'd like to launch a business in the future. C202 might give you HR insights that help you be a better manager (or better communicate with your manager at your current job). C207 could directly apply to decisions you'll make in the future, from a new business launch to a big project you're considering in your current job (or proposals you might want to make to help make a case for a promotion). Rather than looking for the easiest way to tick that box, I highly encourage you to think about how each class could directly help you improve in your job or pursue your goals. Tying the concepts to something that interests you can also make the material easier to wrap your head around.\\n\\n**Course Tips & Resource Recommendations**\\n\\nHere we go! Note: I'm not going to rank these based on difficulty as our experience levels will vary.\\n\\nIf you see OA after a course name, that means you'll take a proctored exam. If you see PA, that means you'll do a performance assessment. Those are usually papers, but they can also include PowerPoint and video presentations.\\n\\nI'll also include a pre-game plan for anyone who wants to get a jump on courses a bit early.\\n\\n**C200 - Managing Organizations & Leading People (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis course is about reflecting on leadership skills and how they can be improved. I felt it was a nice way to kick off the program. For each assessment you'll choose one leadership theory to apply. Note: they must be different.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nYour first PA (a paper) involves you taking something called the CliftonStrengths assessment, then writing about your results, your own perceived leadership strengths and weaknesses, and setting goals to improve.\\n\\nThe second PA (also a paper) is similar, but you'll evaluate the leadership style of another leader. Think of a past employer or in my case a client for example. You'll change their name and organization name in the process.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nOther than closely following the rubrics, the only course resources I used for this one were the recorded cohort videos that went over how to tackle each paper. My mentor also sent me summary pages for the different leadership theories before my start date so I could choose the best ones to apply and look into them further. You do not need to know all of them... just the two you choose. These were her own resources, and not all mentors will do this.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nThis tip will apply to ALL courses! Once you get through Orientation, you should be able to access courses pages so you can do the course planning tools before meeting with your mentor. On that page, look to the right. You'll see what looks like a search box that says \"course search.\" It's actually a link / button. Click it, and you'll have early access to instructor resources like the Resource Document for the course. In there, you'll find links to the recorded cohorts that go over the tasks. You won't have rubric access yet... but they show it all throughout the video. So you can get a feel for what's coming!\\n\\nI chose to go further by purchasing the student CliftonStrengths assessment so I could complete it early and start on my papers ($25). You certainly don't need to do that.\\n\\nThink ahead about a leader you might want to write about for the second paper.\\n\\nIf you don't get info from your mentor on the leadership theories you can choose from, here's the list. Just look them up and see which fits: trait, behavioral, participative, transactional, situational, servant, and transformational leadership theories.\\n\\n**C202 - Managing Human Capital (OA)**\\n\\nThis is your human resources course. There's a lot of information, but it's manageable. The instructor resources are very good for this class.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThis one has an exam. It's around 70 questions I believe. This was one of the quicker exams to get through. All concepts.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nI didn't use the e-text at all for this course. I highly recommend going right to the course resource document (under \"course tips\" or you can find it early under the \"course search\" link). In there, these are the resources I focused on:\\n\\n* Know to Pass video (it's just under 2 hours; I took notes while watching; slides are also available to download; this is hands-down the best resource for the course)\\n* 4 Practice Question Review Session videos (collectively around 2.5 hours, but you can speed these up; these are amazing because they help you work through the types of questions asked and how to pull out what they really want; bonus is these videos will help you with ALL future OAs because the question style can be similar)\\n\\nThere are a lot of other resources in there including short videos, ones specifically covering \"tricky topics\" students struggle with, and chapter slides. Browse through them. Do the chapter quizzes even if you don't read the text. If you get through those, you should be good for the pre-assessment. Do well there? Go for the OA. Use the text to help brush up on specific topics you're struggling with. Make sure you understand key legislation, protected classes, affirmative action, adverse impact vs disparate treatment, and Kirkpatrick's training evaluation model (more than that, but those were important concepts to understand).\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo to the \"course search\" area as soon as you can access the course page (it doesn't have to be opened yet). Find the resource document in there. You can watch the cohort recorded videos early if you want to get a jump on things. You'll also find slides there if you prefer to learn by reading. The e-text won't be available early.\\n\\n**C204 - Management Communication (2 PAs)**\\n\\nThis was one of the more disappointing classes for me, being a specialist in this space. Even I struggled to understand what they were asking for in the assessments at times, and I just felt like the instructor resources were lacking compared to some of the other courses. But I still got through everything fine on the first attempt. If you're confused by instructions or the rubric, watch videos walking you through parts of them. Not the most helpful, but it does remove some of the confusion.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThe first task is a portfolio of different communication projects. For example, you'll write an email, a more formal letter, and a short blog post. They'll give you a scenario these pieces are based on. Nothing too complicated here.\\n\\nThe second one is your first presentation. When they talk about \"research\" it might sound like you're expected to write it up like a paper, but no. You're just putting points together for a PowerPoint presentation. You'll then record a video of yourself presenting the material -- it's you going over professional communication topics as if you're conducting an employee training session. They'll tell you to use Panopto. But use what you want, then upload it to Panopto to get the submission link. I do presentations professionally and would normally use PowerPoint, but I just used Canva for this. You can record yourself on a slide-by-slide basis. Super quick. Plenty of templates. Much less stressful than I thought it would be.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThere's not much here you really need. Just check the instructor videos if you're unclear about any task instructions. Even the instructor in the video tells you it's mostly just common sense stuff.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't have the rubrics with the scenarios you're assigned early, so there isn't a lot you can do. But you could go to the course search link again and find those instructor videos (check for a course resource document). Then you'll be clearer on what's coming.\\n\\n**C206 - Ethical Leadership (3 PAs)**\\n\\nProfessional ethics are important to me, so I enjoyed this class. I also work in the publishing space so I write and edit professionally in addition to consulting. So papers are a breeze. If you don't enjoy writing, or if it's slower for you, this might feel like a slog.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 requires you to complete an ethical lens inventory. I'm not sure if you can access this early. I didn't. You'll be given a scenario to base your paper on. You'll explore an ethical issue comparing two perspectives they give you. And you'll reflect on your ethical lens inventory.\\n\\nTask 2 will give you another scenario to work with. Your paper will be a report / ethics audit and suggestions for the company's future ethics training.\\n\\nTask 3 has you evaluate a real company's published code of ethics (they'll give you a company list to choose from). You analyze it. You make suggestions for improvement. Nothing too complex on this one.\\n\\n*Resources / Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nFor this one, you'll mostly have to wait until it's open. That's because there are different versions in the course search area, and you won't know what version you have until the rubrics and ethical lens inventory are available. You could still go to the course search area early, but there are two resource docs. In them, you could at least watch videos or slides about some of the basic concepts the papers will incorporate.\\n\\n**C207 - Data-Driven Decision Making (OA + 2 PAs)**\\n\\nReddit had me stressed about this one much more than I needed to be. Note: C215 builds on a lot of things in this class, so I highly recommend taking this first. I didn't, and it was my biggest regret. (I wanted what I thought would be math-heavy courses grouped together. This ended up not being a particularly math-heavy course.)\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nThere's an OA / exam for this one. Go through your resources. Understand the concepts. Have a calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. But I felt this OA was easier than people made it sound.\\n\\nThe first PA involves downloading an Excel spreadsheet, getting your data imported (they give it to you based on your student ID number, so it will differ between students), and letting Excel run data analysis. Then you'll write up a paper related to linear regression analysis.\\n\\nThe second PA is very similar. They give you all the data you need. But this one is about decision tree analysis.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFocus on the Resource document (in Course Tips if your class is open; under course search if it's not). They'll explain how to get the data analysis add-on you need in Excel. And there are task-specific resources that will guide you through the Excel analysis part if you aren't familiar with it. Scroll all the way down to a big link to a Panopto recording to run through questions for the OA. Do chapter quizzes and use the text to brush up on things you don't understand. There's a Jeopardy Review you might find helpful too. The resource doc isn't the best laid out for this course, but I focused on videos, slides, and taking notes. Look in a table for videos called MindEdge Module X Recording.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nGo watch those videos early and start studying for the OA. Resource doc is in the course search area. I know some prefer to do the PAs first. I did the OA first, and I felt that prepared me better for the papers.\\n\\n**C211 - Global Economics for Managers (OA)**\\n\\nPlenty of good resources for this one. This was my only non-exemplary OA, but I went through it extremely fast while I waited on IT to fix a problem locking up a tougher course I was working on. Made the mistake of changing answers because I second-guessed myself, and barely missed the cut-off as a result. Rarely a good idea to do that.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nJust an exam for this one. I did extremely well on the pre-assessment, and somehow did worse on the OA. Not sure I'd say they weren't reasonably well-aligned though. Just make sure you go through the competency list and make sure you're good in each area. Note: This was the shortest exam. Only around 50 questions. That means there's less room for mistakes, so keep that in mind.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nYou'll find a lot of keyword / glossary resources for this course. Use them! The instructor resources include a study guide (under course tips). It will help you outline your notes for the class and let you know exactly what concepts to focus in on. And there is a series of recorded cohorts you can watch. This was my primary resource.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nPrep for your pre-assessment by going to the course search link and finding the recorded cohorts to watch. You'll need to go pretty deep into the pages of links to find this one.\\n\\n**C212 - Marketing (PA)**\\n\\nThis course was the other one associated with my own specialty, so it was easy for me. I can't speak to what it will be like if you have no marketing experience. But this was one of the more interesting courses, or at least projects.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne paper. You'll essentially come up with a plan to take a company into a new global market with two new products. It's a bit weird in how it's set up -- your take a real or fictitious company based in the US, you're going to choose one country it doesn't operate in yet, and you're going to launch those in only the new international market. They give you a list of industries you can choose from, but in the video they say you can contact an instructor if you want to choose something outside of those. I went with a fictitious tech company based on a small real one currently outside the US. I was familiar enough with the real one's marketing and future plans that it helped me come up with new products that would satisfy real-world needs. Mine was a UK launch. You could choose Canada to keep it simple. It's actually pretty fun.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nThey provide a performance assessment template on the course resource document page. Use that. There's also an overview video to help you get started. I genuinely didn't use anything else for this one. If you see things in the rubric you don't understand, that's when the e-text might be helpful.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nJust go over the performance assessment video and access the template in the course search area. This was the second class I had opened, and I was able to completely write this PA and the 2 for C200 early and submit them all on Day 1. Not sure you can do that with all PAs, but if you really want a head start, these two courses work well for that.\\n\\n**C213 - Accounting for Decision Makers (OA)**\\n\\nThis one isn't bad, but it's likely the first class where you'll have any significant math to worry about. The good news is they give you all the formulas and financial ratios. They even give you the balance sheet and income statement structure. Some answers can be found right in the formula sheet, so refer to it often during the test. You'll want to know more than this, but make sure you have a good grasp of the accounting organizations, key legislation, financial ratios, the three main financial statements (balance sheets, income statements, and statement of cash flows), and really understand the three cash flow types (OPERATING -- day-to-day cash flows; INVESTMENT-- big purchases like land, buildings, vehicles, and equipment; FINANCING -- taking out or paying back loans, issuing or buying back stock, selling or paying on bonds... do NOT associate personal investments like stocks and bonds with the investment cash flows on accident!). No tough math on this one. If you can handle basic algebra (think solving for X) and you can follow the formulas they give you, you're good. No need to know the TVM functions on the financial calculator for this course.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. I found the OA and pre-assessment VERY similar. Pretty sure there were some identical questions. There were others that used similar or the same data sets but asked for slightly different things. If you do well on the pre-assessment, you should be fine for the OA. Start with the topics I mentioned above.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nFinally found out what the \"Hawaiian shirt guy\" videos were all about! lol These are short videos found inside the e-text. Watch them. They're funny (as funny as accounting can be). And they really do cover all the key points you'll want to take notes on and be familiar with.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou can't access the Hawaiian shirt guy videos until you can access the e-text. But go to the course search link (again, I know...) and you'll find slides and practice problems, and the resource document with some other video links to get familiar with the concepts and math.\\n\\n**C214 - Financial Management (OA)**\\n\\nHere it is. The beast of the bunch. lol Honestly, I didn't think it was as bad as people made it out to be. But again, I had some knowledge in this area (less than most other areas). I highly recommend taking this right after accounting. It builds very directly on some of those topics (like the different cash flow types and the financial statements). Get on it while that info is still fresh on your mind. It will also help with repetition to really help you retain more of it. This OA felt less aligned with the pre-assessment, but honestly, I found the OA easier rather than more difficult. But maybe it was just because I'd done lots of extra practice problems.\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nOne exam. Know your financial calculator inside and out! I recommend the TI BAii Plus. Know when to put it in beginning mode. Again, know the different types of cash flows you learned in C213. Practice the calculations like the bond yield to maturity and WACC ones. You'll be given formulas, but somehow I found these a little less helpful than the C213 ones. Still, you'll need them. Refer to them often. Even if you don't think you need them because something isn't a math problem, check them anyway! Sometimes they offer hints to questions that don't require calculations.\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nDr V's boot camp! Watch it once doing nothing but paying attention. Watch it again to take notes and run through problems with him on your calculator. Watch it a third time if you aren't comfortable. There are links in the resources document to two versions. Get the one recorded in May 2024 because he updated some things based on student feedback.\\n\\nThere are three longer cohort videos that are going to take a slower pace. They might be better if you like taking a lot of notes. Dr. V blitzes through it, but pretty much anything you need to know is in there. Just as important, find the spreadsheets! There are Excel files you can download. One is a concept quiz. Know it inside and out. I didn't use quizlet, but I know a lot of students swear by it. The concepts are vital for this OA, so drill them in until you truly understand them... don't just memorize definitions.\\n\\nThere's another Excel document with calculator walkthroughs. It shows you exactly what keys to hit when. Do this! Practice, practice, practice every math problem you can until you're comfortable with that calculator! There are two btw. If you use the BAii Plus, make sure you have the file for that calculator. Confused the heck out of me when I first found one talking about an HP calculator with some differences in the key setup.\\n\\nThere is a glossary in the instructor resources too. Use it. I promise, you'll want to know those things. You can find slides in there for the videos if you prefer to read the info. There's another video going over calculations (\"Ray's 58 minute calculation video). I found all the writing a bit distracting so I didn't really use this, but you certainly can. There are SO MANY resources for this course. It's a tough one, but the instructors really went out of their way to give you everything you need. I didn't touch the e-text at all. You can if you learn better that way. But don't sleep on any of the instructor resources, especially if you feel stuck.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nAgain, go to the course search area if your course resource document isn't open yet. You'll find it there. You'll find all the resources I mentioned there. There's a wealth of material you can go through ahead of time if you want to. You'll just need to be past orientation so you can access the \"preview\" course pages to find that.\\n\\n**C215 - Operations Management (OA)**\\n\\nThis was the second course where I had a little less experience (more in my early career), so it was tougher for me, but not difficult. There's a LOT of information to absorb, so take whatever time you need for that. I highly recommend taking this shortly after, if not immediately after, C207. There's a good bit of overlap, and I really wish I'd not taken this one as early as I did because taking C207 first would have made this so much easier!\\n\\n*Assessment:*\\n\\nThe exam was tougher than some others, but mostly due to the sheer volume of information you'll need to know. I can't even give you a topic list for this, because there's so much. Follow the competency guide, and really use your pre-assessment results to narrow down topics you'll want to focus on more. The info for this course will be very handy when working through your capstone! Oh, and there might be some math in this one, but it's not bad. Have your calculator and white board with you just in case you need them. For the formulas, it's more important to understand what each means (like how do you calculate productivity? Efficiency? etc.).\\n\\n*Resources:*\\n\\nIn the course resource document, you'll find a link to a separate page of instructor-led videos. Those are helpful. But honestly, I didn't watch all of them. Look for a document called C215 Material Review Guide. This is where it's at. You'll find the chapter slides, study guides, practice quiz links, flashcards if you like those (I don't), and pretty much everything you need. This is a rare case where I'll recommend an outside resource too -- go to Youtube and look for Dr. Haywood's Operations Management Full Course playlist. There are 40 videos I think, but they're VERY short. You don't need to watch them all. But if you aren't sure about a concept, these offer a different style of explanation that might suit you more, or if you're brushing up instead of learning from scratch, these make for a good refresher.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou know the drill by now. Click on the course search link. Browse around in there for the resources I mentioned above. Go to YouTube and watch those Dr. Haywood videos. If nothing else, you'll know what topics to dive into when you have access to the text.\\n\\n**C216 - MBA Capstone (3 PAs)**\\n\\nCheers to you if you made it this far! lol The capstone is fun! You'll take part in a simulation related to conscious capitalism (which means your success is about more than just profit; you'll want to consider things like employee happiness, safety issues, and environmental and community concerns as well). As mentioned earlier, I placed in the top 10% globally for the simulation, and I earned a capstone excellence award. Another student mentioned you'll need a score of 50+ on your cumulative balanced scorecard to be eligible for the award, so you might want to keep that goal in mind.\\n\\n*Simulation Tips:*\\n\\nI'm not going to give any tips regarding specific decisions, but I'll offer some general tips that might help.\\n\\nI highly recommend spending extra time on Q1 so you can thoroughly learn the platform. There's a lot of information in there, and you don't want to miss any key decisions.\\n\\nSpend extra time on Q4 too. There will be some new things introduced that you don't want to miss (like R&D that will let you improve your products in the following quarters).\\n\\nWhen you finish filling out Q4, do NOT submit it! You'll need to export your tactical plan and manually make estimates for Q5 and Q6. These estimates don't have to be accurate. They should simply make sense based on your past quarters and what you hope to do in the next two. You'll use this tactical plan to work on Task 1. After you submit Task 1, immediately submit Q4 in the simulation. Do NOT make any further changes to it before submitting.\\n\\nRemember to keep an eye on competitor data. For example, if your ads aren't rated well, see which competitors' are. I don't recommend copying what they do, but rather see where theirs might have room for improvement, then execute that in your own and see how they perform the following quarter.\\n\\nWhen you pass Task 1, Q5 and Q6 will open. You'll continue, following your tactical plan (or not if you change your mind!). When you submit Q6, it's over! You'll see Q7 pop up with your final performance reports. You'll also see on the bottom left a link saying \"claim your certification.\" If you want these badges (save them to Badgr or something similar), get them before you apply for graduation and get locked out. There are 3 possible ones as far as I know: certificate of completion, 1st place team, and top 10% worldwide. I got all 3 of those, but I do not know if there are others. Hopefully someone else can weigh in if they got something different.\\n\\nRemember at every step of the way that this is about shareholder value and conscious capitalism. Shareholder value is NOT just profit. Your company's reputation and employee satisfaction will also have an impact.\\n\\n*Assessments:*\\n\\nTask 1 is a presentation (PowerPoint and video) where you'll pitch venture capitalists trying to secure an investment. You'll submit your slides, your video version, and your presenter notes. Remember to submit Q4 as soon as you submit Task 1. This will lock down your simulation until you pass Task 1. For presenter notes, you can write them up after your video is recorded. I opted to script mine and semi-read it for the video, using the script as my presenter notes. Do what's more comfortable for you and just try to talk about your decisions and their results in a natural way. You'll present progress info and plans for future quarters.\\n\\nTask 2 is a stockholder report. I found this the most difficult paper of the program, but it was the last one I wrote, so I was also likely anxious to get it done which made it feel longer. Still, I wrote it in no more than 4 hours. Your mileage may vary. I included a LOT of charts, graphs, and other screenshots from the simulation in mine. The rubric feels a little more complex, so review is CAREFULLY, and REPEATEDLY until you're 100% certain you've covered everything. I highly recommend prepping your screenshots after reviewing the rubric. It would have been nice not hopping in and out of the paper to do this, as I liked having them in the document while writing certain sections. It'll also cut your stress over the page count, because those will beef it up quite a bit as you go.\\n\\nTask 3 is a more personal reflection. You'll need to update your resume, update your LinkedIn profile and export it as a .pdf, and upload 3 academic or professional artifacts. I used my Bachelor's degree diploma in my main specialty area, an article I wrote related to ethical AI use in my industry (which I tied to a C206 competency), and a magazine article showcasing one of my digital properties as a top resource in its industry. You choose from a lot of things. If you have any awards or certifications, those work. Something you've written. A presentation you put together (I don't see why you couldn't use your presentation from C204). A positive evaluation you received. Documentation of a professional membership. Pick things that make sense based on the competencies you highlight in the paper you'll write.\\n\\n*Pre-Game Plan:*\\n\\nYou won't be able to get ahead on Task 1 and Task 2 much because you won't have access to the simulation. But go into the course search area and you'll find some resources to get you ready. For example, there's a document to help explain the tactical plan that will serve as the basis for Task 1. And you'll find a document on artifacts you can use in Task 3. There's also an introductory video to explain the simulation. Perhaps the best way to speed things up though is not to wait when you submit Task 1 for evaluation. Move right along, but with Task 3. You can finish that before moving on with the simulation. Just don't submit it! You're supposed to submit Task 2 first. I finished editing Task 3 just as my Task 1 evaluation came back. So I immediately did the last two quarters that evening, wrote Task 2 the next morning, then submitted Task 2, followed quickly by Task 3. The final two tasks were graded by the time I was getting ready for bed that night! Overall, evaluations for the capstone went pretty quickly.\\n\\nOK. I know that's a LOT to digest! If you have questions, feel free to ask, but I won't give any specific information about rubrics, exams, etc. Just resources or more general advice to help you get through certain things you might be curious about or struggling with.\\n\\nGood luck all!  \n",

I transferred 50 credits and work full time (Non IT). Here are my thoughts. Very long read!\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[Proof of Completion](https://preview.redd.it/4372ewij6r5b1.jpg?width=1026&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b92d9611f3e8c135bf5b9ea582ef9d423b96d820)\\n\\n[Completed Progress Schedule](https://preview.redd.it/kcx3uvij6r5b1.jpg?width=1921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=82c94084e66ec02294d3990bcebe5cc3bfd4c42a)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n  \\n\\nFirst and foremost, there are a lot of grammatical errors in this. I know. I do not care because I’m too lazy to proof read and fix them.\\n\\nAnyways I finished this degree program in a little over 3 months (105 days to be exact) after transferring about 50 credits. I also work full time with some fairly demanding hours. I do not have any professional IT work experience, but I can navigate around a computer. I also just find the subject matter interesting. I did do the computer science program last year and graduated from that in 1 term in August of 2022. My plan was to go to grad school in Spring of 2023, but I ended up missing all my deadlines and had to wait and apply for Summer/Fall Semester of 2023. I did end up getting accepted to University of Illinois (Urbana Campus) Masters in Computer Science (Data Science Track) for Fall of 2023…which was a shocker because it’s a Top 5 school for computer science. Data science has always been my main goal, but I had all this time in between from when I applied to when the Fall semester would start. Cybersecurity was always on my list of things to learn, but I always had other priorities. Now that I had this gap of time that I could do whatever with, it was a good time for me to get into it. I originally thought about going the route of just doing certs because I already have a CS degree, but I would have just mostly done the same certs that WGU offers in their Cybersecurity program. It would have cost a little less than the actual degree, but still roughly in the same ball park if done in 1 term. Considering that I would be attaining the same certs anyways and the cost is comparable, I figure I might as well do the program and get the degree out of it as well, even though I would likely never use the degree on my resume (with exceptions) as CS “trumps” Cybersecurity. At the least, it helped me stay on track and in focus. I gotta be honest, I enjoyed it alot more than I did computer science and it really got me questioning what path I want to take in my future. I’m still going to grad school (it was a miracle that I even got excepted there), but I may defer to next year (University of Illinois allows that) as I’m thinking I want to take Cyber Security further and dive into different areas. Below is a recap of classes that may or may not help you.\\n\\nHowever, before I get into it, I would just like to point out that I have been working in the construction project management field for the last decade after I finished my first stint (of many) in college (civil engineering). Needless to say, those who are in the engineering/construction field live and die by the schedule so I have a habit of making a schedule for every significant (sometimes insignificant) things I do. I included the schedule I made for this program. I started in March and assigned myself durations to complete the entire program within 1 term and giving myself more weight to what classes I thought would be more demanding and vise-versa. This is the schedule that I would live by and you can see I was on track until I did my 4th class (Networks D325) which is when I started accelerating like crazy. The durations shown are my actuals and the grey bars you see in the gantt chart is my baseline schedule snapshot of what my original schedule was when I first made it. You can compare the 2 and see how much I blew my original schedule out of the water. Most of the classes were done much quicker than my projection. Capstone was the only one that took longer (only by 4 days). Seeing a visual of your progress helps keep you on track and is a motivating factor. I would suggest everyone put a schedule together of some sort.\\n\\n**IT Foundations – D316 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I never had a job in IT, I just grew up using a computer just like everyone else in this program. I felt alot of these questions were really basic questions and if you know your way around a computer you can probably answer most of them without heavy studying. That being said, even though it is a basic certification, I feel like I actually got alot out this course as it made me touch on things that I wouldn’t have otherwise yet is still good to know…things like differences between cpu architecture and differences in memory types, etc… stuff you don’t normally think about. I found those things to be quite interesting. The only PBQ I remember was having to simulate putting together 2 desktops, one being high performance and one being for general office use, you have to pick the right components for each desktop based on the parameters in the question. For studying I partially watched the Total Seminar Series to fill in gaps and did a few Messer practice exams. I also did practice questions from crucialexams dot com. That is one of my favorite resources. Check that site out if you do not already know about it. That was all that was needed.\\n\\n**IT Applications – D317 (17 Days…I didn’t actually spend 17 days on this course, I was inactive for 10 days)**\\n\\n\\- Part 2 of the A+ exam. I have a similar view to how I viewed “IT Foundations” (Part 1 of A+ exam). About the same difficulty as Part 1. However, alot of it seemed like it was common sense considering you didn’t just start using a computer yesterday. Many of the questions you can come up with the right answer by just logically using process of elimination. On my particular exam, it was heavy on questions regarding system tools and commands. Those were the things you are really going to want to pay attention to study for. For studying, I mainly only watched the Total Seminar Series and did some Professor Messer exams and crucial exams.\\n\\n**Legal Issues in Information Security – C841 (10 Days…had 1 revision to do)**\\n\\n\\- I didn’t read any course material. I just read what the assignment was and used outside resources to learn and fill any gaps that I had to complete the assignment. This is one of those classes where you get out what you put in. I had no interest in this class whatsoever and I just blew through the assignment in a few days. I could have certainly spent longer time and get in depth with the course material, but it just was not important to me and I opted to just get this class done as fast as possible. It is a very easy class if you want it to be.\\n\\n**Networks – D325 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Of all classes, this was one the most demanding for me and the most important. Networking is the foundation to everything in this program and it would behoove you take as much time needed to understand the concepts. I would encourage all of you to build some sort of homelab which can be done dirt cheap. Exam wise, it was difficult because of all the acronyms you need to remember which makes it unnecessarily difficult, but the questions themselves were not tricky and fairly straightforward except the PBQs which are nonsensical in how they are asked. In my PBQs I was asked to set up/configure a network and WIFI and was also asked to troubleshoot a network. The questions were pretty comprehensive across the board and there were a few questions on port numbers, OSI model questions (know what layer does what and what types of programs or hardware pertains to each layer), network topography, wireless standards and a bunch of questions on various plans/policies and a bunch of questions on command line utilities (learn these!). I also had maybe 3 questions on CIDR notation, but I did not have to compute anything. Again, know your acronyms! For this test, I watched the total seminar series, practice exams on crucial exams, a couple of Dion practice exams (only partially) and referenced Mike Meyers’ CompTIA Network+ Certification Passport Book. I really liked this book. His “all in one” book goes more in depth (I have it but didn’t read it much), but the Certification Passport book was much better to look up a topic and briefly read about it when going over things you need to go over. Watching the video series and then using this book as a backup was all I really needed. I did a few quick reviews on crucial exams to build some confidence.\\n\\n**Emerging Technologies in Cybersecurity – C844 (3 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read any course material, I just went straight to the assignment and chipped away at it all day. I thought this class was useful as it gave you an introductory on how to use Wireshark and Nmap. Wireshark is a very cool program. Lots of features to analyze traffic. I did not read the course material for this class as the Nmap portion was easy to figure out without having to really look anything up, but for the Wireshark portion, I only watched the Udemy course: “Getting Started with Wireshark: The Ultimate Hands-On Course” by David Bombal. Excellent course and will provide you with all you need. This guy is very passionate about his Wireshark! I highly recommend this Udemy course and get as much as you can out of it. There are others, but this one was the best one that I was able to come across.\\n\\n**Network and Security - Applications – D329 (7 Days)**\\n\\n\\- This class is the class that requires the Security+. I found this exam to be fairly easy because there is a lot of overlap from Network+. Just like Network+ there is a lot of memorization of acronyms needed. I apologize as I don’t have much to offer on this because I don’t remember the specifics of what was on it. It is just kind of one big blur. I remember it being shockingly easy compared to Network+ like if you passed Network+ you could probably take this the next day and pass it after reviewing all the common types of attacks. For studying, I just watched the Security+ course on udemy by TIA Education, Andrew Ramdayal. He was actually pretty good, straight to the point on topics with no fluff. Probably not everyone’s “cup of tea”. Also, probably could have gone a little more in depth in some areas, but I would take this over Dion Training any day. Hell, I would take anything over Dion Training. Ramdayal strictly sticks to the objectives laid out exactly the way Comptia has their test laid out. It was easy to goto each one and pick the things you need to work on. I did no practice exams. Went straight to the official exam after I finished the video series. I do remember that one of the PBQs was setting up a firewall.\\n\\n**Digital Forensics in Cybersecurity – D431 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I did not read the course material, I just went straight to the assignment and used outside resources and Udemy to guide me. I actually found this course to be quite fun. You will have (2) PAs and an OA to do. The first PA is that you have to create an investigation plan per best practices. The 2nd PA was fun as you will need to run a program called “Autopsy”, where you have to analyze a disk image and put a story together about what crime will likely be committed based on the evidence you found when doing your forensics. As far as the OA goes, know your tools, Windows/Linux/Mac log types and folder locations, what different parts of your Windows registry does and the various Federal Laws (critical). The preassessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty and style. That was really the only study aid I used.\\n\\n**Information Systems Security – C845 (10 Days)**\\n\\nYou will need to pass your SSCP for this one. I wrote a post on this class before. However here is a brief TLDR recap from my previous post on couple of things for you to remember:\\n\\n\\- The SSCP Practice Exam Book by Nick Mitropoulous is a fairly good representation of the exam and is the only thing I used.\\n\\n\\- This was an easier version of Security+. If you passed A+, Net+ and Sec+ than this exam will be fairly easy.\\n\\n\\- questions seem to be spread out evenly across the board for the most part, with the exception that there were very few questions on “cryptography” (I had maybe 5 or 6 that I can remember), but there were seemingly a bunch of questions regarding “identity access”. They weren’t difficult, but that section definitely had the most weight. Be sure you know the concepts behind the “who I am”, “what I know”, “what I have” principles as there were a lot of questions on that.\\n\\n\\- There were no trick questions and you don’t have to worry about remembering acronyms\\n\\n\\- Don’t psych yourself out. The most obvious answers are like the correct answers. There were no trick questions.\\n\\n\\- This is very important, read the question very carefully and really think about your answer when it comes to the “best”, “worst” and “most likely/unlikely” questions. These questions have multiple right answers so they can be kind of difficult. You have to consider how you are answering that question because you will get questions like “What is the best course of action in this (insert scenario)? Choose: A, B, C or D. Lets say the answer “A” and “B” are both definitely correct in the scenario, but choice “B” might be a step that you would do in part of step described in choice “A”. So the answer would be “A”. These are not trick questions, but you really need to think how answers integrate with others to pick the best choice. These questions were probably the most “trickiest”, but if you know to look out for them and think logically, you will be ok\\n\\n**Introduction to Cryptography – D334 (8 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed my first OA attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. Lots of memorization in this class. Just like all the other threads you will see about this course. Shawn’s Course Study Guide/Notes found in course chatter is all you need. The book is ok, but is pretty dry. Shawn did a very good job on his study guide. Its all you need! Get familiar with that and then do his practice exams for each chapter. You will pass. The PA and his practice exams were pretty close to the OA in terms of difficulty and style of question. Lots of memorization. I’m probably in the minority here, but I thought the subject matter was very interesting. I think about this stuff when I download programs and visit websites and stuff. It only took me about a week to finish this class, but I got pretty immersed in it. The concept of cryptography is pretty much engrained in me. Regarding the exam, questions seemed to be more skewed towards PKI, Wireless Encryption Protocols and Tunneling. These seem to show up the most on my exam and there were very few questions on blockchain/crypto currency and lightweight cryptography. The rest of the topics were pretty evenly distributed. It was a good introductory course in my opinion.\\n\\n**Managing Information Security – C843 (4 Days)**\\n\\n\\- Didn’t read any course material. Just read and did the assignment. You will need to do an incident analysis and response as well as a risk assessment. There is a lot of crap you are going to have to discuss and write about, such as legal acts, tools, techniques for gathering and analyzing, examination process etc…. It’s a very annoying assignment. I did not care for it in the slightest.\\n\\n**Cyber Defense and Countermeasures – D340 (5 Days)**\\n\\n\\- The CYSA+ is required for this class. WGU is enforcing a policy where accelerators can only have one class approved at a time and the program must be taken in a specific order….atleast that is what my mentor told me and won’t budge on it. The reason I’m mentioning this is because the order in which they have you do classes makes sense and does a good job preparing you systematically in my opinion. Every class builds on each other and the time you are required to take the CYSA+ is the right time. That being said, I felt the CYSA+ is a much harder version of the Security+. It went much deeper in security concepts compared to the Sec+ and I found some aspects of it to be rather difficult. However, all the Comptia exams you have taken so far preps you for the CYSA+. The cryptography class taken before this class, covers most of the cryptography questions on this exam. The digital forensics course that we have to take before this was sufficient enough to not have to do in depth studying for this exam. For studying, I just blew through the Total Seminar CYSA+ Series on Udemy and did a quick run through with things I was not familiar with the CYSA+ Certification Passport Book by Bobby Rogers. I did not do any practice exams. My lack of study was due to me being over confident. The PBQs were fun though. From what I remember, they all had to do with using nmap to determine what specific servers did and log trouble shooting. That was pretty much the gist of all the PBQs. They were pretty straight forward. <750 is considered a fail…I passed with a 751 on the first attempt. Probably should have done some practice exams to get that score up a little. Pass is a pass!\\n\\n**Managing Cloud Security – D320 (6 Days)**\\n\\n\\- I failed this OA by a slim margin the first attempt and took the 2nd attempt 2 days later. The instructor for this course was a relief because he just let me do it after I told him I reviewed the book the previous day. Normally they make you do a bulls\\\\\\*\\\\\\*t generic study plan and make you jump through a bunch hoops. Apparently the course was redone and a new exam had been made following the CCSP text book. This test was a doozy as there are 125 questions. However, just going over the book is sufficient. It was for me anyways. A lot of it will be a review which makes studying quite quick. It followed the book quite nicely. There were no curve balls and the questions were pretty straight forward. I’d probably say that the most sh\\\\\\*tty thing was having to memorize the various laws and frameworks. This is a must! You also need to make sure you are familiar with all the different frameworks and standards, quantitative risk assessment, uptime institute, data lifecycle, SOC report types, Software Development Lifecycle and Stride Threat Model.\\n\\n**Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Analysis – D332 (12 Days)**\\n\\n\\* This is taken from a previous post I made after I finished this class. Im reposting it here so you don’t have to search for it.\\*\\n\\n\\- By far the most difficult exam in my opinion. This was the only Comptia test that I failed the first time. All the Comptia exams kind of built off the previous and you could make your way around the exams without feeling completely lost. Pentest+ was different, the previous exams will help you very little. The things you really have to know are the commonly used tools and what they do. There is a lot of them and there are bunch of questions like “which tool would use for this?”. NMAP commands and syntax (very heavy in this), SQL Injection/XSS types and deciphering vulnerability logs. Make sure you have a semi decent grasp on SQL in general. ALL the different types of attacks that are commonly used. There are some that came up that I did not come across in the book. If you know the main/commonly used ones, you should be ok for the most part. Learn scripting! You will not need to write any per se, but you might as well learn because there are questions where you need to decipher/interpret various scripts and therefore need to know how to write them. Make sure you know the different syntax. For example, know how an array is written in PowerShell (there is a question in the exam where you will need to figure this out). Learn the common commands for PS, Bash and Linux. There was a couple questions having to do with common HTTP methods. There were not really any questions regarding the different laws. Definitely do not need to focus on that. You should know them anyways if you had just done the Managing Cloud class. The PBQs were medium difficulty. From what I remember, they were as follows (in no particular order):\\n\\n1. Mix and match: You will get like a single line of script (or payloads rather) and you have to pick what kind of vulnerability it is and then you need to pick a method of remediation. Need to know your scripting and various types of SQL injection. This is critical. There will be like (10) of these you have to do.\\n\\n2. Scripting: On the right, there will be a block of incomplete scripting. On the left, you will have multiple options of code snippets that you will need to use to plug into the incomplete areas of the code. The code is prewritten for you. You just need to place the right snippet in the correct blank spot where the code is incomplete. There are twice as many code snippets then there are blank spots so you can’t just use the process of elimination. You kind of have to have some sort of clue. Also, the code might be in Bash, Python or Ruby. You have to be able to tell the difference.\\n\\n3. NMAP Interpretation: You will get a block of an NMAP scan result. Like above, you will have a bunch of options on the right hand side. You will be asked to put together the correct NMAP command to get the results shown in the scan output. Part 2 is that you will need to also pick the trouble areas (attack vectors) based on what the scan shows. There will be a list of options for you to choose from.\\n\\n4. Investigate Login Page: You will be given a login page of which you can view the certificate, source code and cookies. You will need to determine if any of those 3 things have issues. If they do, you will need to specify and provide a solution.\\n\\nThe Sybex book is by far the best book for this course. I did not care for the Sybex books in the other courses. Finding a good video series was difficult. I’m a total seminars fan, but this one did not do it for me. I hate the Dion materials in general and I’ve tried others on Udemy and Youtube and none of them were doing it for me. Another great book is Pentest+ for dummies. Very engaging. Lastly, you must spend time and do labs to understand the concepts. You’re really shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t. Look into tryhackmeDOTcom as well. I took the exam 3 days after registering for the class after a quick review. I thought I would be ok and I wanted to quickly get it over with. I found out in the first 10 questions and the PBQs that I was very underprepared. I took the test again a week later after intense studying and passed.\\n\\n**IT Capstone Written Project – C769 (9 Days)**\\n\\nEh, it is what it is. A bunch of busy work. No need to reinvent the wheel. Take a look in WGUs database that has\\n\\nall the previous capstones that were rewarded for “excellence” and look at them for inspiration, ideas and see how they put theirs together. There is also a dedicated capstone page that will provide templates and samples for you so you will not be totally lost. I chose to propose implementing an “Insider Threat Management System” for a pharmaceutical company based on a scenario that I made up. There are 3 parts to the capstone: submitting what you will propose, writing the actual proposal and writing a post implementation report/reflection. None of it is difficult, it is just time consuming as they are asking for you to include a lot of stuff. 70% of part 3 is going to ask you for the same thing in part 2. I literally just cut and pasted the applicable sections from part 2 and changed the wording to past tense as part 3 is supposed to occur after you implemented your system. There will be a portion where you have to use outside references and cite books or whatever…just goto researchgateDOTcom query whatever subject you’re doing, pick however many you need from the search results that pertain and just read the abstracts and tie them into your proposal and cite them (already provided when you select a paper to view). This should save you some time. You are also going to need to turn in some sort of “deliverable” whether it be code sample, UML diagrams, operations manual, etc… I would suggest just doing a simple process diagram and explain each process. Its quick and easy and satisfies that requirement. If you goto apps dot diagrams dot net, you can build a nice one for free. If you want to be ultra creative and spend all your time doing the capstone on some crazy and innovative idea, all good. However, I would suggest you put in the bare minimum effort and move on, finish this program and get started on your new career asap. I WOULD NOT put any effort into this capstone! WGU doesn’t require it (they are just looking that you have all the things in their rubric). This project is not beneficial in any way and its not like you would be using it for a portfolio or anything. Do not waste your time on it. Read the requirements make sure you include those requirements and go.\\n\\n**List of exams from least difficult to most difficult:**\\n\\n1. A+ part 2\\n\\n2. A+ part 1\\n\\n3. SSCP\\n\\n4. Intro to Cryptography OA (Not difficult, but lots of memorization)\\n\\n5. Security+\\n\\n6. Managing Cloud Security OA (Due to amount of questions and material needed to go over)\\n\\n7. CYSA+\\n\\n8. Network+ (Information overload and acronyms galore!)\\n\\n9. Pentest+ (read review!)\\n\\n\\*I am awaiting to take the CCSP. I will be taking it in 2 weeks. I do not know how difficult it will be. Can’t be that hard. I’ll provide a writeup when I do take it\\*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2 things that may or may not help you…**\\n\\n1. There is a lot of information on the internet about how to study. Reading the text book through and through and taking notes is not efficient nor is it the best way and it is what is called “passive learning”. It is more efficient to do active learning. Which means…well…do active things when you’re learning…flash cards, practice exams, simulate teaching the material, physical home lab, etc…\\n\\nWhen it comes to studying especially for exams, my normal study habit is to watch a video series on 2x the speed or the fastest it can be where I can clearly understand it. You are trying to get an overview and have familiarity with everything. The video is visual and helps things stick. You’ll be surprised how much you can pick up. I will not take notes, just jot down questions of things I need to go over as they come up while I am watching. When Im done with the series, I will then look those question topics up and determine the what, why, and how of it to understand that particular topic/concept. Then I will generally do a practice exam, note question topics that I am not familiar with to look up when done. I will also go over the questions missed and then repeat then go over the same or another practice exam. It doesn’t matter if the test is not that similar in style/difficulty to what you are taking if you take the time to understand the concept. Comprehensive practice exams is my preference but anything that is “active” is good. You will figure out what works best for you. Just don’t read a book front to back, take notes in between and try to memorize it unless you like being inefficient and wasting your time…unless that is what is best for you. Lol\\n\\n2. Most of you already know this, but ChatGPT is your friend! By far the most valuable tool for me. It can be abused or it can be used as an extremely well-functioning learning tool. You are only hurting yourself if you want to try and use it for other purposes. When I would study my material and need to understand a topic like OSI models for example, I would write something like “Explain to me like a child what the OSI layers are and what they do. Also provide me an analogy.”. I cannot tell you how easy it was for me to pick things up when Chatgpt was able to explain things to me like im a 5 year old and provide me an easy to understand analogy. Analogies was a game changer for me. If you still don’t understand, you can have full conversations with it and ask it questions until you do understand it. Something like “I don’t understand, why would it do \\\\\\*this when it seems to do \\*that? You said \\*this. What is difference between \\*this and \\*that?”! Like full on conversations. Try it right now and see what I’m talking about! Use it to your advantage for learning. It is an amazing resource! Word of caution though, it is not always right depending on what you are asking or telling it what to do so when in doubt verify it.\\n\\n**My thoughts overall:**\\n\\nI know what some of you are thinking: “ MmMMMmGoOoOo! BuT, bUt, BuT, YoU JuSt RuShEd ThRoUgH iT aNd DiD NoT LeArN AnyThInG! mMmGoOoOoOo!”. I learned the amount of material I needed to learn to get through the entire program and have probably come out with just as much as everyone else who graduated regardless of time spent. More than others in some cases. I also feel like I have a gotten a very solid foundation out of it, which was my expectation. \\n\\nHere is the thing, I would rather blow through the program and pay minimum tuition of $4k (plus get all my bonus certs!), continue learning and fill in gaps after completion at my leisure vs taking my sweet time and pump out the program in 3-4 terms and pay $12k-$16k. I guarantee I will have far surpassed that person’s knowledge on an intellectual and practical level by the time he/she is done. My learning will never stop, but my tuition will as soon as I can make it stop! Time is money. Massive acceleration is the way to go if it can be done…in my opinion. That is the beauty of WGU.\\n\\nThat being said, I feel like I’m just beginning, in that I’ve only dipped my toe and now the real learning begins. Now that I have the time and am not at the mercy of my term date lest I pay another 4k, I will go back and fill in my gaps and really start doing real world practical stuff and labs that I did not do. I did build a pretty intricate homelab that I will be using heavily. Anyways, I feel like this program did an excellent job in providing a solid foundation and I do mean excellent. I do not regret it in any way and I am in many ways more excited about this then I was with the Computer Science degree. That’s all I got. Good luck to you all! If you have any questions do not hesitate to ask me.  \n",

Review of all classes.\\nThere are others that have made this post, but I think it would be helpful if people gave context to who they are and their level of proficiencies so that others can more accurately predict how the experience will go for them.\\n\\n  \\n**Who I am:**\\n\\n*  Early 30s male\\n* Wife and kid (toddler)\\n* Working full time while doing the degree in an unrelated field (High school AP physics teacher)\\n* No prior work experience in the tech field\\n* Did a Udemy course about 2 months before enrollment, which taught basic programming (Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python... and I did about 20 days of that and had never coded before)\\n* Have always had a strong interest in tech and computers as a USER. Built my own custom gaming PC and in my childhood knew how to torrent pirated movies and games and how to follow tutorials to crack software without having any clue of what I was actually doing.\\n* ADHD, unmedicated but have always seemed to cope fine.\\n* Prior STEM bachelors degree from a top 40 college. Masters degree in education.\\n* I REALLY like math and logic, hence I teach AP Physics.\\n* I don't mind reading textbooks (mostly skimming) and always have had a knack for test taking.\\n\\n**How long it took me and how hard I studied:**\\n\\n* 2 years (4 terms total) although I probably could have done it in 1.5 if I didn't slack so hard in my 3rd term\\n* 8-10 hours a week studying. Some weeks it was 1-2 hours a night on the weekdays, other weeks I might do a burst of 3-4 hours on the weekends.\\n* I used ChatGPT to reinforce my studying. I'd often reexplain concepts to it and asked if I was being accurate. I did not use it to write any code, but would use it to help clean and debug my code if I was having issues. It's also very useful for quick questions like \"How do make a list out of just the values of this dictionary again?\" I never used it to write my papers for me, but might use it to bounce ideas off of before I started. I always used the PAID models to ensure I got better outputs. I started out paying $20 per month for ChatGPT Plus and eventually just learned how to use API keys so that I could access both ChatGPT and Claude for WAY cheaper through a chat client.\\n* I very infrequently met with course instructors. Instead, I might send an email if I need any clarifying questions. I didn't join the discord or anything. Guides on this subreddit were OKAY for some courses, but bad for others.\\n* I didn't do any of the acceleration tricks like taking the practice tests first thing. Almost every class, I just opened it up, started working through the textbook or study guide posted by the instructor, and then took the tests once I finished.\\n\\n**What are my next steps?**\\n\\nHonestly if the market was better, I'd be more aggressively applying. With all my other responsibilities, I never did an internship. By the time I felt ready for an internship anyways I was blazing through my last term because I left a lot of coding classes until the end.\\n\\n  \\nI'm currently grinding leetcode and that's been fun. I'll probably start applying to jobs in a few months but will continue teaching this upcoming school year.\\n\\n  \\nI did apply to GTech's OMSCS program. I figured I'll continue learning while job searching and can pause it if I land anything that I want. The problem is that I am already making a good amount of money ($115k /year) teaching, so I feel like I get to be picky. Maybe I'll do an internship next summer while I'm still doing the OMSCS program.\\n\\n  \\nIf I never transition out of teaching, that's okay too. This program has been fun and I really value knowledge in general. I can build apps to help automate my job and can also teach my students some programming too if I'd like.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Overall thoughts:**\\n\\nThis is a good CS program in that it is HARD. Nobody finishes this program and thinks that it is comparable at all to a boot camp. You thoroughly have to learn most of the things you would at a traditional CS program, like architecture, OS, machine learning, DSA, discrete math, etc. If anybody is looking at this program as an easy way to get a CS degree, you're going to be disappointed. **It's not easy. It's just really convenient.**\\n\\n  \\nThere are some things missing that I wished was included, like linear algebra and a larger focus on advanced statistics. The difficulty of the courses are all over the place. Many of the courses are laughably easy, but the same can be said of many of my classes from my top 40 STEM degree. Some of these classes are so ridiculously hard, I seriously estimate that a big chunk of students drop out when they hit them and are humbled by how hard the degree is (DM2, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, DSA2, Java Frameworks/Backend).\\n\\n  \\nMy overall opinion is somewhat mixed actually and leaning on the positive side. The program felt way easier than my first STEM bachelors, but maybe it's because I'm older and have a better work ethic. When I talk to my own former students who have finished or are in traditional CS programs at good schools, I can't help but feel like the WGU program might be on the easier side just based off of the description of what they're learning compared to what I'm learning. At the same time, people talk about how some folks get CS degrees from well known schools and come out being able to barely code or explain how computers work, and I CANNOT imagine that to be true of anybody that finishes the WGU program. It's extremely difficult to fake it through a lot of these courses because of the way the tests are proctored.\\n\\n  \\nIt's an unpopular opinion, but I'm glad the hardest classes are as hard as they are. It'll gatekeep the graduates of this program so that anybody that holds this degree will actually know their stuff when they get employed. If the program was easy to get through, you'd get a bunch of terrible graduates giving managers all over the world a bad outlook on the school. Instead, by keeping the program difficult to pass, it somewhat ensures that once any of us get hired, the school might get a positive reputation for cranking out capable individuals who can self-learn and self-manage properly.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Alright enough! Just tell me about the classes**\\n\\nI transferred in all my gen eds. I didn't do any of those Sophia/Straighterline/Saylor classes or anything.\\n\\n  \\nHere are my thoughts on each class in the order I took them:\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 1:**\\n\\nC182 Introduction to IT - Pretty easy. Clicked through all of the pages in about 3 hours total and took the test later that night. I think it does a good job giving you a preview of CS content so that you can decide yourself if this is the program for you. If you read the material and go \"wow that is SO boring,\" well the bad news is you're gonna burn out of this program because that's what you'll be learning for the rest of the program.\\n\\n  \\nC958 Calculus I - Super easy. I took AP Calculus in high school and then again in college 15 years ago. Didn't take math higher than that, but I do teach physics for a living, so these ideas are part of my every day life. I used Khan Academy's Calc AB course and reviewed it over the course of a week. There's a few lessons in the Calc BC course that you need to do for integration by parts, but it wasn't bad. Buy yourself a TI-84 and learn how to use it. Use YouTube tutorials to teach yourself how to solve certain problems. There's very little that the calculator can't do. Aced the test.\\n\\n  \\nC172 Network and Security Foundations - Also really easy, but sort of a chore to get through. I just read the material. I found people's recommended playlists to not be deep enough and took longer than just skimming the actual material. Aced the test after 2 weeks of reading. I probably should have taken notes though.\\n\\n  \\nC836 Fundamentals of Information Security - Take this right after the C172 Network and Security Foundations class. There's a lot of overlap. This isn't a traditional textbook and is actually just a book about Network Security, so it reads a bit differently than a textbook. It's another 2 weeks of reading essentially. I think at this point, a student might find themselves either really interested in this stuff or not. If you are, you might as well switch to cybersecurity because that's what these two courses introduce.\\n\\n  \\nC173 Scripting and Programming Foundations - Super easy if you already know coding basics. You don't even use a real language here, it's just pseudocode using something called Coral. Goes over things like if/else branches, for/while loops, variables, definitions, etc. but in a basic way. This class is for people who have NEVER coded before. Everyone else will be able to pass this class in less than a week of just reviewing over the material.\\n\\n\\n\\nC779 Web Development Foundations - Dude I freaking hated this class. HTML and CSS and those languages are just NOT fun for me. You're just essentially memorizing what different tags do and making sure you know the syntax for it. I also made the mistake of thinking \"hey why don't I just do a udemy course on HTML or web dev?\" Ended up wasting so much time on it. Probably could have just read the book, taken notes, and passed over the course of a few weeks. Instead this class took me like 2 months because I was just not using my time wisely and also go busy in my normal life. Don't know if I actually hate HTML/CSS or if I just have a bad taste because of my experience in this class (which was totally my own doing).\\n\\n  \\nC959 Discrete Math I - Ahhhhh the first class that felt worthy to me. I actually love this stuff. It comes naturally if you're good at logic, but even then there's a good amount of information, most of which you probably have never encountered. This class really feels like you're learning a ton of NEW information that you've never seen before, whereas a lot of the stuff prior to this is stuff that you're sort of familiar with (like routers and PCs and stuff). I liked this class a lot. I know people hate math, but if you're like me and like math, you'll enjoy this class. It took me a 6 weeks and I didn't miss a single question on the test.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 2:**\\n\\nC867 Scripting and Programming Applications - Another great class. This class is C++ and if it's your first foray into real coding, it might take awhile. I enjoyed going through the textbook and doing the built in exercises (mini easy leetcode problems) while learning the language, which can be daunting compared to python since it's more verbose. The project is sort of cool (not portfolio worthy though) and introduces you to C++ specific techniques like using pointers and deallocating memory when you code with objects. This course will teach you OOP if you've never done it before. This course took me about 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC175 Data Management Foundations - The first of three SQL classes. Honestly the data classes made me seriously consider a career in data engineering or management. SQL is fun and I had no idea what it was before. My biggest advice is to go through this textbook thoroughly even though you probably could pass the tests with a lot less effort. The more you take notes and learn the material, the easier the second and third SQL classes will be. This course took me another 6 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nC170 Data Management Applications - So basically if you did a good job actually learning the textbook in C175, this class is way easier. There's a new textbook and you can go through it to learn some more advanced ideas about optimizing tables for performance and non-redundancy. This class has a project and the project (like almost all of the WGU CS projects) doesn't actually take that long to do. I think I actually only spend 3 weeks on this class, but only because I thoroughly studied SQL in the prior course. It'll probably take longer if you only skimmed the first data textbook.\\n\\n  \\nD191 Advanced Data Management - People complain about this class because the training wheels disappear and there doesn't seem to be a lot of support. There's basically just a few documents explaining some advanced techniques like triggers and procedures (essentially they are function definitions in SQL with the ability to set auto update features to database tables). Then there's just a project. If you didn't really learn that much SQL in the first two classes and sort of half-assed it to this point, I imagine this class will be punishing because you don't know where to start. On the other hand, if you did a good job learning the material from the first two courses, this class is basically a weekend of coding. This class took me like 3 days. 1 day to read up about triggers and procedures, and the 2 days to code the project. It felt like it could have just been a part of the C170 class, but maybe they wanted to break it up a bit. By the way, none of these data projects are portfolio worthy. You're essentially just populating tables and then doing complicated queries linking tables together.\\n\\n  \\nC176 Business of IT Project Management - I think this class no longer exists. I took this class before the CS program updated and replaced this class with the linux course. I opted to switch to the new program knowing that this class no longer counts towards degree completion. Anyways, this is the Project+ certification class. I kind of liked it and entertained the idea of being a project manager. You learn how project managers keep track of ongoing projects through different visual tools and how scheduling works. I found it decently useful to know how real life team collaboration might look like. The test for this isn't that easy though, so if you hate reading this stuff, it'll be a chore. I'd say it's a medium difficulty class for a test based class, just because there's a lot of specific things to know. Took me 2 weeks and I used an online program that someone suggested on this subreddit for most of it (something like CB nuggets or something that sounds like that).\\n\\n  \\nC846 Business of IT Applications - Or is it this class that no longer exists? This is the ITIL 4 certification class. Boy oh boy this class is boring. You're just learning business terminology and it's eyerollingly dry. You just memorize a bunch of phrases like \"co-creating value with clientele\" and take a test to prove that you know how to sound like a soulless corporate suit having zoom meetings with stakeholders. I get that it's important to know how to speak to your managers, but by god this class was boring. I don't know maybe you'll like it and if you do, probably switch to an MBA or something. This class took me 2 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD194 IT Leadership Foundations - This is a one day class, no joke. You take a little personality test and then write a paper about your strengths and weaknesses as a leader. Boring, busy work. One thing that I noted was that the evaluators really care about how good your grammar and syntax is. They ultimately force Grammarly down your throat for this one, and honestly I had never used it before and I'll probably use it going forward. I thought I was already a decent writer. Turns out my syntax could be a lot better.\\n\\n  \\n**Term 3 (Uh oh):**\\n\\n  \\nC949 Data Structures and Algorithms I - I love this topic. This class introduces you to all of the building blocks that will allow you to learn leetcode and prepare for tech interviews. It doesn't get you all the way there, but it gives you all of the foundational knowledge. I bought a book called \"A Common Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms\" and read it fervently over the course of a week. It's a really cool topic. After reading that book, I skimmed over the textbook and did targeted practice problems. You could probably speed through this course since the test didn't feel that difficult, but honestly this is probably THE class to take seriously if you want to be a software engineer. I think I spent 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC960 Discrete Math II - Are you bad at math? If you are, this class might make you drop out entirely. HUGE difficulty spike here in terms of math abilities. I thought calc was a piece of cake and DM1 was a fun little experience. DM2 is the first class that made me go \"oh yeah, this is the difficulty of college classes that I remember from my first degree.\" So much information and a lot of it is just hard to do. Probability made me start doubting my own math skills and I've always felt confident with math. It WAS interesting though. Learning how to do RSA by hand was cool and insightful and so was learning Bayesian probability. I don't blame people for saying that it's the hardest course in the program. I definitely can see how it will weed a LOT of people out from earning this degree. I spent a little more than 2 months on it.\\n\\n  \\nC950 Data Structures and Algorithms II - My favorite class of the entire program. The project is a really cool one that you code from scratch using your own ideas. There's not a lot of new material that's required, but I went over the textbook anyways to learn about advanced data structures like red-black trees and specific algorithms like floyd-warshall and djikstra's. Basically the new material is REQUIRED to do the project, but the more tools you are aware of, the more creative you solution will be. If someone wanted to cheat themselves out of the experience, they can probably look at other student projects and base their solution off it. It turns out that the project constraints are a lot looser than you think (It's pretty easy to come up with a solution with lower mileage than they say), but I really enjoyed implementing my own solution. This project is portfolio worthy and the best part is that I would be prepared to talk at length about my problem solving strategy and how I built my solution, which is ultimately what projects are good for in interviews. The class took me 3 weeks to do. The first week was brainstorming, the second week was coding, and the third week was writing it up. It's a huge paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Term 4:**\\n\\n  \\nD197 Version Control - Kind of annoying if you've never used Git. I was taken aback at how complicated it felt doing all of this for the first time. Git is super important and while I understood the idea of version control, I couldn't help but think \"there's got to be a better way of doing this.\" There really isn't, it just gets easier. Took me 1 week as there's not actually much to it. I probably should have done this a bit closer to the Java classes since you have to use git for those projects. Instead, I had to relearn a lot of this when I got to those classes.\\n\\n  \\nC952 Computer Architecture - HAHAHA WOW this class is a beast. Imagine having to sit there and read a 400 page technical manual about how your CPU works. The material is DRY and sorry, there's no way around this class but to sit there and READ READ READ. If you try to shortcut out of this class, you'll fail that test miserably. Seriously, search this sub for this class and see how many people are begging for help and how many guides just say \"read the textbook.\" There's an instructor video series that can cut down your time a LITTLE bit, but it's more of a guide to tell you which sections to read more carefully and which sections to skim. Guess what? It's still a TON of reading. This class is the closest this program will get to traditional \"low level\" classes where you're learning assembly (ARM). I wish it talked more about how different logic gates worked, but whatever I'm gonna take the pass and move on. I don't think I want to be a hardware engineer based on this class. This took me 1 month of heavy studying (actual 15 hours per week).\\n\\nC191 Operating Systems - Basically the same experience as Computer Architecture. People will debate which class is harder and honestly it's close. Between the Computer Architecture class and this one, a lot of people will drop out of the program quietly because they're just such hard classes. Its hard both because there's so much material and also that the material is really hard to follow when you're reading it. So much detail and so much vocab on vocab on vocab. You need to know vocab just to get through each new section of reading. Reading these textbooks feel like reading another language at times. Just grind through it and know that once you finish these two courses, everything else will feel easier. Both these classes should have been split into two or more courses. This took me another month of heavy studying. The only good thing about these two courses is that since it's a straightforward \"read and take the test\" sort of class, it's easy to just schedule time every day to grind through the content. I find with some of the other classes with projects and papers, you might take longer just because you reach mental blocks where you need to find the motivation to do the next creative part. With these two classes it's just like \"I guess I'll read another 20 pages tonight.\"\\n\\n  \\nD281 Linux Foundations - WTF why didn't anyone warn me about this class. I thought it was going to be easy and then it turns out it's just a little easier than Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. You're basically reading the Linux manual, so it's really dry. There's not a lot of hands-on learning, so you're just trying to memorize a bunch of letters that represent shortcuts. For each linux command, you need to know what the optional arguments are and what they do. Seriously, its basically a flashcard class with a LOT of flashcards. There's a CISCO course that you can do, but essentially it's all the same. Memorize a bunch of letters and then take a linux certification test. This also took me a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nD286 Java Fundamentals - If you take this after the other coding classes, then it's a joke. It's just basic programming again, but with Java. I literally went \"are you serious?\" and scheduled the test after 3 days of looking at the material. It's just like any programming languages with slightly different syntax for stuff like printing. The test is interesting because you actually have to code solutions from scratch. The test is identical to the 14 problems at the end of the textbook, so just make sure you know how to do those problems. Don't memorize, just know how to code the answers. The test is almost word for word identical. Just a few numbers and instructions are switched. The class took me 3 days.\\n\\n  \\nD287 Java Frameworks - Okay if you actually have no real work experience and have never used a framework before, this class is a huge wake up call. I bought a book called \"Spring Start Here\" because people said it's better for beginners than the one in the course materials, and I agree. At least that book explains WHAT spring even IS and the basics of it. You only need to read half that book and then you can start your project. There are some decent guides on this sub for this class, but essentially you're learning how to write a springboot web app. The class feels very much like the training wheels are off and nobody is holding your hand, so this class can be very frustrating just trying to learn stuff yourself. The worse part is that you can't code the project from scratch. You have to use a lot of their starter code, so a lot of the project is just understanding what the existing code is doing and what you need to do to fix it and enhance it. I found this class more difficult than the DSA 2 project simply because at least with the DSA 2 project, the entire code file is mine and I knew how to build everything from scratch. This project feels like you're walking into spaghetti code and trying to make heads or tails of it without ever having seen this type of code. This took me 3 weeks.\\n\\n  \\nD288 Backend Programming - This project is even WORSE than the frameworks project because you're forced to code this project inside of a virtual lab environment. This is because you have to code your project to connect to a front-end angular project (written in typescript I believe) and a SQL database that is loaded into the lab environment. You can't modify the angular project and the database, so you just have to take the existing java code and connect up all the pieces. This is a frustratingly tedious project because you're essentially going through all three parts (front-end, spring app, and database) with a fine-toothed comb making sure that every single variable name and endpoint is meticulously typed correctly. Any mistake and boom, it doesn't work. Because you're working with so much existing code that is hard to decipher, this project feels very overwhelming. In the end, I guess it's sort of cool to know that your code is part of what looks to be a real life (albeit ugly) web app. I think people caution against using these java projects in your portfolio because so much of it isn't your actual code or even good clean code. This took me 2 weeks of coding while wanting to pull my hairs out. There's not that much new information, so you can just get to work when you open up this class.\\n\\n  \\nD387 Advanced Java - Why is this project ultimately easier than the other Java projects? The techniques themselves are more advanced for sure. You're basically messing around with multi-threaded code, but there's actually a lot less to do than the other projects. The project itself is weird. Why would anyone want their webapp to even have these functionalities. It's just sort of an excuse to get students introduced to using threads and seeing how race conditions work. This took me about a week to complete. You can just open up the project and get started.\\n\\n  \\n**Then I went Super Saiyan:**\\n\\n  \\nD284 Software Engineering - Piece of cake. You're just making stuff up and writing a project proposal. You can literally do it in a day. There's no new information to learn here really. You're just going through the motions of coming up with a solution for a client request. It's just a paper. Start the course and then start writing. You don't code anything, you just write the paperwork and answer things like \"How will you solve this problem?\" I did this in two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nD480 Software Design and Quality Assurance - Another piece of cake. A fake ticket comes in for a bug in an existing software. The bug seems like it's a really obvious fix, so you just write a paper about how you're gonna fix it. Another 1-2 day class. Just open up the class and start writing. I did this in another two days (5 hours total of nonstop writing).\\n\\n  \\nC951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence - I spent time on this class because I am particularly interested in AI and always have been, even before this ChatGPT stuff. A lot of this class actually isn't about the modern AI stuff that you're probably thinking about, like generative AI and neural networks. They do talk about that near the end of the textbook, but most of it is old school AI techniques (which are still very relevant). There's three projects total. The first project is a chatbot (not ChatGPT style, think more like old school hard coded bots) and that takes maybe a day or two after learning about AIML (the markup language, not like AI/ML). The second project is kind of annoying because you're working with what seems to be software from two decades ago. You have to follow a tutorial to build this 3d model of a robot and add sensors to it. There's some coding, but it's done in Lua, which is like python. You don't really need to learn the language thoroughly, just enough to script some behavior. Most of the time will be spent clicking around this glitchy software and then writing up the paper. You can do the second project in about 3-4 days. The third project is basically a big proposal sort of like the Software Engineering class. That's a very long paper, but at least you can just start writing it. It'll take you about 3-4 days to write. However, I spent about 2 weeks just reading the textbook because I liked the topic. You learn a lot about machine learning algorithms that are used in forecasting and all sorts of applications. The textbook gets REALLY technical very quickly, so I got lost eventually in the math and focused more on the concepts of what these algorithms are trying to do. It makes the capstone project a lot easier to navigate since you know what you're doing. In all, I took 3 weeks for this class even though if you only did the projects, it'll take you maybe 1 week and a half. You might pay for that during the capstone though.\\n\\n\\n\\n**I asked for a one month extension on my final term:**\\n\\nC964 Computer Science Capstone - This project is portfolio worthy in my opinion. It's what you make of it, but either way, you're asked to apply a machine learning solution to any sort of problem you want. You have to actually code it though unlike the AI writeups and present it somehow. I just learned how to use Jupyter and how to create widgets in the notebook. The first part of the project is basically a data analysis project, similar to what the data science people would do. You take a Kaggle dataset and analyze and clean the data. Then you use the cleaned data to train a machine learning model by splitting it up into a training set and testing set. Essentially machine learning algos are ways for the computer to figure out \"hidden patterns\" in data. So the training set helps the algo search for a technique on how to match inputs and outputs. Then you can use the test set to test how well it does for new data points. Then you have to take this model and present it such that a user could create a new data point on the fly and get a prediction. This project went into my portfoilio. I spent about 3 weeks total on this: one week brainstorming, one week coding, and one week writing.\\n\\n  \\nAnyways that's it.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         My Fun 41-Day MBA Journey - SO WORTH IT!!!!!!\\n \\n\\n\\*This is about my MBA journey, I hope to inspire, but don't be hard on yourself if your accelerated path is different\\*\\n\\nI was highly motivated and inspired by the post I read in this Reddit group from Sleyk2010, along with many other accelerators in this group and a few FB groups. Before I chose WGU for my MBA, I had my share of skepticism. I looked at numerous online and Brick and Mortar schools (I received my Bachelor’s from a traditional B&M University). I completed my BSBM in a little over two years for a 5-year program (about 18 months ago), so I was already used to acceleration. I could have accelerated my Bachelor’s degree even more, but of course, I could only go as fast as the university allowed. I had to go the full 6 or 8 weeks for a course, even if I completed all of my exams, papers, and reading ahead of time. This led to me doubling and tripling my course load each semester. What drew me to WGU was that I CAN DICTATE MY PATH. I knew that I had a hunger for reading books, writing papers, and retaining the coursework. I am just maniacal like that, so I don’t expect everybody to feel the way I do about school. I knew I could crush my goals through acceleration because I know myself well enough and have been able to do it in the past. School is actually fun for me and if that makes me weird or crazy, I will proudly own that, lol.\\n\\nAll of this being said, everyone approaches school at their own individual pace and I am not writing this to declare that everybody will complete their Master’s degree in a matter of weeks or a few months. Everyone’s motivation is also not the same and how a person approaches school impacts how they set their pace. There is no way to “cheat” a degree. Everyone gets the SAME courses and the same coursework. Less than 10% of students accelerate at a pace where they can achieve their degree in well under one term/semester. The norm is that students will take two terms or more. Be clear that it IS TOTALLY OKAY. There is no “correct amount of time” to finish a degree. It is totally up to you based on your motivation, the time you dedicate to it, and your ability to absorb the coursework.  No matter how quickly you finish, be proud that you finished and that it took some hard work to get there.\\n\\nSo, let me get to the fun part. The Reddit and Facebook groups are helpful and great motivators for those who decide to come to WGU. It is a great school, properly accredited, and VERY reputable. WGU is also very relevant for the working adult and career-minded individuals who want to advance their careers. I am laying out a full course-by-course write-up of how I approached each course and how I successfully passed it. Let me be clear, this is how I did it and what worked for me, so by no means will this be a blanket approach that works for everyone. It is a lot of hard work and some frustrating days will be ahead, but trust me, obtaining your MBA is doable if you stay focused and put in the work. I don’t have any “tricks,” no rubrics, no papers to use for sampling, and no study guides to pass along. For the sake of academic integrity, I won’t risk myself or anyone putting a stain on the school or me for giving people the easy way out. If I had to do the work, so do you. I am offering some guidance and motivation for students in the program. Hopefully, acceleration will work well for you all too!!!!\\n\\nAgain, I don’t have any work to pass along, so please don’t inquire. If anyone feels the need to minimize and discredit accelerators, keep that negative energy somewhere because accelerators are the exception, not the norm, so this is NOT easy. As you will see many accelerators say, they will not apologize for busting their ass to obtain their degree faster than others. Some people are brainiacs, some are overachievers, and some are both. That is not a bad thing. Also, some Program Mentors are better than others and will be supportive of your path. My mentor was AWESOME and I came in with a game plan and strategy that she backed me up on. I made it clear that I was accelerating and would NOT be in the program longer than 45 days because I am on a mission. I am maniacal in my approach and putting in 40 hours or more a week outside of work to do schoolwork is not a problem for me. I can rest when I finish my degree. I do not suggest this for everyone. Plus, I have an empty nest with all my adult children out on their own. I had some downtime at work and figured no time was better than the present to get my MBA and advance my career. I will start with the Three Commandments of WGU, which I will cite as a source courtesy of SLEYK2010 himself (which are great by the way!!)\\n\\n*“The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*, that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*. If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*, and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2 days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.”*\\n\\n***To add as an addendum to the commandments, use Grammarly or some type of paper editing application for your papers. They will eliminate grammar and spelling errors on all of your papers. It is your best friend. Also, use Quizlet, they have very useful study guides to use for the courses.***\\n\\n**\\*Disclaimer\\* This is not the order I TOOK the courses in, they are in numerical order. My game plan was to do all of the PA (writing courses) first and switch my brain over to the analytical courses next (ones with OAs). I did C213 and C214 Back-toBack because there was a lot of cross-over between the two courses. I  saved C215 and C207 for last because of the cross-over and because I wanted to close out with the OA and PA course (C207).**\\n\\n**On to the courses!!!**\\n\\n**ORA1** – **Orientation** – One PA\\n\\nDo what you feel is best for the orientation. If you have done a lot of research on the academic program before orientation opens up, this “course” won’t be tedious. Follow the rubric, keep it simple, and peruse the “coursework.” It simply gives an overview of what to expect as a student and ensures that you are prepared to start your program. Be as realistic as you can be when asked about how much of a time commitment you can truly make each week to your schoolwork.\\n\\n**C200** – **Managing Organizations and Leading People** \\- Two OAs (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nYou will start with what is called the “Signature Themes Assessment.” It does not take hella long to do and when you complete it, save the PDF. Task #1 is a paper centered around the assessment that you took. PLEASE FOLLOW THE RUBRIC when you write the paper. Task #2 focuses on leadership that you experienced in your career. It can be a past or present company. You won’t be able to use actual names for the company or the person (or people) that you write about. Have fun with it, the assignment will be about your life experiences, so it will be easy to speak to either way. I finished both papers in one day, I just got diarrhea of the brain and my hands did the rest. This is one course where I will say that even though there is some reading that is available, it won’t be of much use. The readings are pretty much common sense type of stuff and won’t make much of an impact on the papers that you have to write in this course. Just get straight to writing and have fun with it.\\n\\n**C202** – **Managing Human Capital** – One OA (Straightforward and Easy Course)\\n\\nThis class was pretty straightforward in my eyes. I assume we are all adults here and have been a part of a workplace environment that involved employee interaction. A lot of common sense and work experience type of content is in this course. The technical aspects of this course (terminology and concepts) are in the reading materials and there is a Quizlet (get acquainted with this site, it is VERY helpful) that is very helpful for the course. I did some of the reading, but a lot of it was stuff I covered extensively in undergrad, so I didn’t have to deep dive into the reading materials. This is the Human Resources course of the MBA program. I took the pre-assessment and reviewed my weak areas. I skimmed the readings and reviewed a few Quizlets to help me prepare for the OA. It took me about two days total to do the reading, study, and pass the OA. Again, the course is not a beast, you will know more about the course than you will think. Some people may take longer to get through the course and trust me, THAT IS OKAY.\\n\\n**C204** – **Management Communication** – Three PAs -Two Papers and One PPT&Video (Another Straightforward and Easy Course) \\n\\nThis course was actually a lot of fun. Tedious, but easy enough. There are some reading materials for this course, but honestly, they don’t provide much help for the actual tasks. I skimmed the materials to see what use I could make of them, but I was able to dive right into the tasks. Task #1 is a paper, but it will be constructed in a weird manner. The course is about professional communication in the workplace. You will be writing emails from the perspective of being a business owner or a supervisor. You will be writing emails to your staff, a business partner, and the stakeholders. The three emails will be fun to make, so don’t overthink the assignment.  Task #2 is a Powerpoint and Video. WGU uses Panopto for video creation. If you have never used it before (most of us probably have not), they provide instructional videos on how to use it. You should have access to Panopto as a student, but if you don’t, reach out to the IT department, and they will rectify that for you pretty quickly, usually within 24 hours. The video only needs to cover the points in the rubric and your PPT should be an outline of the presentation. Mine took over 15 minutes, but I am a classroom trainer by trade, so it was in my wheelhouse. Most people can truly do their presentation in less than 10 minutes. Follow the rubric to ensure you cover all the points they want you to cover and you will be fine. Task 3 is an executive summary. A one-page paper and you are good to go. All three tasks can be done by jumping in head first while the reading materials provide just a little help for the papers. I was able to complete all three tasks over two days.\\n\\n**C206** – **Ethical Leadership** – Three PAs (Straightforward but VERY tedious course)\\n\\nI did not personally find this class to be “hard,” but it is very labor-intensive. This course is similar to C200 in that you will be using another assessment called the “Ethical Lens Inventory” to start you off before your first task. There are 3 PAs and they are a doozy, lol. I honestly had fun with this class because I had a few ethics courses in undergrad and had to apply them in real life at work. The reading materials are enlightening and helpful but don’t be intimidated by any of the reading. A lot of the reading is stuff you have previously or currently face in your workplace and your life. I had a LOT of ammo to use for these papers, so the writing was pretty easy for me. Task #1 is to write about a leader you admire, a leader you know, or a famous leader. It does not matter; just make sure you cite any sources if you use someone you don’t know personally. Task #2 is focused on social responsibility, ethics in the workplace, and ethical leaders. You may find that your work experiences will be very useful for this paper. Life experiences can be the best teacher. Task 3 is a paper about leadership and the code of ethics. All three tasks will include life experiences and ethics concepts, so the reading materials are helpful. PLEASE make sure you follow the rubric to the letter for each task because it can be easy to miss a section and have your paper sent back for revision. I spent one day reading the materials a bit and two days doing the papers. Three days total. I wrote over 15 pages for each task, but trust me, many of you can do them in 10 pages, give or take a page. I do like to write, so I tend to write with extensive details, but if you like to keep things simple and just answer each section in a rubric, DO THAT. Writing a novel is not necessary, lol. I did get two excellence awards for 2 of the tasks I wrote for this course, so the long ass days of writing were worth it for me.   \\n\\n**C207** – **Data-Driven Decision Making** \\- Two PAs and One OA (Hard course for most, not very straightforward)\\n\\nIf any of you have read up on this class on Reddit or Facebook, you will see that this class beats people up. I can understand why it does. This is the Statistics class of the program. No real reading materials are provided for this course, which is why I say it is not so straightforward. There are TONS of PPTs and videos from the course instructors for this course. USE THEM. I personally love statistics and data, so I didn’t feel intimidated by the class. There is not a lot of math used in this course, it is heavy on concepts and statistical methods. Again, there are tons of resources in the course from the CIs, such as videos, study guides, and PPTs. Review them multiple times if you have to until you start to comprehend the material. Reach out to a CI if you need assistance, they are there to help. Quizlet is also helpful for the OA in this course because you will be using a lot of terminology. For task #1, you are forming a hypothesis that you will have to analyze for task #2. Once the evaluators approve task #1, you can move to task #2. The course will provide the framework for all the statistical methods you can use for your hypothesis. Most people chose a T-Test or ANOVA. I chose linear regression. I only chose it because it made more sense for my hypothesis. Use a topic you are familiar with for your hypothesis, it will make the task less painful. I used home values and mortgage rates because I work in the financial world, but I easily could have used sports for a topic too. For task #2, they provide videos and PPTs for each test that you perform and will show you how to input them in Excel. You will need at least 30 data points to use for the assignment but trust me, once you gather the info, it gets easier from there. Once you run the analysis in Excel, you will be writing a short paper (probably no more than 5 or 6 pages) that covers about 6 or 7 bullet points. As always, follow the rubric and keep it simple. For the OA, they provide a pretty good study guide and flashcards for the terminology, but Quizlet is an excellent supplement for this as well. The pre-assessment does not align heavily with the OA, but use it as a starting point for the areas that you do need to cover for the OA. My Program Mentor let me push this class to the end before the Capstone because I wanted to follow the Operations Management course (there is a lot of crossover between the courses). I honestly had fun with this class because I love Stats and Math (I am a math tutor on the side), so I didn’t lose my mind in the course. It took me about five days to read and watch the course materials, do the tasks, study, and pass the OA. Realistically, this course can easily take many weeks for people to complete and that is okay. It is not easy for most and you truly want to comprehend and retain what you learn in the course. \\n\\n**C211** – **Global Economics for Managers** – One PA (Somewhat hard course for most)\\n\\nMany people have stated this course kicked their butt and I can see why. There is a lot of technical stuff to cover in this course and if you are not a fan of economics or did not cover it much in undergrad, this class will be brutal. For me, I like this type of stuff and still use a lot of the micro and macro Econ knowledge I learned in undergrad, especially being in the financial industry. There are reading materials, study guides, videos, and PPTs available for this course and they are very helpful materials to use. Focus on the areas where you are the weakest because you don’t want to be in the dark in important areas that you don’t know. There are a lot of terms and concepts that you need to know and the study guides are very helpful in covering what you need to know. Use Quizlet too, it supplements the course material tremendously. There are helpful YouTube videos for Econ as well, so just know that there are many ways to skin a cat here to find helpful information. The pre-assessment somewhat aligns with the OA, so spot your weak areas and drill those down before the OA. I felt the class was not hard for me because of what I came into the class with, but I know that this class can be a lot of work for many. It is not a race; take as much time as you need to understand the course. It took me about three days to complete the course, but just try to get as much as you can out of the course and do it at your pace.   \\n\\n**C212** – **Marketing** – One HUGE PA (Straightforward and somewhat easy course)\\n\\nThis course was easy in terms of understanding the materials but the final paper is long as hell. You really have to APPLY what you learn in the course. I still remembered many marketing concepts from my Bachelor’s program, so I didn’t have to spend far too much time in the book. The concepts are easy to understand and there is no test, so just dig around a little bit in the reading materials for information that you need. There is no way to sugarcoat this, the paper is very long. It will likely be the longest individual paper you write in the program. With that being said, try to have fun with the paper. Many of the areas you have to cover on the rubric are based on your opinion of what you would do if you made marketing decisions for a business. Some of the technical stuff is in the readings, but a good portion of the paper is based on what you would do to market a business. My paper was about 20 pages, but I didn’t feel it was brutal. All in, I completed the course in 2 days. The writing was a lot, but not painful. \\n\\n**C213** \\- **Accounting for Decision Makers** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most, but reasonable)\\n\\nThis course is very technical and if you aren’t familiar with accounting, it may beat you up a little bit. However, if you have any accounting knowledge from your bachelor’s programs, this course will not feel so brutal. Being the nerdy dork that I am, I think accounting is fun. I still retained a lot of what I learned from undergrad and apply it in real life because I do my own accounting for my side business. I still got a lot out of the class and brushed up on concepts that I had learned before, so the class was not hard for me. With all of this being said, there are reading materials (especially the Hawaiian shirt guy who had a video at the end of each chapter) and a few other videos and study guides in the course. The materials are very helpful, trust me. YouTube even has a few basic accounting videos (just like YouTube has for Economics) that are useful. Whatever you do, just make sure you find materials that help you understand accounting concepts effectively. There is a lot of technical work to nail down for the OA and you will want to know and understand basic accounting concepts. There is hardly any math on the OA, and the minimal math used is not hard. Know your debits and credits, the accounting formula, and understand accrual accounting. Quizlet is also a useful tool to supplement the course materials. The course only took me two days to complete and pass the OA, but that is because I already knew the material and could grasp the new stuff. This is a course you may find will be useful in the future, so try to get something out of the class, no matter if it takes you weeks to get through it. Use the CIs if you are struggling because some of the concepts may initially feel foreign.\\n\\n**C214** – **Financial Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard for most)\\n\\nI won’t sugar coat it, this course is not as fun for me as the rest, lol. I don’t mind finance as a whole, it is just sooooo tedious. If you don’t have a finance calculator (I have had one for many years), make sure you get one. The preferable calculator to use is the TI-30 BAII. If you use any other kind of calculator, you are asking for your life to be filled with agony. Learn the basic functions of the calculator. The course provides a good video on how to use it as well as YouTube. However you do it, just make sure you know how to use the bloody thing. The great thing about this course is that the pre-assessment and the OA will provide all of the formulas that you need to use. You don’t have to remember the formulas, but you do need to know how to apply them and plug them into the calculator. This PA has much more math than the OA, so you will want to focus more on the concepts of Finance and how they apply to the real world. This course has some VERY helpful study guides, PPTs, and videos from the CIs. Quizlets are also very useful. Watch those darn videos 100 times if you have to until it sticks. You will not want to skate through this course, many people fail the OA, and many fail more than once. You can’t BS through this course, you will need to use the materials to grasp the concepts and enlist the help of a CI if you truly get stuck. The math part of the class was the easy part for me, I spent more time focusing on the application of finance principles and that was very fulfilling. I was able to learn things that I did not cover in my finance course in undergrad. I completed the course and passed the OA in a total of 4 days, but I came in with a pretty good foundation that really helped me retain the stuff I learned in the course. Remember, GO AT YOUR PACE. Once you feel confident about the materials, take that OA and put it behind you. \\n\\n**C215** – **Operations Management** – One OA (Medium to Hard Course)\\n\\nLet me start off by saying that I like this course the least, lol. The main reason is that I was not as passionate about the material. With that being said, I got the most out of this course. I learned a hell of a lot. There is quite a bit of cross-over with C207 because the manufacturing industry utilizes a lot of statistical methods (like Six Sigma, Lean, etc.).  I studied my ass off in this class and completing it was the most fulfilling. The reading materials are helpful, but they are dense and probably more dry than most of the reading. The study guides in the course from the CIs, Quizlet, and some of the reading from the book got me through the class. It is honestly that simple. The materials are there, they are straightforward, they apply to the OA, and they are tools to help you succeed in the course. It took about five days to learn the materials, study, and pass the OA. This course tends to stop people in their tracks and they drag through this class for over a month or more. Don’t be scared of the course. Dive in, learn the material, and don’t stop and start the course to drag it out. That is how you lose your momentum and the course ends up feeling sluggish. Operations Management will be very good material to retain and for people in factories or other manufacturing fields, you will be very comfortable with the coursework. I will also add that this course is one of the most important courses to use as a foundation for the Capstone.\\n\\n**C216** – **MBA Capstone** – Three PAs - PPT & Video, One Huge Paper, and 3-part final task (Very Tedious Course but soooooo much fun)\\n\\nWoohoo!!!!! You made it to the end!!!! You will now apply all the valuable teachings from your other courses and roll them all into the Capstone. The Capstone is centered around a Marketplace Business Simulation. You will be the owner and decision-maker of a business and have six total quarters to make sound business decisions and get a simulation score of at least 0.001 or higher. If you fail, you have the take the simulation all over again. Trust me, you do not want to be set back because of that. Before you do the simulation, it wouldn’t hurt to read the Conscious Capitalism articles they provide. There is no book for the course, just the articles. The CIs provide videos on how to do each task and they may be helpful for each of you to use when figuring out how to structure your presentation and paper. Now, on to the Simulation. You are going to do the simulation for three quarters and pause. You will assess your business and review your decisions so far (you cannot go back and change them once you submit the quarter). Do all of Quarter 4, but do NOT submit it (or else you will make your life hell and screw up the simulation for yourself). Once you complete (but not submit) Quarter 4, it is time to do the PPT and video presentation for task #1. You are a business owner and should act as such, so wear some business casual clothes for your Panopto presentation. You are giving an update of the business through Q4 and telling stakeholders your business plan while asking for more money to invest for the next few quarters. Don’t stress over the PPT, the course provides a template for the presentation PPT and you just have to fill in the relevant information from your business. Most people can do their presentation in 15 minutes, give or take a few minutes. Mine was 40 minutes, but that is because I live for classroom teaching and presentations. It is fun and I definitely overdid it. Once you complete Task #1 and submit it, NOW you can go in and submit Quarter 4. You have to submit task #1 before you do that so the evaluators can go in and open the final two quarters. Now you will work on completing Quarters 5 and 6. My best advice is to be a conscious business. Your decisions should be centered around that because that is what this is all about, right? You can get a jump on task #3 while you wait for task #1 to be reviewed. Task #3 is a reflection paper on what you have learned in the MBA program, make a S.M.A.R.T. goal, how it will be used for your future career path, and include “career and education artifacts.” You will also submit your LinkedIn profile. The rubric will break it all down for you. You can easily complete task #3 in a few hours with the paper and the gathering of your artifacts. Beware though, you CAN NOT submit task #3 until you have completed AND submitted task #2. Just keep it on ice until you submit task #2 and submit task #3 a minute later.  Once you complete all six quarters, you will review your business results in Quarter 7. From this point, you will gather everything you need for the final paper in task #2. Task #2 will be long (mine was 20 pages), but there will be screenshots of graphs and other charts included, so it will not be 100% written words, lol. Follow the trusty rubric and just rock out that last huge paper. You ran the business and made all the decisions, so you will have all of the intimate details of the simulation and will be the best person to speak on it, so own it and tell your story! Whew! Submit task #2, then submit task #3 and wait for the last evaluations of the MBA program.   The Capstone took me about nine days.\\n\\nThe MBA program took me 41 days, but I feel if I didn’t have to go out of town a few times, give myself a couple of days of rest, and not lose a day to revise a task (Task #3 of the Capstone, my silly self did not upload one of my artifacts), I would have completed it in less than 30. I will still take it though and I am very proud that I still crushed my goal.\\n\\nOnce everything is graded and you get confirmation that your final task passed, you can now scream to the world….. YOU ARE AN MBA GRAD!!!!!! \\n\\nSoak in the moment, celebrate your achievement, thank your mentor(who will submit you for graduation), thank your family and friends who have been in your corner, and pat yourself on the back for what you accomplished. Then, wait about 7-10 days for the WGU Owl and Confetti to appear on your WGU profile page, which will officially confirm you are a grad and can no longer access your courses. The road is not easy and some may take longer to get to the finish line than others, but once you finish, you are a winner. No one will be able to take it away from you!!!\\n\\nGO OWLS!!! Remember, you can do it with effort and motivation too :-)\\n\\nON TO THE MSML WHEN MY NEXT TERM BEGINS!!!!!!!  \n",

                                                                                         Success Story - 60k IT job 1 week after graduation!!! 1.5 terms nothing to FT Job Offer. Full accelerated-BSIT Write Up\\n**Intro**  \\nHi Night Owls! I'm a long-time lurker on this subreddit and I've been here since the summer of 2023. I'm a 22y/o based out of the east coast (US). WGU changed my life. In this post I'm going to share my story and the result of 18 months of hard work! I'm also going to provide you guys with the best tips and pieces of information I've gathered from countless hours of researching the job market, reading r/resumes and other related subreddits, news articles, interviews, etc. I'm making this post as a way of reflecting on the past 2 years of my life and to give back to the community by sharing information & my story. My DMs are open for anybody who has questions or would just like to chat!\\n\\n**Background**  \\nI was working as a security guard before WGU and I had a lot of free-time at work to spend on my laptop. I knew I wanted a degree but couldn't afford the tuition and didn't like the idea of graduating much later than my friends I went to HS with. WGU offered me a solution to both of these problems, and I was able to complete a LOT of school work during work hours (I had explicit permission from my manager). This was an amazing opportunity for me because I still lived at home with my parents and was being paid between $17-20/hr to complete school work. If this sounds like something that interests you, I encourage you to apply to Securitas, Allied Universal, GardaWorld, or Prosegur. Look for \"warm body\" sites- locations where you're paid to just sit at a desk in an empty building. Overnight and weekend jobs are great for this sort of thing as well. A good resource for getting into the security industry is r/securityguards. You won't need to carry a firearm if that's a concern of yours. Also, be advised, some states require you to have a security guard license. Personally I didn't have to.\\n\\nI knew I wanted to study IT so choosing which degree program to enroll in wasn't difficult for me. I chose to do the accelerated BSIT->MSITM program and had a clear idea in mind of the career path I wanted to take. I cannot overstate the importance of doing research on career trajectories from different degrees. The [WGU website](https://www.wgu.edu/) does a decent job of providing degree and career information from whichever degree you choose, but the WGU website alone is simply not enough. Interview/talk with people in the field you're interested in, possibly shadow them, start projects of your own- it is entirely your responsibility to create a plan going into this. Changing your degree program later down the road is completely acceptable but do understand the consequences associated with that (time, money, etc). On a separate note, it's a good idea to organize your school materials and whatnot prior to starting. I created a free [Notion](http://www.notion.com) to keep track of my schedule, save informative Reddit posts and other course materials, track my progress, create reminders, store documents, etc. Another benefit of learning Notion and using it was that I was able to put this tool on my resume.\\n\\n**Pre-WGU**  \\nI took as many courses on [Sophia](https://www.sophia.org/) that I possibly could, prior to officially enrolling. I'm not entirely sure if things are the same with Sophia nowadays but when I did it, all of the courses/tests were unproctored and open-book. I highly, HIGHLY recommend that you do Sophia courses. I didn't do [SDC](https://study.com/) and personally I don't recommend it because their courses can take a while. [This resource](https://partners.wgu.edu/general-transfer-guidelines) outlines what you can transfer in, for each WGU degree. I also transferred in the CompTIA A+, N+, S+ (these three certifications together are commonly referred to as the trifecta), because I already had them. WGU will pay for attempts for certifications if they are *required* for your degree program. I used to have a good transfer guide saved but I'm not sure what happened to it; [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1390mx6/bsit_im_still_waiting_on_my_transfer_eval_of_my/) might be a helpful resource as well. Also, before you officially enroll, make sure to buy a webcam for the OAs. I use the Webcam 1000 which is what WGU recommends. It plugs into my laptop and works great. I've heard of other people buying one that has a tripod, so do some research and get whichever is best for you. Despite the scary proctoring stories you might read on this subreddit, I've never had any bad experiences myself. YMMV\\n\\nYou get assigned a Program Mentor before your start date. Mine has been extremely helpful and respectful of my preferred communication style and needs. I have seen reddit posts where people complain about their mentors- them wanting to schedule too many meetings, not opening classes, etc. This might be a good [resource](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/16ybsoq/can_i_request_to_change_my_mentor_what_is_your/).\\n\\n**WGU**  \\nMy start date was October 1, 2023. I was able to complete 13 courses in my first term (a term is a 6 month period). I definitely recommend looking up the course code in this subreddit (ex: C268) to find resources. Here is some helpful information about the courses that stand out to me:\\n\\nC268 - This was the 4th class I had, and the real first challenge for me. I think it's like a meme in the WGU-IT community that we've all used [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/pf6syi/c268_spreadsheets_video/) to help us pass. <15hrs of studying.\\n\\nC962 - This class was the most amount of writing I've had to do in my undergrad. You'll enjoy this class if you like reading, researching, and finding a great quote to support your writing. I think I wrote my paper about AI or wearable technology or something. This class was <25 hrs of work.\\n\\nC773 - I enjoyed this class a lot. This is an [exceptional resource.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1f12w4e/summary_user_interface_design_c773_passed_in_6/)\\n\\nD333 - I passed this exemplary on my first attempt but a lot of people have trouble with this class. I think that most of the names of the laws you have to memorize are self-explanatory. [This ](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1d2f20e/d333_finished_in_3_days_passed_first_try_heres_how/)reddit post helped me formulate a strategy for studying for the exam, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/zhy5l8/d333_ethics_in_technology_updated_class_version/) post provides a lot of good learning material.\\n\\nThe CompTIA trifecta can be studied through [free courses](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/tcqdwh/guys_please_remember_that_wgu_gives_you_a_lot_of/) through udemy (all WGU students get a free udemy account). FWIW, I quit my security guard job around this time because I was offered an unpaid internship at my friend's dad's company. I'll talk more about this later.\\n\\nMy second term was from April 1 - Sept 30, and I was able to complete 3 courses (10 CUs):\\n\\nC954 - I spent a week straight in the library studying for this. Imo, this class is on par with the CompTIA A+ in terms of just how much course material there is. [This](https://onlinedegreeblog.com/wgu-c954-information-technology-management/) is a FANTASTIC read for those interested. Personally I loved this class because I felt like it tied everything together and gave me PRACTICAL insight into how companies (and specifically their IT department) function. If you're interested in additional learning opportunities beyond WGU, definitely look into Hubspot. It's a very popular CRM (well, it's more than just a CRM) that a lot of employers care about.\\n\\nC783 - I actually have weird circumstances regarding this class. I *forgot* to submit my CAPM certification prior to my start date. I reached out to my mentor and Student Support Services for help. My Mentor was able to fill out a form or something... and well, WGU made an exception for me. WGU makes it clear that they don't accept transfer credit after matriculation but they did for me, just this once. As a result, my program changed a little bit. I believe the BSIT is normally 122 credits but mine was changed to 138. Because I had passed the CAPM, the additional credits came from other courses, outside of my BSIT program, that were marked as Passed simply because me having the CAPM qualified me as having passed those courses. I never took the WGU OA for this class.\\n\\nI definitely slowed down in my 2nd/3rd terms and honestly I slacked off a lot. I was able to pull myself together and finish despite a lack of motivation. My third term was scheduled to end on the end of March (this month).\\n\\nC769 - My capstone project took me 2 weeks. Mine was about improving the security posture of a fictitious company. I really enjoyed working on this. If you're reading this and are about to start/currently working on your capstone, congrats on making it this far! I had a fun time using resources from my previous classes to work on this. I took this class more seriously than some of the others because I wanted my work to be a reflection of everything I've learnt at WGU.\\n\\nC777 - The dreaded Web Dev Applications. I took the Sophia course that is supposed to provide a foundation for this course so I didn't start with much knowledge. I procrastinated for weeks lol. PLEASE read the Study Guide. [This](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/coursearticle?Id=kA03x000000l9D8CAI) is a link to the study guide but I'm not sure if that link works, so please also refer to the 21day challenge document, sent in an email by your course instructor. I also watched the TraversyMedia HTML+CSS video a couple times and followed along with him. He will have you download SublimeTxt which is good, but I chose to use Visual Studio Code. The C777 study guide is your best friend. You're ready for the OA if you can score 90%+ on the practice OA, and if you feel comfortable creating a website. Another thing: some people may disagree with this, but for the purpose of passing your OA, try to not teach yourself additional information that isn't covered in the class. It can be a lot of information, try not to overwhelm yourself.\\n\\nD247 - I hated this class. This was my absolute worst class, and I just hated every second of it. My course instructor was amazing and I absolutely recommend that you review the powerpoints they've created- it's what helped me pass! The powerpoints will most likely be emailed to you. If not, please ask for them. One small mistake will flag your entire answer wrong for OA questions where you have to write code.\\n\\n**Graduation and my Personal Success Story**  \\nI applied for graduation on March 3rd and officially graduated on the 11th. I was emailed a link to download my WGU transcripts the next day, and was emailed a digital copy of my Diploma today (the 18th). I'm still waiting for my physical diploma and [regalia](https://www.buildagrad.com/wgu) to arrive. I'll be attending the Vegas commencement in April, hope to see you all there!!!! Maybe we can get a big groupchat together for people going! :)\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, I was offered an internship at my friend's dad's IT company. It was very informal and honestly a little disappointing but I was grateful for the opportunity to observe their work and go with them to meet with clients. I stayed with them for about 3 months or so and then decided to take a break to focus on my last two classes. Part of me regretted leaving my security job but I also didn't want to continue working there either. In the end, it worked out for me because I was able to put that \"internship\" on my resume and I figured that it looks better than no internship.\\n\\nI started to apply for jobs the moment I submitted my graduation application, which is what I recommend to everyone (if not sooner). However, it wasn't until after I graduated when I found the job posting for the job I got an offer for. I graduated on 3/11- on 3/12 I applied to this IT support technician job. I reached out to the recruiter (guide on that below) and we instantly connected. She helped me secure a screener interview (through Zoom) with the company later that week. I passed the screener interview and we set up an in-person interview yesterday. Honestly, I bombed the technical questions. I got destroyed in front of the CEO. I think I got the position because I spoke confidently and was transparent about my knowledge gaps. I arrived in a freshly dry-cleaned suit with 3 copies of my resume, and I took notes during the interview on my black leather padfolio (please buy one of these!). Every time they asked me a technical question I didn't know the answer to, I wrote it down, and said I'd research the answer. Also- before my interview- I wrote down questions I had for them, in my padfolio.\\n\\nThe job I was offered is a hybrid position and I couldn't be happier!!!! In 1.5 years I went from a security guard making 17/hr to making TC\\~60k in an MCOL, and I still live w my parents so no rent. Never, absolutely *never* doubt yourself.\\n\\nBelow are some tips I have for Resumes, Cover Letters, Applying, and Interviews. :)\\n\\n**Resume and Cover Letter Tips**  \\nYou already know that your resume (and cover letter) is extremely important, so I'm going to talk about how you can improve. Resume formats and the amount of creativity you can have really depends on the industry, so please don't interpret this as an end-all-be-all guide. This is more so for tech. Bluntly, you should have a pretty straightforward and easy-to-read resume.\\n\\n* Your resume should be 1 page unless you have 10-15+ years of experience. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1jeg5ks/4_yoe_unemployed_tech_field_united_states/) is similar to what I use for mine (Idk why it's so zoomed in). Also please don't use a two-column layout.\\n* Your resume should be in an ATS-readable font such as Arial or Times New Roman (I use TNR for mine) and size 11 or 12.\\n* I suggest that you keep your resume in black and white. Don't use icons, shapes, or emojis. Far too often I see resumes with a little phone icon or something next to their phone number. These icons/shapes/emojis can look nice but they can also mess with the ATS (applicant tracking system) scanners, and also take the readers attention away from important details as they can be very eye-catching.\\n* Aim to fill the entire page. If you don't have enough experience or whatever that's completely fine, but there are ways to mitigate that. For instance you should use 12px size font, maybe expand upon your PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY section, make the size of your headings a little bigger, etc. You could also put a Relevant Coursework section in your Resume and name your WGU classes (don't include the course code \"C268\", just the name). This is what I did. During an interview, the hiring manager asked me about one of my classes!\\n* Your name/contact info section should contain your Firstname Lastname, phone number (xxx) xxx-xxxx, email (make sure your email sounds professional. Your professional email shouldn't be \"[gamerboy1206@gmail.com](mailto:gamerboy1206@gmail.com)\", it should be your name), a link to your Linkedin profile, and then city, State. Never put your exact address on your resume. That's a security concern and they don't need your address anyways, or at least until you get a job offer.\\n* Please, Please trim your Linkedin handle. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNDY2KnXBw) for a guide on how to do that. Ensure your trimmed Linkedin handle is then put at the top of your resume\\n* If you have experience that isn't relevant to what you're applying for, put it on your resume anyways! Especially if you were there for a long time or if you really gained skills/experience.\\n* The bullet points under your jobs should NOT be pure fluff words. Instead, write meaningful statistics and hard facts.\\n   * \"Increased operational efficiency\" means nothing. Instead, you can put \"Achieved X through Y which resulted in Z\"\\n   * One of the bullet points in my resume is \"Efficiently handled over 100+ monthly calls, including inquiries, service calls, incident reports, technical support, and emergency responses.\" This bullet point includes an actual statistic, \"100+\", in a timeframe \"monthly\", and I specified the different types of regular issues I dealt with. Truthfully, I could have been more specific on \"technical support\", but I got the message across that I handled a variety of different inquiries. My intention there was to showcase my diverse skillset- again, there is always room to improve!\\n* WGU actually offers classes on Resume building, and will review your resume for free. You can find information to that [here](https://careers.wgu.edu/channels/resumes/). I did this, and the results were amazing! The more people you can get to look over your resume, the better.\\n* !! This one is very important. The end result of your resume should be a PDF. I've always used Google Docs online to create my resume. It allows me to convert it into a PDF with two clicks of my mouse. When you download your PDF, PLEASE rename it to \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_Resume\", instead of just \"Resume\". This will make it 1000x easier for hiring managers to see your resume and know it's from you. A lot of people name their resume just \"Resume\"... you need to stand out, and that's how you do it!\\n\\nIn addition to a resume, you should also make a cover letter template. Meaning, for every new cover letter you create, you change the name of the job title and company (written in the CL) to match the job you're applying for.\\n\\n* If you choose to make two templates, here is what I recommend you do: the first template should be called \"FirstName\\_Lastname\\_CoverLetter\\_CompanyName\" and also \"FirstName.Lastname.CoverLetter.CompanyName\". That way, there is a slight difference between the two (that only you know of) and it still looks professional. For instance, lets say you want to apply to Helpdesk roles and Project Coordinator roles. The Helpdesk cover letter template could be the one with the periods, whereas the Project Coordinator cover letter templates could be the one with the underscores. Again, this is a very subtle way for you to distinguish between the two, so you can have a more personalized cover letter for the jobs you're applying to. This is actually what I do personally.\\n   * For example, my Project Coordinator cover letter is more geared towards PM/Project coordinator positions. It mentions my CAPM cert\\n* Your Cover letter should contain the same name and contact info as your resume. Same email, phone number, city, etc.\\n* Your CL (ideally) should be the same font and font size as your resume. I don't think this is necessarily required but the attention-to-detail can go a long way. I like the uniformity of doing it this way.\\n* As a general rule of thumb: the first paragraph (3-4 sentences) should explain who you are, the body paragraph should talk about your experiences, qualifications, why you want the position, and why you're a good fit, and the closing paragraph (2-3 sentences) should reaffirm your interest, express gratitude, and indicate your eagerness to discuss this opportunity/interview.\\n\\n**My 'Guide-to-Apply'**  \\nIt's vey rare that I'll hear back from an application submitted thru Indeed. LinkedIn is my preferred way to apply. I have LinkedIn premium (I highly suggest you try the $0 down *free trial*). I swear, it's what helped me get this job. If you get contacted about scheduling an interview, your next steps should be to research the company ([Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) is an amazingggg tool for this).\\n\\n* Look up for tech job openings near you. Most of IT (and some CS) start out in job titles such as Helpdesk, Support I, jr IT specialist, IT technician, stuff of that nature. That's what you should be looking for. Don't expect to go right into cybersecurity lol. The reality is that cybersecurity is mid-level and senior-level.\\n* Have realistic salary expectations. A huge factor is where you live (understand the terms LCOL, MCOL, HCOL). But I think that a very general rule of thumb is that out of college you can reasonably expect between 40-65k for an entry level IT job, with the national avg being about 51k ish.\\n* GET A PROFESSIONAL PORTRAIT TAKEN FOR YOUR LINKEDIN. Have your hair nice, shave your face or freshen up your facial hair, wear a fresh outfit, have a SOLID WHITE BACKGROUND, and just be presentable. You should want to look your best. [This is interesting:](https://www.earth.com/news/attractive-people-have-more-career-opportunities-and-success/)\\n   * DON'T put your headshot (or any pictures) on your resume. This might be a norm in other cultures but definitely not for tech jobs in the US\\n* Go on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and get a nice background for your linkedin. Doesn't have to have any text, could even just be a solid color with a gentle gradiant. Anything is (usually) better than the default background. Mine is just a blue background with some lines on it, it looks like waves. It's just an artistic thing. But I made sure that the tie I'm wearing in my profile picture is the same shade of blue as my background. I think it ties it together nicely.\\n* Reach out to a recruiter. I wouldn't have gotten this job opportunity without my recruiter's help. In my opinion, a good recruiter might feel like a 'temporary career coach'. My recruiter gave me advice, gave me constant updates, insight, etc. She was amazing. This is the message I sent her to initiate our first conversation:\\n   * Hi,  I hope you're doing well! I came across the *JobName* position at *CompanyName* and am very interested. I’d love to learn more about the key qualities and skills you’re looking for in applicants. Would you be open to a quick chat? I’d be happy to send my resume if that would be helpful.  Looking forward to your reply!  Best, *FullName*\\n* Monitor your email regularly. People don't like to be kept waiting, especially when companies may be interviewing potentially hundreds of other applicants.\\n\\n**Interviews**  \\nOne of the best resources for interviews (and resumes too) I've ever come across is chief.analyst on tiktok.  Even though he's in an entirely different industry (finance), I love his advice and how articulate he is. Being able to speak confidently and clearly is a non-negotiable. Never underestimate the importance of good communication- it's what helped me get this job after not being able to answer a single technical question correctly despite being up against over 160 other applicants.\\n\\nIt's typical for you to go through a virtual interview before being invited to an in-person interview. This is called a screener and as the name suggests, it's for screening out candidates who don't meet the qualifications necessary or those who appear to be unenthusiastic. Showing enthusiasm and positive energy is incredibly important- you can show this by asking questions, smiling, and knowing what the company does.\\n\\n* I mentioned this earlier in my Graduation section but invest in a padfolio. I think I got mine for $12 from Target. It should carry 3 copies of your resume (anything more is excessive) business cards if you have them (I personally did not), a pen (ensure that it works and isn't out of ink!), and paper for notes. You don't need your padfolio for a virtual interview- instead, I'd recommend you have your full attention on the interviewer. It helps to look directly at the camera (instead of your screen) so it gives the illusion you're looking directly at the interviewer, from their end.\\n* In my padfolio, I also wrote down questions I wanted to ask the interviewers, the night prior to the interview. Having pre-written questions made me look more prepared and took the burden off of me of having to remember them.\\n* Push in your chair after getting up, like when leaving your interview. Similarly- if they offer you water at the start of your interview, make sure you throw out the cup in a trashcan and don't leave litter in their office.\\n* Maintain eye contact and speak slowly. For me, it helps when I use my hands when I talk.\\n* Look, dress, and smell nice. You don't have to be a model but definitely make yourself look the best you possibly can. Also, it's better to be overdressed than underdressed.\\n* I like watching CareerVidz on Youtube because he comes across as a little silly and that may (hopefully) take some pressure off of you. It's okay to be nervous, but try not to make it apparent.\\n* Rehearse your [elevator pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy6S0iTZx54).\\n* Research the company you're applying for, before any interviews. You can show a genuine interest in the company by understanding what they do and who they are.\\n* References: If you don't have any professional references, you can definitely ask a course instructor or your Program Mentor! They are here to support you and they will absolutely vouch for you (speaking from experience).\\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI think it's incredibly important to continuously grow and improve regardless of which stage you're at- whether you're considering enrolling, have already enrolled, are about to graduate, or even if you're looking for a job. I'm hopeful that my write-up is able to offer a fresh perspective on the challenges and possibilities you might encounter. Sorry for any typos/weirdly worded sentences lol.\\n\\nI'm now looking forward to starting my MSITM on April 1 and starting my new job. If you have any tips/advice for the MSITM program, I'd love to get some info\\n\\nHope to see y'all at the Vegas commencement ceremony!!\\n\\nEDITS: Expanded upon my internship, additional random bullet points all throughout  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               D288 - Back-End Programming 2024 Guide!\\nHello fellow night owls!\\n\\nHope you're having a fantastic semester. I finished this course about two months ago, and since I have time, I want to write up an updated guide for D288 that consolidates all older resources, and includes new tips/explanations. This guide is mostly an extension of this guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288\\_backend\\_programming\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/d288_backend_programming_guide/), but I wanted to fill in the gaps that it misses. Without further ado, let's get into it!\\n\\n# What are the prerequisites for this the class?\\n\\nI've seen some people attempt this class before taking D287 - Java Frameworks. **I do not recommend this.** This course explains Spring Boot much less and involves tougher problems. There are also tasks in this course that are similar to D287, which are explained better in D287. This guide assumes you have taken D287 first, and I will not be running through how to set up IntelliJ, reviewing DAO project structure, discussing maven dependencies, etc. If you want some help with these topics and with taking D287, you should definitely check out this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287\\_java\\_frameworks\\_ultimate\\_project\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/15mocjz/d287_java_frameworks_ultimate_project_guide/)\\n\\nBasic knowledge of SQL is also highly recommended. I'd at least recommend having D426 - Data Management - Foundations down. And while this project uses an Angular front end, no knowledge of Angular or Typescript is required. You'll need to read a few files, but you're just looking for variable names. You will not modify the front end at all.\\n\\nWhile I am saying all of this, do whatever you want! I think having these prerequisites will greatly improve your speed and efficiency in the course, but if you think you can handle it, go for it! The provided Udemy course and instructor videos do a decent job of detailing what you need to know for the project.\\n\\n# Project summary\\n\\nYou are given an angular front-end and a MySQL database for an e-commerce website. You are tasked with creating a back-end that links the front-end and the database. You must also create services so that the website can create tracking numbers, update the database, etc.\\n\\n# How should I approach the project?\\n\\nI tend to divide this project up into 3 sections:\\n\\n1. Setting up your coding environment.\\n2. Linking the back-end and front-end.\\n3. Creating the back-end services.\\n\\nThe course provides a ZyBooks and links to a Udemy course in Module 1. I didn't touch the Zybooks with a 10-foot pole. On the other hand, **the Udemy course is a central inspiration of the performance assessment.** The strategy I used was to watch the course alongside coding the assessment because often times you just mirror what's happening in the video. This is something I learned from the guide cited above.\\n\\nAlso, there are a lot of points in the project where you won't really be able to test your code. Don't worry about this. If you've completed the requirements in the rubric, commit and move on. It's expected to go back later and fix bugs created during the earlier stages of the assessment (per my CI).\\n\\nAlright, enough disclaimers. Let's get into the project itself!\\n\\n# Section 1\\n\\n**This section covers tasks A and B of the performance assessment.**\\n\\nBefore you even begin, you have a decision to make. *Do you want to work on the project in the provided lab environment, or would you rather work on it on your own machine?* I did the entire project on my own computer, which personally was a much better experience. Although, it is more difficult to set up the project. Here are the pros and cons for running the project on your own machine:\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Use more than 1 monitor\\n* Increased performance (relative to your equipment)\\n* No time limit (Lab environment resets after 40 hrs of usage. Saving the lab and coming back to it starts your timer where it left off.)\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Need to install everything yourself\\n* Potential compatibility issues\\n\\nFor those who want to utilize the lab environment, there is a link to it in the performance assessment (at the bottom of the page) and there is a whole instructor video showing how to configure it. For those who want to use their own PC, do the following:\\n\\n1. Follow the instructor-provided \"D288 Setting up the project\" video from 3:15 to 15:01. This will set up the GitLab repo, the IntelliJ project, and link them together.\\n2. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/1dt4dbj/final_project_setup_guide_for_no_lab_environment/) to install all dependencies. I left a comment on this post that clarifies some things, so check that out if you're interested!\\n\\nAfter setting up your environment, **MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT WITH A MESSAGE THAT SAYS YOU COMPLETED TASK B!**\\n\\n# Section 2\\n\\nAlright, time for some coding!\\n\\n**This section covers tasks C, D, and E of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task C:** This task is super easy. Just drill down to `src/main/java/com.your.groupname`, right click > new > Package. This will create a new package. Do that 4 times, and name your packages accordingly.  If you want a video to reference, watch video 49 in the Udemy course. Also, if you haven't already, construct a fifth package named \"config\" and copy the `RestDataConfig.java` file into it, which you can find in the lab files directory. Replace the `application.properties` file with the one in the lab files directory. If you don't know where the LabFiles folder is, it's at C:\\LabFiles on the lab environment. `RestDataConfig.java` will have an error in it right now, but don't worry about it. We will fix that later.\\n\\nI also wanted to point out something that the older D288 guide had in it:\\n\\n>Go to 1.1 in Zybooks, and watch the JavaBits video. About halfway thru you can see the layout.\\n\\nThis tip can help out a lot if you want to confirm your project structure is good. You can always go back and reference it in future steps as well. It also contains a code snippet we'll need to copy later.\\n\\nOnce your 5 packages are created and you have the `RestDataConfig.java` and `application.properties` files imported from the lab files, commit and push task C.\\n\\n**Task D:** Here's the first hard part. You'll need a lot of attention to detail to get this right. We need to create all of the entities and define the relationships between each entity. This is where SQL knowledge will come in handy since you'll be needing to read a UML diagram. There are two supporting documents on the performance assessment page you'll need to download and reference. The one I prefer is the \"ERD Diagram\" because the relationships are more clear, however, **both diagrams are slightly incorrect**. One thing mapped incorrectly will cause your program to fail. To get the best results, cross reference the two provided diagrams, **and pay very close attention to** **what's in the provided front-end and database.** (For more info on this, continue reading.) If you need a quick refresher on crow's foot notation, I'd check out this article: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/crows-foot-notation-relationship-symbols-and-how-to-read-diagrams/)\\n\\nIn the Udemy course, follow along section 9 videos 49 and 50. These will show you how to create an entity. Most of the entity creation is exactly the same, but there are a few key differences:\\n\\n* Use `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. These methods are less prone to break. (This applies to the rest of the assessment as well.) **In order for this to work, you must have a very specific version of Lombok and Spring Boot. View \"Important Notes\" below for an update.**\\n* When filling out the names of your columns in `@Column(name = ___)`, and when choosing the data type, **mirror the column properties in the SQL database.** The easiest way for me to do so was by reading the SQL script you use to initialize the database. Read each `CREATE TABLE` statement and copy each name and data type exactly.\\n* When filling out the **variable names** in your entities (NOT column names), **mirror the ones in the angular front-end.** I did this by loading the front-end in visual studio code, drilling down to src/app/model/ and reading the `.ts` file for each entity. Name your java variables the same things as these variables in the `.ts` files.\\n* **Do not** create a separate file for `excursion_cartitem`. We will come back to this later.\\n\\n# Important Notes\\n**Some students have reported strange issues in their application caused by Lombok.** There's currently a note on the course announcements at the bottom announcing compatibility issues with Lombok and this project. However, these versions for Spring Boot and Lombok look to be compatible:\\n```\\nSpring: <version>3.3.6</version>\\nLombok: <version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\n\\nMeaning your dependencies in your pom.xml should look like this:\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\\n<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>\\n<version>3.3.6</version>\\n```\\n\\n```\\n<groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>\\n<artifactId>lombok</artifactId>\\n<version>1.18.36</version>\\n```\\nOnce you have your respective dependencies updated, either refresh maven by clicking the little button that appears in the top right in IntelliJ, or invalidate your caches. Things should be ok from then on.\\nCreating your getters and setters using the IDEs built-in getter and setter generator is also perfectly acceptable.\\nI'd also advise regularly referencing the course announcements since there's a lot of valuable bits in there (usually in response to confusion by other students).\\n\\n**There is one special thing you need to do for the `Division` entity.** Since choosing your division is entirely dependent on what country you select when creating a customer, you need to reactively set the country ID for `Division`. Follow the JavaBits video found in 1.1 in the Zybooks to see what you need to do.\\n\\nOnce you have the entities created, let's work on the database relationships. We have OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships to configure. Again, this is where SQL knowledge will be helpful.\\n\\nTo configure your OneToMany relationships, video 50 in the Udemy shows the whole process, just swap your names for the ones you need for your entities. You'll need to perform the process in the video multiple times until every relationship is established per the UML diagram. For your ManyToMany relationship `excursion_cartitem`, use this video on Udemy: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/7496692#overview) If the link doesn't work, the video is in the course \"Spring framework 5: Beginner to Guru\" and is at section 8 video 137. Additionally, the older D288 guide says this:\\n\\n>MAKE SURE the “inverse side” is on the correct entity, and the “mapped by” side is on the correct entity. This will cause an issue later down the line if you have them flipped.\\n\\nI wasn't really sure how to decide which one was the \"inverse side\" and which one was the \"mapped by\" side. I did some research and found that the entity that is generally considered the \"owner\" of the other entity is where you put the `@JoinTable` tag. Also, the table that's more frequently updated is usually considered the owner. Taking this into consideration, I put the `@JoinTable` tag in `CartItem`, which worked for me.\\n\\nNow for the last part, the enumeration. Create a separate file for this one and use the types found in the ERD Diagram. Make sure you spell the third option as \"canceled\", not \"cancelled\". The database uses \"canceled\", and you're mapping the Cart's `status` property to the database. Then use this article to figure out how to annotate your enumeration in Cart properly: [https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa](https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-persisting-enums-in-jpa) Scroll down until you see “Mapping String Value”.\\n\\nLast step! Go back to your `RestDataConfig.java` file now and fix the import statement.  It should be something like like `com.your.groupname.entities.*`. Get rid of `import edu.wgu.d288_backend.entities.*` if it's still there. For me, IntelliJ fixed this automagically when I opened the file, but that may be because I have automatic imports on.\\n\\nAnd that's it for this task! Before committing and pushing, I'd recommend running your back-end at this point and see if you get any runtime errors. If you do, read the error messages and fix them up because they're likely just syntax errors. You'll also get errors if you typo'd when creating your OneToMany and ManyToMany relationships.\\n\\nOnce you get the back-end running without any errors, commit and push for task D.\\n\\n**Task E:** Finally, another easy step! Watch video 51 in the provided Udemy course and create repository files for ALL of your entity files. Don't do anything with the RepositoryRestResource section. You'll also need to add a `@CrossOrigin` tag above each interface declaration to enable cross-origin support. This tag enables the back-end, which broadcasts on port 8080, to communicate with the front-end, which broadcasts on port 4200.\\n\\nNow to conclude this task, it's time to see if we can connect our back-end and front-end and database. We've got the entities mapped to the database columns, and the field names match the ones in the front-end. Our relationships should all be set according to the UML diagram. Go ahead and run both the back-end and front-end, go to `localhost:4200`, and see if the front-end populates. If something doesn't populate, triple check your column mappings, variable names, and entity relationships. You can see what the front-end is supposed to look like by watching the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive.\\n\\nOnce you've got your front-end and database linked up, commit and push task E.\\n\\n# Section 3\\n\\nNow that we have the front-end and the database linked, let's add the required functionality to the back-end.\\n\\n**This section covers tasks F, G, H, and I of the performance assessment.**\\n\\n**Task F:** Here's the other hard part. It kinda trickles down into tasks G and H since you don't really have a surefire way of testing your solution. Again, don't worry if it's not fully correct; it's expected to make revisions to previous tasks! The corresponding videos from the Udemy course are 204-207.\\n\\nI think the best strategy here is to take it file by file, following the Udemy course. **Create a \"services\" package and put the following 4 files in it:**\\n\\n**Purchase.java:** This is where we will store the customer, cart, and cart items related to a specific purchase. Follow 204 almost exactly, again using `@Getter` and `@Setter` instead of `@Data`. Ignore everything with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`. Futhermore, keep this quote from the old guide in mind:\\n\\n>When following along with these next couple of videos, you should realize that his “order” is our “cart”, and his “OrderItem” is our “CartItem”.\\n\\nCouldn't have said it better myself.\\n\\n**PurchaseResponse.java**: continue watching video 204. Mirror the instructor's file exactly.\\n\\n**CheckoutService.java:** move on to video 205 and skip to about halfway through where the instructor creates this file. Mirror this file to the instructor's as well.\\n\\n**CheckoutServiceImpl.java:** now begins the difficult portion of this task. Continue watching videos 205-207, and let me list out the things you'll be doing differently:\\n\\n* The instructor injects a `customerRepository`, but that's not what we want. In our situation, why would we want to save anything to the customer repository? That would be for saving customer info, not order info. What we DO want to do is associate a customer with a cart, and our `Cart` entity has a Customer ID field. Go ahead and autowire a `customerRepository`.\\n* Remember, his `Order` is our `Cart`, and his `OrderItem` is our `CartItem`. Ignore EVERYTHING that has to do with `shippingaddress` and `billingaddress`.\\n* Don't forget to set the status of the cart to `ordered`. You've got a setter generated for you by lombok (something like `setStatus`) so just use that and pass in the correct enum value. I do this as soon as I get the cart from the purchase object.\\n* Ah yes, the `add` function. This was a bit confusing and I wasn't sure how to implement it. I'll try to break it down.\\n\\nWe need this function for 4 things:\\n1. Confirm we aren't adding a null item.\\n2. Initialize the cart's set for `CartItem` and the customer's variable for `Cart`. Remember, these variables are declared, but aren't defined. And while we have our database relationships defined between our entities, Spring isn't adding our cart items to our cart or our cart to our customer. That's what the service is for!\\n3. Actually add the item to it's respective object. \\n4. Make item recognizes its owner (define what customer owns the cart and what cart owns the cart items). \\nFor this, I used the following code (graciously provided by u/its-cess):\\n```\\n    public void add(CartItem cartItem) {\\n        if (cartItem != null) {\\n            if (cart_items == null) {\\n                cart_items = new HashSet<>();\\n            }\\n            cart_items.add(cartItem);\\n            cartItem.setCart(this);\\n        }\\n    }\\n```\\nThis performs all 4 functions we need. Add this to your `Cart` entity, and modify it to fit your `Customer` entity.\\n\\nEverything else that happens in the videos you should be able to copy.\\n\\nNow again, we have no way of testing if this code actually works, as we don't have a controller to actually grab the data the front-end is sending via our browser. So, once you have all 4 files done and have followed the above steps to the best of your ability, commit and push task F.\\n\\n**Task G:** So the old guide doesn't explain this too well, so I'll go into a bit more depth. Go ahead and run your project and take a look at the front-end. Click the person and then the \"Add Customer\" button. You'll then see a form with a bunch of fields. For each one of those fields, we need to add validations. Although, they don't let us use Spring Boot Validation (because external libraries are not allowed). So all you have to do is track down each variable that corresponds to the field in the front-end and add `nullable = \"false\"` in the `@Column` tag.\\n\\nThe other validation you need is when someone tries to place an order with an empty cart. What you can do here is implement an if/else branch for the return statement of your placeOrder function. You should check if the cart is null, then if the cart's cartItems is null, then lastly if the cart's cartItems are empty. If any of those are true, return an error message saying the cart can't be empty instead of returning an order tracking number. If you don't know what to do for the error message here are a few hints:\\n\\n1. You can't edit the front-end, so it doesn't have anything to do with that.\\n2. Your error message can't crash the program.\\n3. PurchaseResponse returns a string.\\n\\nYou can't test the 2nd validation until your controller is made.\\n\\nCommit and push task G.\\n\\n**Task H:** Watch Udemy video 208. Copy what the instructor does exactly.\\n\\nNow it's time to test if you're getting an order tracking number and if your database tables are updating. Watch the \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" video in the webinar archive to test getting an order tracking number, confirm you're not getting any network errors in your console, and check if your database tables are updating. Also make sure to test your empty cart validation and see if you get your error message.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push task H.\\n\\n**Task I:** This task is where experience with D287 helps out a lot. Remember when you had to create a sample inventory? You're doing the exact same thing here, just with customers. You should be adding 5 customers + the one that's added in the database script for a total of 6. If you need a refresher, this video is helpful: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/spring-framework-5-beginner-to-guru/learn/lecture/17792948#overview) If the link doesn't work, this video is also from “Spring Framework 5: Beginner to Guru” on Udemy, section 2 video 17. Additionally, you can watch the instructor-provided video in D287 on Task E. You can find it on the \"D287 Additional Resources\" page in the Course Search. \\n\\nHere are a few tips for this task:\\n\\n* You can create overloaded constructors for both `Customer` and `Division`, but it isn't necessary. You can use the setter methods created by Lombok if you desire. I created one for `Customer` for cleaner code, but not for `Division`. Keep in mind, you need a no-argument constructor in your entity still, but we have Lombok! Just slap a `@NoArgsConstructor` on there and you'll be good.\\n* Ensure when you're adding your customers, you're initializing every *fillable* field (the ones visible when you create a customer on the website). Don't input manual values for the auto-generated fields.\\n* Confirm all the code that adds the customers only runs if there's less than or equal to one customer in the database. You don't want your customers getting added every time you restart the application. This check should also prevent you from overwriting customer data every time you run the app.\\n\\nAnd while it's not required, you can add a message in your console stating the amount of customers in the database and maybe even print the customer names. I used a logger object, which I added to my BootStrapData class with this line of code: \\n\\n    private static final Logger \\n    logger \\n    = LoggerFactory.\\n    getLogger\\n    (BootStrapData.class);\\n\\nYou can then do stuff like send info messages using `logger.info()` and pass the number of customers in the database with `customerRepository.count()`. This is all optional though.\\n\\nWhat isn't optional is checking your `Customer` table to ensure it populates correctly. Run your application multiple times and ensure the customers appear in the front-end and in the database tables. Ensure your customers aren't getting overwritten when re-running the application, and confirm the customers get added back when re-running the application on a fresh database.\\n\\nOnce everything is working, commit and push part I.\\n\\nThat's the end of the coding portion. **You did it! Congrats!** Now you've just gotta submit.\\n\\n# Submitting the project\\n\\n**Part J:** For this part, follow \"Demonstration of a completed performance assessment\" in the webinar archive exactly. **IF YOU DID NOT DO THE PROJECT IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT, PERFORM THIS PART IN THE LAB ENVIRONMENT!** You really don't want to submit the project having it working on your machine but not the lab environment. Also, make sure you're testing in chrome like the instructor. Confirm you're not getting any extra networking errors and gather all the screenshots, including your repository graph. Submit using the HTTPS GitLab repo link and you're zipped folder containing all your screenshots.\\n\\nIf you have any questions not covered in this guide, please post them below. Other Reddit users and I will try and get to them and answer them accordingly. If a significant update/revision should be made to the guide, please leave a comment suggesting a change. I'll try and keep this guide relevant for at least a little while, but with the new degree plan coming, it will inevitably become superannuated.  \\n\\nIf you followed this guide and passed, **CONGRATS!** This is probably the most technical project I've done so far in my degree, and I had a lot of fun with it. So, I hope this guide made the class enjoyable for you too! Wishing you well in your future studies! 📚🎉  \n",









                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             BSSWE Java Track Monster Guide and Review\\nI finally graduated! After 3 terms, working full time at my job and as a father. I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database & SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching & promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope & out-of-scope), requirements (functional & non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development & testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.  \n",

experienced or heard how this course is low effort, half finished garbage. Well, since they can't be bothered to fix this course, it is up to us to help each other out. This post is my attempt to help fellow students with this project. After stumbling through this project for like a month and a half, I finally finished it and here is my best attempt at a guide.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFirstly, get your IntelliJ Ultimate downloaded, and get your project files on your local machine. Check out my previous post at to get through task step A: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/153wwv8/comment/jv17256/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, so this project basically gives you a web application built using Spring with a Java backend and a myspace looking old school HTML user interface, and your job is to customize the code to meet a customers needs. You need to come up with a shop that will have 5 sample products, and 5 generic parts that can be combined to make those products. They give the example of a bicycle shop that has different bike types for products, like mountain bike/ road bike etc. and then generic parts for those such as seat, handlebars, gears etc. Do not overthink this, just choose something and keep it simple and generic.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo know what the heck is going on, here is some background info. To get something like this to work, it is convenient to use a framework, something to contain all your different files and get them to work together the way we want, while offering tools and libraries to simplify development and let us focus on the logic and features of the application we are creating. Often used with Spring is Spring boot, a sub project of Spring that simplifies things for us even more by using embedded web servers so you don't have to install and configure a separate web server, while also offering auto-configuration, so we have less to do manually to make sure that any files/classes etc that depend on other files/classes/methods etc have the information shared to be able to carry out their functions. This project uses a common design pattern known as MVC (model view controller). This is a way to organize an applications files based on its function which promotes organization, modularization, maintainability, reusability, testability, and improves development efficiency. Now if you have opened your project, it may seem overwhelming the amount of files in there, so I am going to try to tell you what files belong to what part of MVC, and a bit about what they do so you know what you are looking at.  \\n\\n\\n**Model:** represents the applications data and business logic. Encapsulates the core functionality and rules of the app, including data manipulation, validation, and interactions with the database. The files for this project relating to the model are:\\n\\n* Entities: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->domain you have 4 .java files containing entities. These are your classes, for the different types of parts, and for products. Entities are marked with the annotation '@Entity' which tells Spring this is an entity, allowing it to work its magic to make these work the way we want overall for the application.\\n* Repositories: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->repositories you have 4 repository .java files corresponding to the entity files. Repository files allow for CRUD (create read update delete) on the database. These files interact with the database and are marked with '@Repository'. Note that these files extend CrudRepository which eliminates the need for the annotation.\\n* Service: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->service, there are service files and service implementation files. The service files contain declarations but not the definitions, while the implementation files have the definitions to implement the service. Services interact with repositories to retrieve and manipulate data.\\n* Validators: Found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->validators, contains .java files that contains the actual validation logic, and annotation files that allow you to make a custom annotation to easily mark your other files with ('@CustomAnnotation') to get the validation enforced. Code that enforces validation rules and constraints for your data.\\n\\n**View:** responsible for presenting the data to the user and handling user interactions. It encompasses the user interface elements, templates, and visual elements that users interact with. Views receive data from the Model and render it in a way that's suitable for presentation. Views also capture user input and pass it to the Controller for further processing. The files for the view layer are:\\n\\n* HTML Templates: src->main>resources->templates. These are all your html files that contain the format and structure for the webpages you see. This project uses Thymeleaf, a template engine that helps make dynamic html content.\\n* CSS: found in src->main->resources->static->css. This provides additional styling for the webpages to enhance the look and feel.\\n\\n**Controller:** These classes handle user requests, process input, interact with the Model, and determine which View should be rendered. Controllers are annotated with '@Controller'. In general, a controller in a Spring application is a class that handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them, and returns an appropriate HTTP response. Controllers typically have methods annotated with '@RequestMapping'(or other annotations like '@GetMapping','@PostMapping', etc.) to define the URL paths they handle and the HTTP methods they respond to. The controllers are found in src->main->java->com.example.demo->controllers.\\n\\n**Other Notable Files:** There are some files that aren't included in MVC but are still important to recognize. These are:\\n\\n* BootStrapData.java: The purpose of this class is to provide initial data for testing and development, ensuring that there is data to work with when starting the application. This file is located at src->main->java->com.example.demo->bootstrap\\n* application.properties: a configuration file in a Spring Boot application that allows you to configure various settings and properties for your application. It is used to customize the behavior of your application without requiring changes to the source code. \\n* test files: located at src->test, contains files for testing your code.\\n* .gitignore: this file is used to specify files and directories that you want ignored by git when tracking changes in your project. I did not use this file at all for this project. Is found in target directory.\\n* mvn & mvnw: These are files used to ensure the right version of Maven is being used to build the project regardless of whether you have it installed or not. Maven is a build automation and project management tool that simplifies the process of managing and building software projects by providing a structured way to handle dependencies, compilation, testing, and packaging.\\n* pom.xml: is the Project Object Model configuration file used by Maven to define project details, dependencies, and build settings for a Java project.\\n* README.md: is used to provide a brief and informative description of a project, often found at the root of a repository, to help users understand its purpose and usage. We will be using this file to track the changes we make for task steps C thru J.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAlright, hopefully that helps, I was completely lost and overwhelmed at first but hopefully that gives you some background and helps you see how the pieces fit together. If it doesn't make sense yet, it will start to as you work through the project and see how things work together and interact. Anyway, on to the tasks!\\n\\n**NOTE:** to view and test your web app, open your browser and go to localhost:8080. This will show you your webpage in its current state. You must run the application successfully in IntelliJ for this to work. You will be using this a lot to make sure your changes are working the way you want and you are meeting the requirements.  \\n\\n\\n**Task B:** This part is super easy, they want you to create a README file, but there already is one! What I did here was I kept the nice WGU and D287 header stuff deleted the rest, and then I copy and pasted the task requirements from parts C to J so I could type my changes for each part under the step it is a part of.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**NOTE:**  For tasks C - J you have to commit and push with a message to the remote repository after the completion of each step. You are allowed to push more often, but at a minimum you must push after each step is completed and put a brief meaningful message. At the end you will have to get the history and submit it with your zip file. I made a new branch to do all my changes to, and named it working\\_brach, as this is more common than doing work on the main branch. To make a new branch, go to the bottom right of the screen, click the current branch, and it will bring up some options. Click new branch, name it something like working\\_branch, and check the box for checkout branch so that you make it the branch you are working on.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task C:** For this step, you will be working in mainscreen.html. You will need to customize this page to reflect your custom shop choice, changing the titles and headers appropriately. Make sure to log the changes and locations on the README. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message. You can do this by clicking the git tab and then clicking commit, and it should bring up a commit window where your project window usually is, and then you can select what changes to commit, type your message, and select commit & push. Almost every time I did this, I got warnings and it stopped the push, and I had to click push anyway. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task D:** For this part you need to understand some basic html. This step you need to make an about page, and so you will need firstly a template, so create a new html template with all your other templates (when asked if you want to add your new file to git, always say yes). This file will be where you create all the visuals for your about page, where you describe briefly your business and who its for. I just put some super generic stuff about how we care about the customer and giving back etc. I copy and pasted the first 12 or so lines from another html template just so it had the same styling and structure info as the other webpages. I personally tried to match the look of mainscreen.html, but you can make it however you want. Remember to catalogue each change you make in the README.md file. For example, if you add a title for your about page, you would put something like: -about.html: added title 'About' on line 15. You need to say what file, have it under the correct task letter, and say what line(s) the change(s) is(are) on and what the change(s) is(are). When you are satisfied with your about.html, you will need to make a controller for it in the directory with all the other controllers. The controller is being used to map the URL to  the corresponding webpage and guiding Spring on which template to utilize for rendering the content. Remember to annotate your controller with '@Controller' just like in the other controller classes, and you will also need the @GetMapping(\"name\\_of\\_about\\_template\\_here\") in your class definition to connect the template and the url such that you can reach this page and see it by going to localhost:8080/about\\_template\\_name\\_here. Check out the other controller classes to get an idea how for this, or watch a video on it if needed. On mainscreen.html, you will need to add a button that takes you to the about page you created, I just copy and pasted similar code for other buttons and changed the link for it and name to make this work. Similarly, on your about html file you will want to add a link or a button back to the mainscreen. Once you have coded this and ensured it works and looks right on your webpage, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n **Task E:** Now you need to add a sample inventory consisting of 5 products and 5 parts. There is commented out code in the BootStrapData.java file that gives you an example of how to create a part and a product (in separate spots), you can use that and change it to make 5 of each. You either need to add an if statement that checks if the parts count and products count is zero before adding the sample inventory, or you will need to comment your code out after the sample is added to your page so you don't keep adding duplicates. If you don't add the logic to check for this, make sure to make a note somewhere to uncomment this code back out before you submit your project, or it will get sent back as they will not see your sample database get loaded in. (Hint: I used variables for part count and product count and set them equal to their respective repository classes and used the .count() method to see if both were == 0 before adding the sample inventory). Once you are done, commit and push with a message. Make sure you are logging all your changes!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task F:** This step asks you to add a Buy Now button next to the update and delete buttons for your products. The button needs to decrease the inventory of the purchased product by one, and make no changes to the inventory of parts. You need to display a message for failure or success of a purchase. First I would add the button to mainscreen.html in the appropriate spot. There is a table in mainscreen.html that sets up the products table, you will see it referencing tempProduct.name, .price, .inv, and then you will see the update and delete buttons. You will want to add your Buy Now button in here. The button here is a bit tricky as you need it to map to /buyProduct URL (we will make the controller for this later) and you need to set it up for http POST request so it can access and update the inventory amount for purchased products. You also need to pass a hidden input field so that you can pass the tempProduct.id along to the controller. I would post the code for this but I don't want this post to get taken down lol. Next you need to make a new controller to handle the desired behavior of the buy now button. Once you make your controller, make sure to annotate it as a controller. For this controller I added a private ProductRepository object with an '@Autowired' annotation, as the ProductRepository provides methods for interacting with the database which we need to do to decrement the inventory by 1 after purchase, and the annotation injects an instance of ProductRepository into this controller, which allows it to use the methods it needs. Just like the other controllers, we are going to make a public String method, I called it buyProduct. For its input parameters, you need to use the '@RequestParam' annotation to be able to obtain the productID from the product that was purchased over on mainscreen. Next I created an Optional <Product> object that assigns its value to the .findById method of the product repository, using the productID obtained from '@RequestParam'. By using Optional<Product>, the code handles the possibility that the requested product might not exist in the database. It avoids directly returning null when the product is not found, which helps improve code readability and reduces the risk of NullPointerException. This object basically represents whether the product was found in the database or not. Using that, you can set up if statements based on whether that object.isPresent() is true or not, and if it is true, you can create a Product object and set it equal to the optional object.get(). You can then set up an additional if statement that checks if that products inventory (product.getInv) is above 0, if it is then you can set the inventory for it to its current value -1 (decrement the inventory like the instructions wanted). Make sure to save this new value using the product repository .save() method to save the new count to the repository. If this part of the code is reached, then the product had enough in stock to be purchased, its inventory was subtracted by one to reflect a purchase, and now you can generate a success message. There are many ways to do this (as is the case with most of the project), but I personally made a new html template both for a purchase success and a purchase error. You can use a redirect statement in your return statement to the url of your success page for the case that the purchase went through, or to your error page if it did not. You will need to add '@GetMapping' annotations and displayPurchaseSuccess (or error) methods that return to the appropriate url. After the controller is all setup, you make your html templates for the success and error pages if thats the way you chose to do. These can be super simple, basically mine just said purchase successful or purchase error in big letters when the page loaded. When everything is working and looking the way you want, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task G:** In this step you have to add max and min inventory fields for parts, modify your sample inventory to show the max and min inventory, and update both the part forms to have additional inputs for the max and min inventory. Then they want you to rename the database file, and add code that enforces that the inventory is between the max and min values. First go to Part.java, and add the minInv and maxInv fields (name em whatever you want), you can also use the same '@Min' annotation as the other fields to enforce that it cannot be below zero, and have a message with it. Be sure to also add a new constructor that includes these new fields, and make getter and setter functions for them. Next go back to BootStrapData.java and add max and min inventory values for your sample inventory parts. Then for both InhousePartForm and OutsourcedPartForm, add text inputs for both max and min inventory. You can probably figure out how to put it in there just by seeing how the other fields are put in there and copying it but changing as necessary. Then rename the database file, it will look something like this **spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db** you can find it in file explorer or finder and right click it and rename it to whatever you like. In the application.properties file, you will need to rename it there as well and make sure they match. Next I would create a method in Part.java that checks if an inventory is valid, by returning true if the inventory falls between the max and min values, and returns false otherwise. For both inhouse and outsourced part controller files, add logic that uses the isInvValid method you created to generate an error message if the inventory is outside of range. I used BindingResult to reject bad values with a message, look into this for the error messaging. Once this is working as expected and desired, commit and push with a message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task H:** This step wants you to add additional error messages and more specific error messages, one for if the inventory is below the minimum, one for if the inventory is above the maximum, and one for if adding/updating a product would cause an associated part to fall below the minimum. This isn't too bad, adding some more if else type logic to both inhouse and outsourced part controllers will take care of the first two conditions I listed. For the last requirement, I edited EnufPartsValidator.java with some additional requirements in the if statement that returns false to check if any of the parts for the product would fall below their minimum if the product was made (Hint: p.getInv() - 1 < p.getMinInv()). I also updated the error message from ValidEnufParts to be more specific. When you are happy with the results and everything has been tested and working, commit with a message and push. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task I:** Add two unit tests to the PartTest class for the maximum and minimum inventory fields. The course resources has a video for this. You go to the file, and use the '@Test' annotation, and then make two tests that look similar to the tests already in this file. For min, you can set the minimumInv to a number that you expect to be the lowest to be used for the program, its just an arbitrary test number. Then you use partIn and set its value to the variable you just assigned, and use assertEquals() to make sure that it works as expected. Repeat for partOut. Do all this again but for maximumInv. Thats it for this one. When it is working, commit and push with message.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Task J:** Remove the class files for any unused validators. This one was so simple it had me doubting myself. When you open the validators, it will tell you how many usages intellij recognized for them. One of them had no usages so I deleted that one. It was really that simple lol. Commit and push with a message. This is the last step that needs to be tracked in the read me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow double check you meet all the rubric requirements, watch the completed project video from the course resources and make sure you got all the right stuff, and when you are satisfied and everything is working, export your project to a ZIP. Next on Gitlab, go to the code tab on the left hand side, expand it with a click and then select repository graph. This shows your commit and push history and must be turned in. Use print button and then specify print to PDF, and save it to your computer. You must turn this in with your project ZIP. Finally, get the url for your gitlab by clicking the blue clone button and copying the https url. When you submit, you need the ZIP, the repository graph, and the URL. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI hope this guide helps, please let me know of any mistakes or typos, I wanted to do this quickly and move on to my next course. If you have questions feel free to ask, but just know I stumbled my way through this and by no means to I understand everything or am an expert. This guide does not constitute the right way, best way, only way, or most efficient way to do this project. It is just what worked for me. I tried to tell you as much as possible without just giving things away and getting in trouble lol.  When you guys finish this course, make sure to let them know honestly how you feel about the course in the end of course survey! Best of luck. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;  \n",



Adventure\\nJuly seems to be a good month for me. July 2020, I graduated with a Bachelor's Degree from WGU in Business Management. After that was done, I wrote this post, to give my take on the \"Sort of\" acceleration I did through my undergrad studies. It's a long read...but...if you want context for this post...feel free to give it a skim: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu\\_bs\\_in\\_business\\_management\\_the\\_sortof/geijacp/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/hnthx6/wgu_bs_in_business_management_the_sortof/geijacp/?context=3)\\n\\nFast forward to July 2021...and I just completed my MBA at WGU as well. Like I said...July seems to be my jam. My first Graduate Term at WGU started in October 2020, so I accelerated two years of course work, into a little less than 10 months. Not too shabby. \\n\\nNow, you've likely seen other posts. \"I accelerated my Bachelors degree (or MBA) in 2 weeks\" or something of the like. My point here, is the same as it was last time: I'm not racing anyone. I applaud those who were able to do in minutes what took me months. However, for those who are still with me here...keep in mind I work full time in the Tech sector as a Senior Program Manager, I coach high school athletics on the side, and I have a family that I happen to enjoy spending time with. That's why I title my posts as a \"sort of\" acceleration. I don't have every hour of my day to devote to classwork so I can hammer out 11 classes in 11 days; but I want to give back to the WGU subreddit, because I got a lot of assists from these posts and I want to help others, who may only be looking for a kick in the arse that they can do it too. I did what I could in the evenings to devote to my school work, and on weekends too. But, I really didn't sacrifice an entire weekend to school at any point. I enjoy sipping my coffee. I also just happened to have an Appendicitis during my MBA Adventure, so that didn't exactly help my cause! \\n\\nI gave a lot of advice and pro-tips in my Bachelor's Degree post above. But, I'll reiterate the important ones here, up front:   \\n\\n\\n**1)** Get a Business Calculator, (I bought the BA II Plus) and learn it. *Know thy calculator*. It will save you a LOT of time. \"But, hey OP. I have a graphing calculator. I'm good.\" Sure, but, you could be better off. The Business Calculator, when you get into the Financing Courses will legit save you a ton of time. \\n\\n**2)** Be nice to your exam proctors. They work in a call center for God knows how many hours a day, watching people take exams. Sometimes they'll ask you to do something that no other proctor asks you to do. Just, go with it. Sometimes I was asked to take off my Smart Watch, sometimes, I wasn't. Sometimes I was asked to take my hand away from my face during exams (I tend to rest my chin on my hands during exams); other times, I wasn't asked to do that. Sometimes I quietly talk through an exam question to myself, and sometimes the proctor would chime in and ask me if I was talking to someone in the room, and I'd have to rotate the camera to show I was alone; and sometimes it didn't matter at all. But, there's no need to make your proctored exams more stressful then they may already be. Just go with the flow. They're human, just like you and I are, and there isn't a single proctor out there like \"I'm totally going to try and get this person to fail their exam\". Be kind. \\n\\n**3)** Be patient when you submit papers for grading. They have three days to return it to you. *Pro-Tip*: if you can avoid it, try to get your papers submitted before the end of the month. There is legitimately a term ending at the end of every month; so the volume increases a lot at the end of the month. I generally found papers I'd turn in, in the middle of the month would get graded in 12-36 hours; whereas at the end of the month, you can bank on it taking all three days. For whatever it's worth to you. \\n\\n**4)** Regarding papers: I said it before, I will repeat myself: Follow. The. Rubric. Every. Single. Word. Of. It. If you deviate from the Rubric, it doesn't matter how much you write, or how eloquent you are, or what your experience is in professional writing in your career. You will get your paper returned. You could write War and Peace, and get your paper returned. Or, you could follow the Rubric, write two pages, and pass. Just give them what they ask for, because that's what they're looking for to grade.\\n\\n**5)** It's okay to fall behind a bit, or to stall out a bit. My term started in October 2020. I didn't even get to open the first course until November, because of a work deadline. You can catch up. In the MBA program, you have six months to complete three classes. Anything else, is gravy. \\n\\n**6)** Take the Pre-Assessment straight-away when starting a class with a proctored exam. Have no fear. There is no penalty for getting crushed on the Pre-Assessment, and there's no limit to the number of times you can take it. But, you want the Assessment Report at the end of it. It will not only tell you the weight of each section to better help you study, but will also give you an answer key to see what you missed. As a bonus, if you pass it, it unlocks your Proctored Exam (Objective Assessment/OA) right away, so you can schedule it. I took the Pre-Assessment straight-away for every class I had with an exam, and it helped me shore up where I was weak, and I saved time by not studying sections I aced. \\n\\n**7)** Get a Quizlet account. You're welcome.\\n\\nHere we go:   \\n\\n\\nThere are eleven courses to complete for your MBA. Six of them have a Proctored Exam, five are written papers. The Data Driven Decision Making course (C207) has both Proctored Exam, and two papers to write. I'm going through them, in the order I took them, over the course of ten months (one, six-month term, and then three and a half months of a second term). I took some cues from a post by [https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sleyk2010/) and his Mega Thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba\\_master\\_of\\_business\\_administration\\_course\\_mega/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/gmxkxo/mba_master_of_business_administration_course_mega/). I always like to give credit where it's due. They had a bit of a different journey than I did, but we also had some similarities. But, I did draw some inspiration from their post, which is why it looks similar! \\n\\n**Managing Organizations and Leading People (C200)** *– Two Papers*   \\nThey ease you in with a pretty easy class up front. First up, get the Signature Themes Assessment out of the way. I think it took me about a half hour ish. Download the result, and start in on your papers. I wrote both papers over the course of two days. Paper 1 wants you to talk about the Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Paper 2 is for you to use a situation with a real organization, but you have to redact the info, and make up fake names. Then you write about a leader you know in the org. No reinvention of the wheel here. \\n\\n**Managing Human Capital (C202)** *– One Proctored Exam (OA)*   \\nThis class was super chill. Honestly, anyone who works in a professional environment will find the majority of the content here as common workplace knowledge. Not necessarily every word, but you know what I mean. I took the pre-assessment straight-away without looking at a single word of the course, passed it, and then scheduled my OA for that weekend to give me a couple days to study where I was weak. Took my OA a couple days later, and passed. \\n\\n**Management Communication (C204)** *– One Paper, One PowerPoint & Video + One Executive Summary*   \\nPaper 1 involves writing up a few emails and letters to your staff, your industry contact and your shareholders of your company that distributes a hot and fancy new product, depending on your chosen scenario. you pick. This is a class to have fun with. Level of Difficulty is not high at all. After Paper 1, you make a PowerPoint with a few slides. Follow. The. Rubric. Then you make a Panopto video. It's very easy. You download and install the Panopto (or use the web version). When it opens, add your PowerPoint you created, and start recording your presentation. My video was about 8 1/2 minutes, and I passed on the first attempt. Then write your Executive Summary of your PPTX and submit the lot. This all took me about a work week in the evenings, but if you had a weekend you could probably hammer it out in a full day, maybe two.\\n\\n**Marketing (C212)** *– One Paper*   \\nI've seen other posts calling this paper a monster. I respectfully disagree. Mine was ten pages, including the title page, table of contents and references. So, my actual content was seven pages long. Just follow the Rubric. I've seen other posts where they wrote 16+ pages. They must reeeeeeeeeally love writing more than I do. I don't add a lot of fluff. Just write what they ask for. You are tasked with writing a proposal for a hot new product from any of seven provided industries. (I work in the Technology sector, so I chose Technology.) This took me about a week, but I started this class the day after Thanksgiving. So, between Turkey Coma and Black Friday (which, let's be honest...due to COVID-19, there wasn't really a Black Friday, as much as there was me not wanting to look at school while I made leftover stuffing...and watched Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer...)\\n\\nI'm grouping the next two together. C213 and C214. Here comes that need for the Business Calculator. Friendly Reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Let it do the work for you. My best advice is this: Do whatever you must with your Program Mentor to get them to schedule these two back-to-back. Bribe them, beg them, or simply ask them. Taking C214 immediately after C213 is a game changer, as they tie into one another like Cookies and Cream. I asked my mentor about it; he sort of waffled; so I asked again, and he adjusted my Degree Plan so I could take them back-to-back. \\n\\n**Accounting for Decision Makers (C213)** *– One OA*  \\nThere are some calculations and math, but not too terribly much. I've seen other posts that say \"don't worry about the math, just focus on all the other class material and you'll be good\". False. Disagree. Nope. Spend time on the math. There's enough math on the exam that if you bomb the math, you're going to essentially need to be perfect on the rest of the exam to pass. I have a strategy on any sort of Finance, Statistics, or Math exams that include theory questions as well. I do the non-math related questions first. If I get to a question that includes an equation, I skip it, and come back to it. Save all the math to last, that way once I switch my brain to calculations, I don't have to switch it back. For me, that's helps bring down the stress level. (Having a beer with me during the exam also helps. Just saying.) I used the same strategy for Financial Management. This one took me four days, because I had a weekend in there that I could devote 2-3 hours at a time to, here and there. Otherwise, probably would have taken a week or so, with after work studying.\\n\\n**Financial Management (C214)** – *One OA*   \\nAnother reminder: *Know thy calculator.* Especially if you've never used a financial calculator before. All the formulas you need will be given to you on the Pre-Assessment and the OA, you don’t have to remember any of them. You'll find many things from C213 carry over here, so that's nice...and the reason I say do whatever you can to take this immediately after C213. Memorize the Financial Concepts as best you can. The math won’t be crazy tough, especially if you *Know thy calculator*. There are more non-math questions than there are finance math questions, but don't skimp on learning the math. Last thing you want is to start second guessing your non-math question answers, because you're not feeling too confident about the Finance Math questions. This one took me two weeks, an hour here and an hour there. \\n\\n**Ethical Leadership (C206)** – *Three Papers*   \\nI admit it. Writing papers bores me to death. With an exam, I can get in, hammer it out, and be done. Not so much with papers. But, c'est la vie. Another easy one, just a time suck because of having to write not one, not two, but ***three*** papers. Blah. First up, do the “Ethical Lens Inventory” task in the course itself. Pretty sure this took me a half hour or so. For Paper 1, write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know. I used someone I used to work for. But, I've seen other posts that they wrote about Lincoln, etc. Write about different leadership concepts. For Paper 2, write about social responsibility and leadership. For Paper 3, write about the code of ethics and its various leadership applications. All three papers, including citations, was a total of 21 pages of writing. Took me two weeks, but in fairness, I was doing this right before Christmas, and decorating the tree, watching National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, and wrapping presents took priority. I'm not sorry. :-)\\n\\n**Data-Driven Decision Making (C207)** – *Two Papers and One OA*   \\nI've read other posts basically calling this class The Devil. Like, bust out the Exorcism for this class, and burn it at the stake for heresy. Honestly, I didn't think it was all that horrible. But, I enjoy data, so to each their own. It took me three weeks. First, form a hypothesis, then you complete Paper 1, which is a form they provide, and turn it in. Then, the data fun starts. Follow the instructions and design a way to test the hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis option from the list. I will say this, don't overly complicate things, regardless of how much you like data. Use the T-Test. It's the simplest one, requiring the least amount of data, and therefore has the least friction. You could choose others, but that's like deciding to run a full marathon when you registered for a half-marathon. Not like you're going to get two medals for finishing. Anyways, plot the numbers in Excel, and calculate the data. You need 15 sources for 30 data points. (*Pro-Tip*: Make sure you have the add-on installed in Excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions if you don't). You have to write Paper 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the chart and support it. I was able to get data from my wife's place of work, so this probably made things easier for me too. After Paper 2 passes, then it's time for the OA. Remember when I said \"Get a Quizlet account\" up above? You should use it here. If you're not a data person, take your time. Data isn't an easy topic for many people, so put on your Patience Hat, and grab a beer while you study. \\n\\n**Operations Management (C215)** – *One OA*   \\nSo, I've spent some of my career in Ops Management, so I breezed through this one. I wish I had some pearls of wisdom to share here. I was done in four days, and that's only because the closest OA I could schedule when I wasn't at work...or at near midnight was four days after I took the Pre-Assessment. Topics included supply/demand, operations and employee functions, and process improvement. But again, I've worked in this field, and when I passed the Pre-Assessment with Exemplary across the board, I didn't even bother to crack the study material. So, you may want to search for another sub-Reddit thread that goes into detail here.  \\n\\n**Global Economics for Managers (C211)** – *One OA*   \\nIf you pay even a small bit of attention to business environments, the economy, currency exchange, global corporation behavior, this won’t be a headache. A lot of the content in this class was common knowledge on my part. I took the pre-assessment right away as per usual, then scheduled the OA for later that week. Took about 6 days from start to finish. But, this was my last OA, and a cause for celebration! \\n\\n**MBA Capstone (C216)** – *One Business Simulation + Three Papers*   \\nPaper 1 is a PowerPoint presentation + Panopto video (Exactly like C204 above). Task 2 is a pretty lengthy paper as a Stockholder Report (mine was 19 pages); Paper 3 is basically submitting your resume, your LinkedIn Profile, and a tiny paper on what you learned during the MBA that helped you on the Capstone Simulation (mine was 5 total pages, including the cover page and Table of Contents). \\n\\nOf all the courses I have taken with WGU, including my Undergraduate course load, this was by far my most favorite. An actual workplace simulation of opening your own small business. There is a lot of work to do for this course, as there should be for a culminating final of a graduate level degree program. All up, I spent close to three weeks on this sucker. I could have done it faster, but I wanted my presentations to be air tight. Also...above I mentioned an Appendicitis. Well, this is when it hit, was during my Capstone. So, take that into consideration as well. Start off with the simulation. The simulation consists of a start-up business and it's first six quarters of operation that you have to get through. After you get to the end of Q4, you have to stop and that is the information you use for Paper 1 (the PPTX presentation/video) to justify your decisions you've made up to that point.  You actually cannot progress to Q5 and Q6 in the simulation until you pass Paper 1. Don't forget: Follow. The. Rubric. To. The. Letter. This is basically a sales pitch to potential investors in your business. Also, this is where you have to be in professional dress for the camera, so ditch the hoodie and put on a collared shirt. *Pro-Tip 1*: Submit Paper 1, then submit Q4 in the Simulation, in that order. Don't submit your Q4 decisions before turning in the Paper. *Pro-Tip 2*: Do the \"Final Check\" each quarter before you submit your results. Don't deviate from that. You can really screw yourself if you muck something up and submit it. The Final Check looks for errors. Once you pass Paper 1, you'll be able to move on to Q5 and Q6. \\n\\nNext, you'll complete the final two quarters, then comes Paper 2, the Stockholder Report. To beat the long dead horse, Follow. The. Rubric. This isn't going to be a short paper, so buckle up, and knuckle down. This paper is written as a narrative, so don't use the Bullet Points from the Task 2 explanations. You don't want it written as a Book Report; you want to tell the graders a story about why you did what you did, and when you did it, and why you did it.  You'll download reports from the simulation, and take screenshots, and have appendices. But, you can do it, because you're storytelling. Since you made the decisions along the way, you know why you did what you did. You just have to explain it, like you're telling a story about it. I found it to be very fun, and I learned quite a bit by doing it. Again, easily my most favorite class I took at WGU. Once this one is submitted, you're basically in the clear. All the grinding work is done, and Paper 3 awaits...and...they sure do lob you a softball on this one to swing at.\\n\\nPaper 3 is writing a quick explanation of of three competencies you used throughout the MBA program that helped you successfully complete the simulation. You'll then create a SMART goal about your career. Then you discuss and attach three artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree, certification or other that you have) that tie into the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you succeed in the future. (I used my undergrad degree, and two professional certifications I have - my Lean Six Sigma Black Belt and my PMP Certification as my three.) Then update your resume (make sure WGU is listed as the latest school with the expected degree end month and year). Then, print off your LinkedIn profile as a PDF (or create a profile if you don't have one). But...don't trip at the finish line! **Follow. The. Rubric.** You don't want the final thing you have to do to be having to re-do a cupcake Paper because you hit Auto-Pilot. Submit the lot. Once you punch submit that last time, sit back and remember Advice Point 3 from above, about being patient while they grade papers. Head to the pub, and drink a well earned beer. Maybe add some Chili-Cheese Fries, for posterity. Just sit and wait to see the good news email hit your Inbox with that glorious subject line \"**You Passed!**\" You did it!!! You made a choice to get your MBA...and now...it's yours! Your program mentor will call or email you very soon. They'll gush about how awesome you did. You'll get an email from Records, that your Mentor submitted you for graduation. Fill that application out when the email comes through. It'll take a couple days to process your degree; and within a couple weeks, you'll get a digital degree you can use online, and shortly thereafter, a package from your Mail Carrier with a super rad piece of paper within, declaring that WGU certifies you to be a master of all things business administration related!\\n\\nCongratulations to you, you're now the proud owner of a Graduate Degree. Now, when you see career opportunities that say \"MBA Required\"; you get to smile; and that's a pretty rad feeling. \\n\\nAnd to you...yes you...reading this wondering if you should enroll. You have obligations. You don't know if you can carve out the time. You work yourself to the bone, and barely have time to sleep. You can do it. I legit work 50+ hour weeks, then I go coach high school sports, then I like to have free time and spend it with my family. Oh...one other thing...I also run marathons competitively. Do you know how long a 23 mile training run takes on a Sunday morning? You don't want to know. But, I made a decision. I knew I could sacrifice some time to open doors that were closed to me previously. Because, it doesn't take forever to get that MBA. It only takes a little time, right now. The longer you delay, the longer it will be before you finish. \\n\\nYou can do it. You can. You just have to make the choice. I don't know you. I will never meet you. I don't know your story, or how you got to where you are right now that lead you to this post. But...I believe in you. But, me believing in you isn't good enough. YOU have to believe in you too. So, stop reading this, and get cracking on that MBA. It's already printed off. It just needs to know your name so it can find it's way to your mailbox and live out it's days, decorating your wall in a diploma frame. :-)\\n\\nGood luck!  \n",





classes)\\nThis is a guide to how I did my **MBA** at WGU (in **19 Days)**\\n\\n**I  moved my post over from the other subreddit, as I wanted to  specifically help people who are looking for information related to the  Business degree, specifically, the MBA.**\\n\\nThis  is a full, per course, write up of how I experienced each course, and  what I did to pass. This is only to let people know how “I” did it.  Please don’t take this as a “be all end all”. I take no responsibility  for your progress, and everyone has to put in their work. I would love  to offer tips and pointers, but I will not send “example” papers of any  kind. Please don’t ask. You gotta put in the work and earn it. You can  do it, but remember that everyone is different.\\n\\nI  will however, link you to a blank APA template I used for all my  papers.

If  you are planning to start soon and wanna break my record, Go for it!  Also, if you are already started, but wanna try to accelerate, hopefully  a little from this write-up can help you too! The goal is to finish,  even if you take a long time. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t go fast!  I knew I could do it, so I did it for my personal goals, however,  anyone can accelerate! But above all else, the goal is to finish. I  personally loved to come to reddit and see people accelerate long before  I even started, and I learned a lot from here, so I wanted to give back  a bit of what I learned from the program. Those in the MBA can use  this, and those in the MSML degree can use this for the cross-classes  relevant to them. That being said, I hope this helps someone! :.)\\n\\nBefore  we begin, you must know and memorize the three commandments of WGU’s  coursework. If you don’t learn these essential commandments, you will  suffer greatly! Please familiarize yourself with them before starting  your coursework!\\n\\n*The Three Commandments of WGU Coursework*\\n\\n***1st Commandment*** *- Papers/PA’s: Thou shalt follow thy* ***Rubric***\\*,  that thy paper might not be returned for revision. If thou avoid-est  this rule, and doth not pay attention to this commandment, thou wilt-est  re-write thy paper a thousand times, for the evaluator wilt-est not  pass thine paper unless thou follow-est the rubric.\\*\\n\\n***2nd Commandment*** *- Exams/OA’s: Thou shalt study thy flashcards and thy study guides, that thou may-est* ***pass thy pre-assessment on thine first try***\\*.  If thou heedest not this warning, thou wilt-est delay thy scheduling of  thine OA, for thou wilt need to retake the pre-assessment and pass  before thou art able to take the OA.\\*\\n\\n***3rd Commandment*** *Exams and Papers: Be-est thou not discouraged if thine paper returneth for revision, nor if thou faileth an exam.* ***Study thou again***\\*,  and retake. Retake-est thou again if possible, in no more than 1 to 2  days as thy strength allows. For the paper that returneth, check-est  thou thine evaluator’s comments to see-eth what thou hast missed. Then  add thou in the missed or omitted work, and resubmit. Resubmit-est thou  thy paper in the\\* ***same day*** *if thy strength allows.*\\n\\nLet’s begin!\\n\\nORA1 – Orientation – **Super Easy, 30 min pip of a class. 1 short Form to fill out**.  If you are a regular reader of WGU’s reddit group, or if you already  joined the Facebook group, and is somewhat of an avid “pre-reader” of  the program and the school, and know most of what the school entails,  then don’t bother going through the course material on this one. Just  skip the course content. Just go to the assessment task, download the  template and fill it out. Answer the questions according to how you feel  and your situation in life. Should take you no more than 20-30 mins.  Fill in your time of day for study, work, sleep and otherwise. Try to  identify 20 hours of study. I filled mines out as Sunday 5 hours +  Saturday 5 hours + Mon-Fri 2 hours each day = 20 hours of study a week.  Make sure all questions are answered. Your time for study should be  filled out appropriately and then submit. Done. Forget going through the  9 units of videos and stuff in the course content. Unless, your super  excited to start, and just want to.\\n\\nC200 – Managing Organizations and Leading People – **Super Easy class. 2 Papers, no tests**.  First, find and go to the link for the Signature Themes Assessment,  then go to the link and take the assessment. Should be about 20-30 mins  or so. Then download the result to your pc as a pdf. I wrote Task 1 and  Task 2 in the same day and submitted it that same night. Task 1 was the  first paper I wrote in a long time, so task 1 took me about 5 hours to  complete since I had to get back in the groove. Task 1 talks about the  Signature Themes Assessment and your personal leadership style. Task 2  took about 4 hours to write. Task 2 has you come up with a real  organization, but you have to anonymize the info, and make up names.  Then you talk about a leader you know who works in the organization.  Follow the rubric. Writing ability will vary per person of course. In  college, I could write a 10-page paper in about 2 hours. Now, I can do  it in about 4 hours. Most people write a little slower, but as long as  you follow the rubric, you will pass.\\n\\nC202 – Managing Human Capital – **Super Easy Class. 1 Exam, No papers.**  This class was super easy for me. I think that anyone who works in a  professional environment will find the majority of the content of this  class as common sense and common knowledge. Not all of it, but the  majority of the content. I took the pre-assessment without studying, and  passed it, and then just studied my wrong answers and then scheduled  the OA (exam) the same day, and took it and passed. I didn’t use any  other resources. Now, if you want to pass the pre-assessment on the  first try, go to the quizlet I linked below and study the questions. ***That’s all I’m saying.*** **The importance**  of passing the pre-assessment on the first try is because it “opens”  the OA, or in other words, it automatically approves you to take the OA.  If you fail the pre-assessment, you have to spend time to take the  pre-assessment again, and this will delay you a lil’ bit. So, if you  can, try to pass all your pre-assessments on the first try. Go here:  [**https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl**](https://tinyurl.com/vycytvl)\\n\\nC204 – Management Communication – **Very Easy Class. 1 Paper, 1 PowerPoint Presentation and Video + 1 Executive Summary**.  This class was also fairly easy. Task 1 involves writing up a couple of  imaginary emails and letters to staff, your industry contact and your  imaginary shareholders of your fictional company that distributes a new  product, depending on the scenario you pick. Just have fun with it. I  made up a ton of names to make myself laugh while I was writing the  task. My assistant manager was Karen Ketchup, and her assistant  secretary’s name was Tom Mustard. :.) So, don’t worry, this is a cake  class. Its not hard at all. After writing task 1, you make a PowerPoint  with a few slides. Follow the rubric directions. Then you make a video,  using the panopto system. Its easy. You download and install the panopto  program. Then make sure you are logged into WGU student portal. Then  when it opens, it will ask you to add your PowerPoint you created, and  then you start recording when ready. The video can be less than 7  minutes. (I did a 5 min video and passed just fine.) Save the video to  your computer, and edit it if you need to. Then write up an executive  summary (just a simple one-page summary) of the PowerPoint, then submit  it, along with your PowerPoint presentation slides and the video where  you presented the slides. Done. I did this all in one day.\\n\\nC206 – Ethical Leadership – **Fairly Easy, but borderline tedious, 3 Papers, no Exams**.  This class is not really hard, just tedious. You have to write 3  papers. Before you start writing though, go and find the “Ethical Lens  Inventory” link in the course content and do that first. It is about  20-30 mins. Could be faster or slower depending on how fast you work.  Then download and save your result to your computer as a pdf. For task  1, you write about a famous leader who you admire, or someone you know.  Try to find a famous or well-known person who is considered a leader. I  chose FDR, you can use Abraham Lincoln if you want. Heck, use Trump. To  each their own. Then you talk about different concepts pertaining to  leadership styles etc. Again, Follow the rubric. For task 2, you write  about social responsibility and leadership. For task 3, you write about  the code of ethics and how it applies to leadership. Pretty easy, just a  lot of writing in this class makes it somewhat tedious. Wrote all 3  papers and submitted in the same day, but it was a boor. I took the next  day off.\\n\\nC207 – Data-Driven Decision Making – **Very Difficult Class, 2 Papers (1 form and one paper) + an Exam**.  This F’in class, Son. This freaking class was the most difficult for me  in this program. The finance management class was nothing compared to  this shit class. First, you have to form a business question, or  hypothesis, then you fill out task 1 (which is a form) and submit. Then  you have to follow the instructions and design a way to test the  hypothesis, using a statistical data analysis test from the list of  tests. Do yourself a damn favor, and choose the easiest one, **the t-Test**.  Anything else, and you are asking for bloody murder. Once you decide on  your test, then you have to plot the numbers in excel, and calculate  the data. You need 15 sources for roughly 30 data points. Yes, 15  separate freaking sources. If you can somehow pull the data you need  from one source online or otherwise for the t-Test, then sure, but  depending on your business question or hypothesis, you will most likely  need to get data points from 15 separate sources to test your  hypothesis. You also have to make sure you have the add-on installed in  excel to do the statistical analysis. The class gives you instructions  and videos to help, so don’t worry. Then you have to create one or two  charts to put into task 2 to support your data. Speaking of which, you  have to write task 2 with all the sources and data you used to make the  chart and support it. Oh, please remember to make a proper ***References***  page. The evaluators wanna see where you got all 30 data points from.  Please, please, follow your rubric. This class is not easy at all. At  least for me, I bust my table in frustration at this insane class. :.(  Once done with task 2, then you got the even harder OA. There are  quizlets that help you prepare for the OA. Study them please! Google  “C207 WGU Quizlet” and plenty will come up. Hint: Try to study the  quizlets where the number of flashcards match the number of test  questions or close to it for the PA. That’s all I’m saying. Now, I’m not  writing this because I want to scare people, but for this particular  class, you gotta be ready. No way around this. Unless you know and love,  love, love statistics and data research with statistical methods and  data collection and data crunching, you gotta study and prepare. I had  ZERO experience in business whatsoever, so for me it was tough, if you  have some experience, maybe you can do it in less time. **This is the only class**  I will tell you to look at some of the course content and chapter  quizzes. I consider myself smart and this freaking class took me 3  freaking days. Geez.\\n\\nC211 – Global Economics for Managers – **Fairly Medium to a touch hard class for most, but not terrible, 1 Exam only, no papers**.  I know a lot of people struggle a little with this class, but for me,  it was fairly easy. Took pre-assessment after studying flashcards,  passed, studied pre-assessment questions for what I got wrong, and  scheduled OA same day. Took and passed. If you pay attention to things  in real life, like the economy, currency exchange rates, global business  and global corporation behavior etc., then this class won’t be bad. A  lot of the content in this class was common knowledge for me, especially  in this current political climate with the current president and the  state of the economy. Generally speaking, I just studied the  pre-assessment, and got a grasp of how the questions would be asked,  then if there were concepts that I wasn’t familiar with, I just googled  and read about it until I was familiar. Most times, it was 1 to 2 links  of reading per unfamiliar concept. Totally doable in one day.\\n\\nC212 – Marketing – **Easy, but slightly tedious Class, 1 Monstrous long paper, no Exams**.  This class was easy, but tedious if you don’t enjoy writing. I actually  love writing and it was a little boorish. You will only need to write 1  paper. But the paper is a doozy. If you follow the rubric and write it  correctly, you are looking at about 13-16 pages of fun. No kidding. I  love that this class is only one paper though. You develop a proposal  for a new product. Then you follow the rubric and type the shit out of  it. Totally doable in a day if youre dedicated, but dont fell bad if you  take longer. I started from morning, and was done typing by  mid-afternoon. Total time was roughly 8 hours or so of typing. I did  take breaks in between during the day. Once done, proof-read for  punctuation and grammar, then submit.\\n\\nC213 Accounting for Decision Makers – **Medium to Hard Class, depending on familiarity and/or ability, 1 Exam, no papers**.  This class turned out to be pretty ok. It wasn’t as hard as people were  making it out to be. At least for me. It had some calculations and  math, but not a lot. It was mostly concepts. The quizlets you find will  mostly help you pass. If you don’t get the math too clearly, just keep  trying it over and over till you at least understand why its calculated  that way. Ultimately, my test didn’t have much math so to speak, mostly  theory concepts. You can probably get away with just focusing on getting  the theory questions right and ignoring the math. But be careful. For  me, I took the pre-assessment after studying about 3 separate quizlets,  passed, then of course studied what I got wrong on the pre-assessment.  Then I scheduled the OA the same day. During the test, I focused on the  theory questions, and skipped any math questions I couldn’t figure out.  Then when I got to the end, I had time left, and then I went back and  took my time and tried to figure out the math. That way, I wasn’t  stressed. If I still couldn’t figure it out, I guessed and moved the  hell on. I passed first try. I did the same for Financial Management.\\n\\nC214 – Financial Management – **Kinda hard-ish, but doable if you prepare. 1 Exam, No papers**.  For C214, I spent a little time studying and learning the BA 2 plus  calculator, about 2 hours or so. This was worth it, as I had never used a  financial calculator before, so I spent about 2 hours learning that  alone. For this class, you don’t have to memorize **ANY**  formulas. They give you all you mostly need to know. Believe it or not,  I also used basic omission statistics to pass financial management,  same as Accounting. I literally went through the test, and when I got a  serious math question I couldn't figure out, I skipped and bookmarked  it. When I was done, I went back and counted how much I skipped. Then I  didn't kill myself busting my head for the answer. Why waste time? I  just guessed and moved on. Turns out, I only got about 3 very serious  financial calculation questions on the whole test, and the rest of  questions more focused on theory. So out of 70 or so questions, only 3  math questions I couldn't figure out? That's a tiny percentage of the  test! I took my chances. I focused on making sure I got my theory  questions right. And I passed on my first try. This class is doable,  just read some quizlets, and sort out any answers that don’t make sense  and memorize the right one, as some quizlets I have found, **especially for this class in particular**,  to not be fully accurate. So just be careful. Study the pre-assessment  as well. Memorize the concepts. The math won’t be as crazy. If you can  figure out the math, then sure, do it. But if not, don’t kill yourself.  Focus on getting the theory questions right, and you will pass. There  are simple calculations and complicated ones. Answer the simple ones,  skip the crazy ones till your done with the rest. Then, if you can’t  come to the answer, just guess to the best of your ability and move on.  Trust yourself, and submit. You will pass. Done in one day.\\n\\nC215 – Operations Management – **Fairly medium-ish to hard for some people, 1 Exam, no Papers**.  I actually loved this class. It was my favorite to study. The majority  of the concepts was plain common knowledge for me. Supply and demand,  operational function, employee function, process improvement etc. I  found the test easy and doable, but I have read where people have had  some trouble. I supplemented googling concepts I was unfamiliar with,  along with quizlets. Took pre-assessment, studied answers as always,  then scheduled OA same day. Passed first try. Took one day.\\n\\nC216 – MBA Capstone – **Final  Class, Tons of Work, But Fun, 1 Business Simulation + 3 Tasks (1  PowerPoint presentation + video, 1 monstrous paper and 1 easy last task  of resume, short summary of competencies learned and a linkedin profile)**.  This is the crown jewel of the program. This is the new “Marketplace”  conscious capitalism capstone business simulation that WGU switched to  on March 1st. This class has substantial work, but it is all relevant  and doable. I spent the better part of 7 days taking my time on the  capstone. Maybe some people can finish faster, but of all the classes in  the program, this is the one I wanted to “get” and understand. You  start off with the business simulation. The simulation consists of 6  “quarters” you have to work through. You stop after quarter 4 and do a  PowerPoint presentation, along with a video in panopto about your work  and decisions from quarters 1-4. In this PowerPoint presentation, you  follow the rubric and create a plan to “pitch” a proposal to venture  capitalists for additional funding for your business. The sim already  gives you the money at the end of quarter 4, but you are not able to  move forward to “use” it until you get to quarters 5 and 6 in the game.  And for that, you have to pass task 1. So once you successfully pitch  your proposal to the venture capitalists (ie, the graders/evaluators)  and they feel your proposal PowerPoint and video was sufficient to pass,  you then get to move on to quarters 5 and 6. Next, you complete  quarters 5 and 6 in the business sim, then comes the **monstrosity**  that is task 2. For task 2, you will follow the rubric and write about  15-18 pages explaining all your decisions in the simulation, and why you  chose to invest in certain things, all while keeping in line with the  sim’s guidelines. (Environmental handling, Employee satisfaction etc.)  Again, this paper is the quote on quote “final” large paper of the  program, and it is a killer. You will have to save charts and  information from the simulation to copy and enter into your paper for  task 2. The simulation lets you easily save the data and export it to  Excel. From there, you just copy and paste it in your paper. All in,  it’s fun once you get into it. Its like a cheesy, old pc role playing  game. But with shit graphics and a bunch of numbers and reading. Took me  a whole day alone just to prepare the data and the charts and write  task 2. Finally, once you finish that monstrosity of a paper for task 2  and pass, you are essentially home free and done with all the hard work  in the program, and you can move on to task 3. For task 3, you just  write a short summary of 3 competencies you used in the program from  previous classes that helped you successfully complete the business sim,  then you create a S.M.A.R.T. goal (google SMART goals, its easy, don’t  worry) and explain how you plan to achieve it in the future. Then you  discuss 3 artifacts (an artifact is any type of credential, degree,  certification, association membership etc., that you have) that tie into  the three competencies discussed earlier and how it will help you  succeed in the future, or how it has helped you succeed in the past.  Then, when you finish that, you touch up your resume. Make sure you add  WGU as the latest school with the degree end month and year, which is  about the same time you are doing this, of course. Then go to linkedin,  create a profile, or touch up your existing profile if you already have  one, and follow the instructions in the rubric, which is super easy.  Then save the profile as a pdf. Again, all this is super easy. Then  submit it all: the task 3 paper, the Resume, the Linkedin profile as a  pdf, and the 3 artifacts you talked about in your task 3 summary. Use  whatever 3 artifacts you have. For example, I used my Bachelors degree  as one artifact, and membership in a professional organization as  another artifact. Use whatever you got. Save them as a pdf and submit it  all. Took me about 7 days with breaks for this class, but it was fun  when all said and done. Once submitted, sit back, know you worked your  ass off, and wait to see the good news. You did it. You got your MBA.  Your program mentor will call you soon. They will put you in for  graduation. Takes about 2-3 days to go through and process your degree.  Thank God. Kiss your spouse. Celebrate with some ice cream. Pet your  dog. You are all done. Let it sink in. You deserve it. You did good.

       "      <td>Ideas for Alternate Course Order?\\nI started November 1st.  A recent post inspired me to look at the courses I have and really think about it.  I'm currently enrolled and studying D315 - Networking Foundations.  It's very dry so far, but it was one of the first classes of my \"semester\".  I had just finished **Intro to IT** last week.  Anyway, here are the classes that I have left in the order that she put them in, she being my counselor:  \\n\\n\\nNetwork and Security - Foundations – D315 **(currently enrolled)**  \\nWeb Development Foundations – D276  \\nData Management - Foundations – D426  \\n\\-&gt; (next semester)  \\nHardware and Operating Systems Essentials – D386  \\nData Management - Applications – D427  \\nVersion Control – D197  \\nCloud Foundations – D282  \\nScripting and Programming - Foundations – D278  \\n\\-&gt; (next semester)  \\nBusiness of IT - Project Management – D324  \\nIntroduction to Programming in Python – D335  \\nBusiness of IT – Applications – D336  \\nData Structures and Algorithms I – C949  \\n\\-&gt; (next semester)  \\nIT Leadership Foundations – D370  \\nFront-End Web Development – D277  \\nJavaScript Programming – D280  \\nSoftware Engineering – D284  \\n\\-&gt; (next semester)  \\nJava Fundamentals – D286  \\nJava Frameworks – D287  \\nUser Interface Design – D279  \\nUser Experience Design – D479  \\n\\-&gt; (next semester)  \\nBack-End Programming – D288  \\nAdvanced Java – D387  \\nSoftware Design and Quality Assurance – D480  \\nAdvanced Data Management – D326  \\n\\-&gt; (Final semester)  \\nSoftware Security and Testing – D385  \\nMobile Application Development (Android) – D308  \\nSoftware Engineering Capstone – D424  \\n\\n\\nNow, I have **NO** intention of doing THIS many semesters at all.  I want to finish as soon as I can.  I want to aim for a year, a year and a half tops, two if I'm super sluggish.  I operate better with a gameplan and I'm mostly new to this material outside of some online tutorials for Java.  Which classes do you guys recommend taking first and in what order should I take these?    \\n\\n\\nNote about D315: Network foundations is boring, but it's a lot of memorization.  That study guide I got from you guys is great.  The videos seem alright too and the stuff the teacher provides is fine.  I just need more time before I feel comfortable taking the pre-assessment.</td>\n",

I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database &amp; SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&amp;list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching &amp; promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope &amp; out-of-scope), requirements (functional &amp; non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development &amp; testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cloud Computing Azure Track - DONE!\\n  \\n\\nI finished my degree in the final month of my second term. I got the pass notification for the final part of my capstone this morning. I don’t see many people posting about the Cloud Computing Azure Track, so I wanted to post my experiences with the degree program to help those still working on it. It took a lot of hard work and sacrifice, but I managed to complete my goal of finishing in one year. My job and toddler didn’t make it easy!\\n\\nI chose the Cloud Computing degree because I wanted something a bit more specialized than the IT degree and had no interest in cybersecurity as my local job market is flooded with cyber grads due to a local community college offering a bachelor's degree in cyber. I chose cloud over networking purely out of personal interest. I do plan on seeking out my CCNA to round out my skills for future job searches.\\n\\nI currently work full time in IT in the public sector, but my job is in desktop support. My hope is that by completing my degree, I’ll be able to land a job at the system/network/cloud administrator level. I’ve just started my job search.\\n\\nI transferred in the following classes. It was a mix of previously held certifications and Sophia/SDC. It totaled 37 CUs.\\n\\nIT Applications – D317\\n\\nIT Foundations – D316\\n\\nNetwork and Security - Foundations – D315\\n\\nNetworks – D325\\n\\nIntroduction to IT – D322\\n\\nIntroduction to Physical and Human Geography – D199\\n\\nWeb Development Foundations – D276\\n\\nApplied Algebra – C957\\n\\nApplied Probability and Statistics – C955\\n\\nAmerican Politics and the US Constitution – C963\\n\\nIntroduction to Communication: Connecting with Others – D268\\n\\nI managed to complete 48 CUs in my first term that started last June.\\n\\nIntegrated Physical Sciences – C165   06/02/22\\n\\nI remember very little about this class. I think I knew most of it already and just used a quizlet I found on this subreddit to brush up.\\n\\nIntroduction to Biology – C190  06/04/22\\n\\nThis subreddit led me to the Amoeba Sisters, and their playlist was enough to pass this. I watched the whole thing and then smashed the OA.\\n\\nComposition: Writing with a Strategy – D269 06/12/22\\n\\nI’m a pretty good writer. I found this class to be pretty easy. Grading seems to be strictly on the rubric. Write to it. I used a template from my CI for every class that had a non-coding PA and never even had to look at the rubric. Got an excellence award for task 4.\\n\\nNetwork and Security - Applications – D329  07/15/22\\n\\nI spent a month on Security+, but I didn’t really need to. I fucked off a lot in that time. Could have definitely finished it faster. I only used CBTNuggets to study. Also used Certmaster for just the practice tests and a few of the PBQs.\\n\\nIntroduction to Cryptography – D334  07/24/22\\n\\nStudied a quizlet I found on this subreddit. Lots of memorization, but I’m good at that. Obviously lots of crossover with the last class.\\n\\nScripting and Programming - Foundations – D278  07/30/22\\n\\nPretty basic. I did the Zybooks. \\n\\nScripting and Automation – D411 08/12/22\\n\\nLoved working with Powershell. This class was fun, and I wish the degree delved deeper into Powershell. One of my favorite classes for sure.\\n\\nBusiness of IT - Project Management – D324 08/30/22\\n\\nUsed CBTNuggets and whatever practice tests I could find. Didn’t find it terribly difficult, but also not interesting.\\n\\nCloud Applications – D318 09/27/22\\n\\nAgain, I took my time with the CompTIA cert. Definitely could have taken it down quicker with more dedication. CBTNuggets, random practice tests, and Certmaster for the PBQs got me the W.\\n\\nEthics in Technology – D333 10/15/22\\n\\nQuizlet…\\n\\nAzure Fundamentals – D303 10/06/22\\n\\nSame stack as the CompTIA classes. CBTNuggets, random practice tests, and selective use of Certmaster.\\n\\nData Management - Foundations – D426 10/28/22\\n\\nMy first experience with SQL. I enjoyed the class. Spent about two weeks on it. Did the Zybooks.\\n\\nTechnical Communication – D339 10/31/22\\n\\nWrite to the template provided by the CI. Not much to it. Grades came back quick!\\n\\nIT Leadership Foundations – D370 11/20/22\\n\\nSame as above. Got another excellence award for task 1. I can’t state enough how little effort is really required for the writing classes. I was very surprised to get either excellence award.\\n\\nBusiness of IT – Applications – D336 11/30/22\\n\\nDry as hell. Had no fun with this. Just wanted to get it done as quickly as possible. Used a youtube playlist recommended on here and a quizlet.\\n\\nSecond term: Finished my remaining 36 CUs.\\n\\nInternet of Things (IoT) and Infrastructure – D337 12/09/22\\n\\nActually read the book. Ugh… It was no fun, but not particularly hard either.\\n\\nLinux Foundations – D281 01/05/23\\n\\nI had no Linux experience prior to this. I definitely spent too much time on it for as basic as the test ended up being. Watched a youtube playlist. Can’t recall the name… Something Powers. Guy does some CBTNuggets stuff too.\\n\\nCloud Platform Solutions – D338 01/19/23\\n\\nRead the book. Very dry. I might have not read the book, but the course chatter had numerous people saying that they studied for the cert using other materials and failed. They only passed after reading the book, so I bit the bullet and choked it down. Took notes and tried to pick out the things that I thought they might ask on the test. Not too bad. \\n\\nManaging Cloud Security – D320 01/21/23\\n\\nUsed a quizlet I found on here. Lots of overlapping material with previous classes. Took this one down quick.\\n\\nData Management - Applications – D427 02/05/23\\n\\nI really wish I would have done this right after the foundations class. Would have definitely made this class faster. Overall, not bad. Did the Zybooks.\\n\\nData Systems Administration – D330 02/11/23\\n\\nPerhaps my least favorite class. Read the stupid book and was glad to be done with this one quickly.\\n\\nIntroduction to Programming in Python – D335 04/15/23\\n\\nI came into this class expecting it to be a beast, and it was. Contrary to popular belief, I used the Zybooks and found it to be fine. Definitely taught most of what you need to know for the test. This was the only OA that I failed in the whole degree. Took the test on 3/29 or so and felt awesome about it, but failed. I immediately knew why. There were a couple of questions that had a seemingly useless extra space at the end of the sample output. I agonized while taking the test if I should include them. I ended up including them even when it made my code longer and more convoluted. Turns out that was the wrong fucking move. To say that I was pissed would be an understatement. I was going out of town for over a week and didn’t take the test again until after I got back. Passed that time. The second time I took it, there were none of these weird extra spaces at the end of sample output. YMMV. Still probably my favorite class. I really had a great time learning python. Will 100% keep working on Python in the future.\\n\\nAlso, I had to take a piss for about 40 minutes. The damn proctor would just not respond to any of my yelling or waving my arms about. I guess they fell asleep or ran off or something. Beyond frustrating. \\n\\nAzure Developer Associate – D306 04/21/23\\n\\nI didn’t have time to watch a whole 30 hour CBTNuggets course for this. I ended up reading the damn book again and passing by a decent margin. Definitely do not feel ready for the actual cert.\\n\\nAzure DevOps Solutions – D304 04/29/23\\n\\nNo book for this class. Just links to Microsoft Learn and a few random Pluralsight videos. I didn’t actually watch many of the videos, but I did dutifully go through every damn MSLearn module. Occasionally links in the course material were broken. I’m assuming that MS killed those pages. It’s real fucking lame that they don’t keep those updated. If there’s material on those broken links on the OA, that’s pretty fucked. It was enough to pass, but I only took down the OA by the skin of my fucking teeth. One more wrong answer would have sunk me. PA lined up pretty good with the OA.\\n\\nAzure Data Engineer – D305 05/12/23\\n\\nSame as above. Did the MSLearn stuff in the course material and YOLOed the OA. Once again passed by the skin of my fucking teeth. I found the OA to be way tougher than the PA here. Should have definitely studied more for this one and the last. A few broken links here as well.\\n\\nCloud Computing Capstone – D342 05/18/23\\n\\nI picked a pretty basic topic for this one to ensure I could get that sweet, sweet confetti. Basic database cloud migration. The CI gave me a great template to use. Wrote the bulk of both papers over three days. Don’t overthink this.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the process of getting the degree. It was tough, but I feel great now that it’s over. In hindsight, I would probably have enjoyed CS more as the Powershell and Python classes were my favorite. I definitely have the itch to improve my programming skills. Very interested in pursuing a masters in CS after a long needed break to hang out with daddy’s special princess #1.\\n\\nI’m heading out of town today to see a show, but I’ll respond when I have the time if anyone has any questions.

A recent post inspired me to look at the courses I have and really think about it.  I'm currently enrolled and studying D315 - Networking Foundations.  It's very dry so far, but it was one of the first classes of my \"semester\".  I had just finished **Intro to IT** last week.  Anyway, here are the classes that I have left in the order that she put them in, she being my counselor:  \\n\\n\\nNetwork and Security - Foundations – D315 **(currently enrolled)**  \\nWeb Development Foundations – D276  \\nData Management - Foundations – D426  \\n\\-> (next semester)  \\nHardware and Operating Systems Essentials – D386  \\nData Management - Applications – D427  \\nVersion Control – D197  \\nCloud Foundations – D282  \\nScripting and Programming - Foundations – D278  \\n\\-> (next semester)  \\nBusiness of IT - Project Management – D324  \\nIntroduction to Programming in Python – D335  \\nBusiness of IT – Applications – D336  \\nData Structures and Algorithms I – C949  \\n\\-> (next semester)  \\nIT Leadership Foundations – D370  \\nFront-End Web Development – D277  \\nJavaScript Programming – D280  \\nSoftware Engineering – D284  \\n\\-> (next semester)  \\nJava Fundamentals – D286  \\nJava Frameworks – D287  \\nUser Interface Design – D279  \\nUser Experience Design – D479  \\n\\-> (next semester)  \\nBack-End Programming – D288  \\nAdvanced Java – D387  \\nSoftware Design and Quality Assurance – D480  \\nAdvanced Data Management – D326  \\n\\-> (Final semester)  \\nSoftware Security and Testing – D385  \\nMobile Application Development (Android) – D308  \\nSoftware Engineering Capstone – D424  \\n\\n\\nNow, I have **NO** intention of doing THIS many semesters at all.  I want to finish as soon as I can.  I want to aim for a year, a year and a half tops, two if I'm super sluggish.  I operate better with a gameplan and I'm mostly new to this material outside of some online tutorials for Java.  Which classes do you guys recommend taking first and in what order should I take these?    \\n\\n\\nNote about D315: Network foundations is boring, but it's a lot of memorization.  That study guide I got from you guys is great.  The videos seem alright too and the stuff the teacher provides is fine.  I just need more time before I feel comfortable taking the pre-assessment.  \n",

Transferred Before Starting WGU BSCS on June 1st. Looking for Tips!\\nHey everyone! 👋\\n\\nI’m finishing my diploma evaluation (I graduated high school outside the U.S.), and if everything goes smoothly, I’ll be starting **WGU’s BSCS program** on June 1st. 🙌\\n\\nIn the meantime, I transferred 19 courses from [Study.com](http://Study.com) and Sophia Learning to get a head start and save time and tuition.\\n\\n⸻\\n\\n📚 [Study.com](http://Study.com) (16 classes completed)\\n\\n1. C963 – American Politics and the US Constitution → Political Science 102\\n2. D278 – Scripting and Programming - Foundations → Computer Science 109\\n3. C949 – Data Structures and Algorithms I → Computer Science 201\\n4. C683 – Natural Science Lab → Biology 101L\\n5. C955 – Applied Probability and Statistics → Statistics 101\\n6. D270 – Composition: Successful Self-Expression → English 104\\n7. D268 – Introduction to Communication → Communications 101\\n8. D284 – Software Engineering → Computer Science 307\\n9. D427 – Data Management – Applications → Computer Science 204\\n10. D430 – Fundamentals of Information Security → Computer Science 110\\n11. D429 – Introduction to AI for Computer Scientists → Computer Science 311\\n12. C952 – Computer Architecture → Computer Science 306\\n13. C959 – Discrete Mathematics I → Math 108\\n14. C458 – Health, Fitness, and Wellness → Health 101\\n15. D426 – Data Management – Foundations → Computer Science 107\\n16. D315 – Network and Security – Foundations → Computer Science 108\\n\\n⸻\\n\\n📘 Sophia Learning (3 classes completed)\\n\\n1. D276 – Web Development Foundations → CS1005\\n2. C958 – Calculus I → MATH1040\\n3. D286 – Java Fundamentals → CS1101\\n\\n⸻\\n\\n🔧 Optional: Oracle Exam Route?\\n\\nWhile I still have a bit of time before May 1, I’m debating whether to take Oracle certification exams for the following WGU courses:\\n\\n* C867 – Scripting and Programming – Applications → Oracle Associate Java SE 8 (1Z0-808)\\n* D287 – Java Frameworks → Oracle Professional Java SE 8 (1Z0-809)\\n* D387 – Advanced Java → Oracle Professional Java SE 8 (1Z0-809)\\n\\nBut I’ve heard WGU’s internal versions of these courses are easier and more flexible than passing official Oracle exams. Has anyone here done both paths and can share which route worked best for them?\\n\\n⸻\\n\\n🧠 Planning My Remaining Courses\\n\\nHere’s what I still have left to complete at WGU:\\n\\n* D333 – Ethics in Technology\\n* D459 – Introduction to Systems Thinking and Applications\\n* C960 – Discrete Mathematics II\\n* D336 – Business of IT – Applications\\n* D684 – Introduction to Computer Science\\n* D686 – Operating Systems for Computer Scientists\\n* D480 – Software Design and Quality Assurance\\n* D288 – Back-End Programming\\n* D685 – Practical Applications of Prompt\\n* D197 – Version Control\\n* C950 – Data Structures and Algorithms II\\n* D682 – AI Optimization for CS\\n* D683 – Advanced AI and Machine Learning\\n* D687 – CS Project Development with a Team\\n\\nSince I’m working full-time, I’d love to hear:\\n\\n1. How did you organize or schedule these courses?\\n2. Which of them were OA vs PA, and how did that affect your workflow?\\n3. Any resources, YouTube channels, Discords, tools, or planning methods that helped you stay on track?\\n4. Which ones were easier to knock out early, and which ones required more time or technical focus?\\n\\nWould love to hear your experience or advice on planning the journey ahead! 🙏  \n",

BSSWE degree with a goal of 1.5-2 years. Transferred in 50 credits. What order do you recommend I take my classes? I heard that some classes build on top of each other.

       "4  BSSWE Java Track Monster Guide and Review\\nI finally graduated! After 3 terms, working full time at my job and as a father. I wanted to give back to the Reddit community, which I used extensively for advice throughout this journey. So, I created a *very* long list of every course with some brief guidance and review.\\n\\n* WGU attracts both professionals already working in the field, as well as newcomers to the field. To give some context of who I am:\\n   * I transferred in 13 of the 119 CU's required for this degree's completion.\\n   * 6 year active duty military veteran, worked in aviation before transitioning to IT once I separated from the military.\\n   * Worked one year as a Linux Administrator before beginning this degree.\\n   * Earned Security+, CCNA, RHCSA, and RHCE before beginning this degree.\\n   * I chose this degree because I wanted my career to move in the \"DevOps\" direction. I felt I was reasonably adaquete with the \"Ops\" side, but wanted to strengthen the \"Dev\" side. I feel that this degree helped me land my current role as a DevOps Engineer.\\n\\nThe order of this course list is the preferred order of completion (according to WGU), and comes from [here (PDF)](https://www.wgu.edu/content/dam/wgu-65-assets/western-governors/documents/program-guides/information-technology/BSSWE_Java.pdf)\\n\\n***This is my personal experience and opinion*** if you have things to add or disagree with anything, leave it in the comments, or make your own guide.\\n\\nAs many of you know, Reddit should be one of the first (if not the first) place to go to get advice on a certain course. You can add Reddit to \"Resources Used\" for every class below.\\n\\n* **D278: Scripting and Programming - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad, I've taken some online coding classes before, and this is pretty much that. What's important here is knowing how to read code, and understanding what the code will produce once ran. Stuff like data types, order of operations, and basic algorithms.\\n\\n* **D335: Introduction to Programming in Python**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** A challenge, I knew *a little* Python coming in. I overall enjoyed this one and thought it was pretty useful to get me thinking like a programmer. Useful because Python is pretty big in my specific line of work. A lot of folks complain about the Zybooks and the grading for the OA, but once I got used to it I didn't have any problems.\\n\\n* **D370: IT Leadership Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to do a Clifton Strengths test, a paper on my results and what they mean, and a 2nd paper on an analysis of a video meeting between colleagues. I Needed to really pay attention to the meeting and justify decisions to handle conflicts that happen.\\n\\n* **D276: Web Development Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE)\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to be able to read and understand what html + css will display in the browser. I became pretty familiar with a lot of the html elements and css selectors and properties. Also needed to understand the components of developer tools and how to properly inspect a web page in the browser.\\n\\n* **D370: Version Control**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I already knew some basic git coming into this (create, checkout, merge, commit, pull, push, etc), so this was good practice. I did this on a Linux VM, because that's what I'm used to, so didn't have to deal with git-bash. Completed this course pretty fast.\\n\\n* **D277: Front-End Web Development**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UB1O30fR-EE), Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This one built upon D276, and I put into practice what I learned. If I knew what I know now, I'd take this immediately after. This is also where I discovered I despise designing/styling web pages haha, html + css is very tedious to work with for me (skill issue). Needed to create page layouts for my site, and actually make a website. I used InfityFree to host it.\\n\\n* **C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 1/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** None\\n   * **Notes:** It might be just how my brain works, but this class was very easy for me. Took the practice OA immediately, passed it, then passed the OA within 24 hours. Just had to review some of the charts a little.\\n\\n* **D322: Introduction to IT**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 2/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** By the time I took this class, I'd been working in IT for a little over a year. This experience, plus certifications that I took before starting this degree helped a ton here. I took the PA immediately, passed it, and just brushed up on domains that I wasn't strong with using Course Materials and Google.\\n\\n* **C683: Natural Science Lab**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 3/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Published papers on my chosen topic\\n   * **Notes:** The hardest part for me was brainstorming an original idea to do my experiment on. I happened to have a pH testing kit in the house, so thought about using that somehow. I finally settled on comparing the pH of distilled water vs hard well water (my landlord at the time refused to buy us a water softener...) after periods of time while boiling. Needed to write a paper on the standard scientific process (hypothesis, controls, etc) and my findings.\\n\\n* **C957: Applied Algebra**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **C957: Data Structures and Algorithms**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Google Research, Youtube, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** You'll see this all over Reddit, that if there's one class to take your time on, it's this one. I agree. I learned a ton from this one, because this was all new material to me. The Zybooks material was TOUGH, and it was difficult for me to stay focused through it, because it can get dry. All I did was power through the Zybooks and research topics that weren't sticking and that was enough to pass.\\n\\n* **D372: Introduction to Systems Thinking**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Needed to write 3 papers, analyze a business using the Iceberg model, a case study using an archetype (from a list provided), and a final case study using the \"Four Steps Tool\". Not much to this, just learn what each of these Analysis tools are, and see how they apply to the business/case studies.\\n\\n* **D426: Data Management - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Instructor Cohort, Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I came into this with a minimal amount of relational database & SQL knowledge. The Zybooks was mostly all that I used, with supplemental Google and Youtube to help. I also attended an instructor cohort, because I was having real trouble understanding the different types of joins. It was the only instructor interaction I had the whole degree, but it was definitely worth it! Like C957, the Zybooks material can get pretty dry, I just powered through.\\n\\n* **D427: Data Management - Applications**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources sed:** Zybooks Labs, [SQL Bolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)\\n   * **Notes:** I took this immediately after D426, and I recommend you do the same. I went through SQL Bolt lessons a couple of times (*highly recommed them*) and the Zybooks Labs and PA too. The benefit to doing this right after D426 is it's all still fresh in your mind. This one was pretty fun for me.\\n\\n* **D280: JavaScript Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks, Youtube, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Holy cow, this one had me so confused. I naively thought it'd be like D335 (Python one) when I grabbed this course, but it was nothing at all like that. I read on Reddit that some think this course should be named \"Angular Hell\". What got me through was a Youtube tutorial I stumbled across of a person who made an interactive SVG with API calls, not completely the same as this course, but how to do API calls and use an SVG knowledge was huge. Hang in there on this one, and like all courses, use Reddit posts for help.\\n\\n* **D333: Ethics in Technology**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash cards\\n   * **Notes:** A bit more difficult than expected, but not horrible at all. Needed to understand ethical theories, what an ethical decision would be, and laws. Some cyber security terms thrown in as well.\\n\\n* **D315: Network and Security - Foundations**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from either the CCNA or Security+ certification. I don't remember which.\\n\\n* **D326: Advanced Data Management**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, D427 + D426 course material\\n   * **Notes:** Ideally, I feel this one should be done after D426 and D427, but I waited almost a whole year after completing those before starting this one. So, I had to relearn a lot of SQL. Very similar to D427, but there are some added requirements like triggers thrown in. I was solving a business need with SQL this time. The provided lab environment where I completed the majority of this work takes a little bit to get used to, and I struggled a bit to brainstorm a specific business need to solve, but overall I really enjoyed this class.\\n\\n* **D279: User Interface Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one I thought was pretty straight-forward. There are two parts. The first part I wrote a paper where I analyzed an existing UI, described what should be improved, and created a sitemap and a wireframe. The second part I created an interactive prototype of the new UI (I did it in PowerPoint).\\n\\n* **D479: User Experience Design**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** I admittedly went above and beyond for this one. If I did it an easier way, it'd probably be a 6/10 in difficulty. There's quite a lot that goes into this one, and about 80% of it is in Task 1. In Task 1, I created a PowerPoint with a timeline for developing my UI, a persona profile for my target audience, Wireframes, a flowchart, and a guerilla testing plan. Also needed to create an actual prototype of the UI. The prototype is where I went above and beyond, because I decided to teach myself React framework (Why??). I hosted it with Netlify, and it was free. For task two, I created Panopto videos reviewing other student submissions and went on little scavenger hunts to find all of the information their site has to offer. This is like a peer review, and I needed to make a write up of what advice from other students I'd implement in my prototype when my own UI was reviewed. I'd recommend for your prototype, to access other student's prototypes in task 2 before making your own, to give you some ideas. I saw stuff made with drag and drop websites like Wix, as well as some Powerpoints (easiest).\\n\\n* **D286: Java Fundamentals**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Zybooks - All recommended lessons. Did all labs and PA at least twice each\\n   * **Notes:** This one is exactly like D335 (the Python one). Java is a lot more verbose and has certain syntax that takes a bit to get used to. I enjoyed this one and the little puzzles in the labs and practice OA were rewarding. Just like the Python course.\\n\\n* **C458: Health, Fitness, and Wellness**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from the military.\\n\\n* **D287: Java Frameworks**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** Pretty tough class with Java Spring Framework and IntelliJ. Needed to create a GitLab repo and finish a partially built backend. There are a bunch of requirements listed in the task, but again, lean on Reddit for this one to find good resources to learn Spring, and what exactly you need to do to pass.\\n\\n* **D282: Cloud Foundations (AWS CCP)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Neal Davis and Stephane Maarek Udemy courses and practice tests, Flash cards, and Youtube practice tests I found.\\n   * **Notes:** AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Overall, I think AWS makes good certifications, and this is the entry level one. It's kind of a big vocab test, with a bit of \"Which AWS service would you use to solve this problem?\" sprinkled in.\\n\\n* **D386: Hardware and Operating Systems Essentials**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Jason Dion A+ course and practice test on Udemy\\n   * **Notes:** Again, my 1 year of IT experience and past industry certifications helped me with this one. Reviewed the domains of the OA, took the practice OA, and brushed up on my weak areas w/ sections of Jason Dion's A+ course.\\n\\n* **D324: Business of IT - Project Management (CompTIA Project+)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Pluralsight Project+ practice exams, \"Pocket Prep\" mobile app\\n   * **Notes:** CompTIA Project+ certification. If you didn't know, your WGU tuition includes a bunch of [learning subscriptions](https://www.wgu.edu/alumni/alumni-support/resources/learning-resources.html), including Pluralsight, Udemy, ACloudGuru (owned by Pluralsight) and LinkedIn Learning, which is pretty awesome. There's some solid question banks on Pluralsight that helped me out quite a bit. The \"Pocket Prep\" app is not free, but I used it to supplement my other learning. This is certainly not necessary though. With all of that being said, Project+ was awful for me... I say this because it just feels like all of the content I was studying for was just a big word salad. I've joked with my scrum master about it at work, and he agrees, a lot of the Agile terminology just feels made up haha (sorry aspiring PMs). Hopefully the last project management and CompTIA exam I need to take in my career. Wasn't exceedingly difficult, just not fun.\\n\\n* **D288: Back-End Programming**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Various Udemy and Youtube tutorials, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** Very close to D287 Java Frameworks, except I was building the backend from scratch. Definitely recommend taking D287 first to get your feet wet. once again, lean on Reddit here.\\n\\n* **D270: Composition: Successful Self-Expression**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** Three different papers here. I feel I'm a decent writer, but I'd still recommend running things through Grammarly or another tool to clean up the grammar. The first paper is a professional email, the second is a paper on how to conduct good research (sources, search engine terms, etc), and the last paper is a business proposal with recommended solutions for a problem that I made up. I did monolithic vs microservice application architecture, and why microservices can solve certain problems for example.\\n\\n* **D336: Business of IT - Applications (Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 5/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** [This Youtube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\\n   * **Notes:** Axelos ITIL 4 Foundation certification. This was the very first course I completed when I started my degree, so my memory is a little fuzzy. It's pretty comparable to studying for the CompTIA Project+, both in content and in level of pain induced. Very dry material, falling asleep, but gotta get it done. The one thing that is ingrained in my mind from this is \"IT exists to bring value to stakeholders\". I feel that I overprepared for this exam, only need a 26/40 to pass if I remember correctly.\\n\\n* **D199: Introduction to Physical and Human Geography**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** N/A\\n   * **Resources Used:** N/A\\n   * **Notes:** I transferred this one in from my semester 7 years prior in community college.\\n\\n* **D387: Advanced Java**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 7/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** Another Spring Framework and IntelliJ class. This one is in the same family as D287 Java Frameworks and D288 Back-End Programming. Needed to complete a partially built Java backend by adding certain functionality like multi-threading. I also spent some time in the already complete Angular UI's code to make my new functionality render. After completing the tasks required, I needed to containerize the frontend and backend into one container with Docker (Desktop/Engine). I use and make containers all of the time at my job, so this wasn't too bad because it was on the simpler side as far as Dockerfiles go.\\n\\n* **D385: Software Security and Testing**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 6/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** practice OA, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** The OA for this class is a hybrid of multiple choice questions and code writing questions (Python). The key for this is understanding best practices for secure code. These best practices include knowing vulnerabilities like XSS, MiTM, Injections, and DoS, how to write good try except statements, string encryption, access control, CORS, HTTP codes, stuff like that. I drilled the practice OA 4 times, and the first time I used Google to help me answer each question. After each try, I reviewed the questions and answers, understanding why the right answer was right and the wrong answers were wrong. The coding questions I drilled multiple times until they were muscle memory. That was enough to pass. I remember feeling overwhelmed when I started this course, because it is a bit advanced.\\n\\n* **D339: Technical Communication**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** I liked this one. I needed to write a blog post on a certain technology/tool, and create a PowerPoint presentation with a Panopto video narration on that same technology/tool. I presented it in a teaching & promoting tone. I chose a tool that I know quite well - Ansible. It does not need to be about something you already know well, it could be about something you want to research and learn more about too.\\n\\n* **D480: Software Design and Quality Assurance**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly\\n   * **Notes:** I had a really hard time with this one, because it's really abstract. It was two papers that I needed to write. The first paper was a software design plan involving a business case, action items (in-scope & out-of-scope), requirements (functional & non-functional), software design including the software's intended behavior and structure, and a development approach which included the deliverables and their sequence, as well as the environment I'd use in writing the application. The second paper is a QA test plan, where I summarized my software design, objectives, and key metrics I'd use to see if I hit my objectives. I wrote more about in-scope and out-of-scope functionality for the app, and finished it with a test plan and order of operations for testing, and the personnel responsible for each phase of testing. Again, it is very abstract. You're not going to be writing any code, you just need to explain the steps needed to take software from an idea to production.\\n\\n* **C963: American Politics and the US Constitution**\\n   * **OA/PA:** OA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 4/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Flash Cards\\n   * **Notes:** Not bad at all, remember key court cases, acts, and all of the amendments to the Constitution. Have a good grasp on the history of the US Government.\\n\\n* **D284: Software Engineering**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 8/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research, Grammarly, Lucid Chart\\n   * **Notes:** This one, as well as D480 Software Design and Quality Assurance are the two most difficult writing classes in my opinion. I wrote 17 pages for this one. This paper required me to make up a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) and write a proposal to a potential buyer of my CRM. This proposal required me to go in-depth about how my CRM works, from a user facing and an administrative point of view. Stay on topic with the template that is provided, and be sure to hit each objective in the rubric, because there are a lot of them.\\n\\n* **D308: Mobile Application Development (Android)**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 9/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Course Material, Google Research\\n   * **Notes:** This course required me to build an Android mobile application from scratch. I followed a video series by one of the instructors found in the \"Course Search\". I'd say this is required unless you've built an Android app before. I followed this video series almost exactly, being sure to not just copy and paste what the instructor is doing. There are a ton of steps in building this app, and a lot of going back to troubleshoot why the instructor's code works but mine doesn't. I installed Android Studio for this and an Android Emulator which took some troubleshooting to even get running on my laptop. The emulator is very resource intensive as well. In my opinion, this one should be 4 CU's not 3, because of vast quantity of code that I wrote.\\n\\n* **D424: Software Engineering Capstone**\\n   * **OA/PA:** PA\\n   * **Difficulty:** 10/10\\n   * **Resources Used:** Google Research, Youtube\\n   * **Notes:** For my capstone I decided to go above and beyond again because I wanted something that I was proud of to put in my personal GitHub repository, and I had about 90 days until the end of my final term. The Capstone is 4 tasks - 2 papers, application development & testing, and automated cloud deployment. Alot of people on Reddit recommend to use one of the previous apps you've made in this degree and add a few things to it, such as a searchbar and unit tests to make it pass. This is perfectly fine, and if I went this route, it'd probably be an 8/10 in difficulty. I chose to make a web application with a bunch of tools/frameworks; An Angular/Nginx frontend container, a Flask backend container, a MariaDB database container, and Redis and ElasticSearch containers for supporting functionality. I deployed it to AWS ECS Fargate with Terraform. It used JWT tokens for auth, had RBAC functionality, and a really good search bar. I'm glad I put in the extra effort to make something from scratch, because I have something I'm proud of to put on my resume and I learned a ton.  \n",

Course order/sequence\\nThis is my best guess for the best/most logical sequence to take the cs classes (excluding geneds). This is after read some posts about groupings of classes that have overlap and a post I read that kinda talked about sequence also reviewing some of the course descriptions. So this is me trying to piece it all together.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Web Development Foundations – C779 \\n* IT Leadership Foundations – D370 \\n* Business of IT – Applications – D336 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Introduction to IT – C182 \\n* Ethics in Technology – D333 \\n* Fundamentals of Information Security – D430 \\n* Network and Security - Foundations – D315 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Data Management - Foundations – C175 \\n* Data Management - Applications – D427 \\n* Advanced Data Management – D326 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Scripting and Programming - Foundations – D278 \\n* Software Design and Quality Assurance – D480 \\n* Scripting and Programming - Applications – C867 \\n* Discrete Mathematics I – C959\\n* Data Structures and Algorithms I – C949 \\n* Discrete Mathematics II – C960 \\n* Data Structures and Algorithms II – C950\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Java Fundamentals – D286 \\n* Version Control – D197 \\n* Java Frameworks – D287 \\n* Back-End Programming – D288 \\n* Advanced Java – D387  \\n* Software Engineering – D284 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* Linux Foundations – D281 \\n* Computer Architecture – C952 \\n* Operating Systems for Programmers – C191 \\n* Introduction to Artificial Intelligence – C951 \\n* Technical Communication – D339 \\n* Computer Science Capstone – C964 \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAny alumni able to provide feedback?  \n",



                                                                                                                                                 Cloud Computing Azure Track - DONE!\\n  \\n\\nI finished my degree in the final month of my second term. I got the pass notification for the final part of my capstone this morning. I don’t see many people posting about the Cloud Computing Azure Track, so I wanted to post my experiences with the degree program to help those still working on it. It took a lot of hard work and sacrifice, but I managed to complete my goal of finishing in one year. My job and toddler didn’t make it easy!\\n\\nI chose the Cloud Computing degree because I wanted something a bit more specialized than the IT degree and had no interest in cybersecurity as my local job market is flooded with cyber grads due to a local community college offering a bachelor's degree in cyber. I chose cloud over networking purely out of personal interest. I do plan on seeking out my CCNA to round out my skills for future job searches.\\n\\nI currently work full time in IT in the public sector, but my job is in desktop support. My hope is that by completing my degree, I’ll be able to land a job at the system/network/cloud administrator level. I’ve just started my job search.\\n\\nI transferred in the following classes. It was a mix of previously held certifications and Sophia/SDC. It totaled 37 CUs.\\n\\nIT Applications – D317\\n\\nIT Foundations – D316\\n\\nNetwork and Security - Foundations – D315\\n\\nNetworks – D325\\n\\nIntroduction to IT – D322\\n\\nIntroduction to Physical and Human Geography – D199\\n\\nWeb Development Foundations – D276\\n\\nApplied Algebra – C957\\n\\nApplied Probability and Statistics – C955\\n\\nAmerican Politics and the US Constitution – C963\\n\\nIntroduction to Communication: Connecting with Others – D268\\n\\nI managed to complete 48 CUs in my first term that started last June.\\n\\nIntegrated Physical Sciences – C165   06/02/22\\n\\nI remember very little about this class. I think I knew most of it already and just used a quizlet I found on this subreddit to brush up.\\n\\nIntroduction to Biology – C190  06/04/22\\n\\nThis subreddit led me to the Amoeba Sisters, and their playlist was enough to pass this. I watched the whole thing and then smashed the OA.\\n\\nComposition: Writing with a Strategy – D269 06/12/22\\n\\nI’m a pretty good writer. I found this class to be pretty easy. Grading seems to be strictly on the rubric. Write to it. I used a template from my CI for every class that had a non-coding PA and never even had to look at the rubric. Got an excellence award for task 4.\\n\\nNetwork and Security - Applications – D329  07/15/22\\n\\nI spent a month on Security+, but I didn’t really need to. I fucked off a lot in that time. Could have definitely finished it faster. I only used CBTNuggets to study. Also used Certmaster for just the practice tests and a few of the PBQs.\\n\\nIntroduction to Cryptography – D334  07/24/22\\n\\nStudied a quizlet I found on this subreddit. Lots of memorization, but I’m good at that. Obviously lots of crossover with the last class.\\n\\nScripting and Programming - Foundations – D278  07/30/22\\n\\nPretty basic. I did the Zybooks. \\n\\nScripting and Automation – D411 08/12/22\\n\\nLoved working with Powershell. This class was fun, and I wish the degree delved deeper into Powershell. One of my favorite classes for sure.\\n\\nBusiness of IT - Project Management – D324 08/30/22\\n\\nUsed CBTNuggets and whatever practice tests I could find. Didn’t find it terribly difficult, but also not interesting.\\n\\nCloud Applications – D318 09/27/22\\n\\nAgain, I took my time with the CompTIA cert. Definitely could have taken it down quicker with more dedication. CBTNuggets, random practice tests, and Certmaster for the PBQs got me the W.\\n\\nEthics in Technology – D333 10/15/22\\n\\nQuizlet…\\n\\nAzure Fundamentals – D303 10/06/22\\n\\nSame stack as the CompTIA classes. CBTNuggets, random practice tests, and selective use of Certmaster.\\n\\nData Management - Foundations – D426 10/28/22\\n\\nMy first experience with SQL. I enjoyed the class. Spent about two weeks on it. Did the Zybooks.\\n\\nTechnical Communication – D339 10/31/22\\n\\nWrite to the template provided by the CI. Not much to it. Grades came back quick!\\n\\nIT Leadership Foundations – D370 11/20/22\\n\\nSame as above. Got another excellence award for task 1. I can’t state enough how little effort is really required for the writing classes. I was very surprised to get either excellence award.\\n\\nBusiness of IT – Applications – D336 11/30/22\\n\\nDry as hell. Had no fun with this. Just wanted to get it done as quickly as possible. Used a youtube playlist recommended on here and a quizlet.\\n\\nSecond term: Finished my remaining 36 CUs.\\n\\nInternet of Things (IoT) and Infrastructure – D337 12/09/22\\n\\nActually read the book. Ugh… It was no fun, but not particularly hard either.\\n\\nLinux Foundations – D281 01/05/23\\n\\nI had no Linux experience prior to this. I definitely spent too much time on it for as basic as the test ended up being. Watched a youtube playlist. Can’t recall the name… Something Powers. Guy does some CBTNuggets stuff too.\\n\\nCloud Platform Solutions – D338 01/19/23\\n\\nRead the book. Very dry. I might have not read the book, but the course chatter had numerous people saying that they studied for the cert using other materials and failed. They only passed after reading the book, so I bit the bullet and choked it down. Took notes and tried to pick out the things that I thought they might ask on the test. Not too bad. \\n\\nManaging Cloud Security – D320 01/21/23\\n\\nUsed a quizlet I found on here. Lots of overlapping material with previous classes. Took this one down quick.\\n\\nData Management - Applications – D427 02/05/23\\n\\nI really wish I would have done this right after the foundations class. Would have definitely made this class faster. Overall, not bad. Did the Zybooks.\\n\\nData Systems Administration – D330 02/11/23\\n\\nPerhaps my least favorite class. Read the stupid book and was glad to be done with this one quickly.\\n\\nIntroduction to Programming in Python – D335 04/15/23\\n\\nI came into this class expecting it to be a beast, and it was. Contrary to popular belief, I used the Zybooks and found it to be fine. Definitely taught most of what you need to know for the test. This was the only OA that I failed in the whole degree. Took the test on 3/29 or so and felt awesome about it, but failed. I immediately knew why. There were a couple of questions that had a seemingly useless extra space at the end of the sample output. I agonized while taking the test if I should include them. I ended up including them even when it made my code longer and more convoluted. Turns out that was the wrong fucking move. To say that I was pissed would be an understatement. I was going out of town for over a week and didn’t take the test again until after I got back. Passed that time. The second time I took it, there were none of these weird extra spaces at the end of sample output. YMMV. Still probably my favorite class. I really had a great time learning python. Will 100% keep working on Python in the future.\\n\\nAlso, I had to take a piss for about 40 minutes. The damn proctor would just not respond to any of my yelling or waving my arms about. I guess they fell asleep or ran off or something. Beyond frustrating. \\n\\nAzure Developer Associate – D306 04/21/23\\n\\nI didn’t have time to watch a whole 30 hour CBTNuggets course for this. I ended up reading the damn book again and passing by a decent margin. Definitely do not feel ready for the actual cert.\\n\\nAzure DevOps Solutions – D304 04/29/23\\n\\nNo book for this class. Just links to Microsoft Learn and a few random Pluralsight videos. I didn’t actually watch many of the videos, but I did dutifully go through every damn MSLearn module. Occasionally links in the course material were broken. I’m assuming that MS killed those pages. It’s real fucking lame that they don’t keep those updated. If there’s material on those broken links on the OA, that’s pretty fucked. It was enough to pass, but I only took down the OA by the skin of my fucking teeth. One more wrong answer would have sunk me. PA lined up pretty good with the OA.\\n\\nAzure Data Engineer – D305 05/12/23\\n\\nSame as above. Did the MSLearn stuff in the course material and YOLOed the OA. Once again passed by the skin of my fucking teeth. I found the OA to be way tougher than the PA here. Should have definitely studied more for this one and the last. A few broken links here as well.\\n\\nCloud Computing Capstone – D342 05/18/23\\n\\nI picked a pretty basic topic for this one to ensure I could get that sweet, sweet confetti. Basic database cloud migration. The CI gave me a great template to use. Wrote the bulk of both papers over three days. Don’t overthink this.\\n\\nOverall, I really enjoyed the process of getting the degree. It was tough, but I feel great now that it’s over. In hindsight, I would probably have enjoyed CS more as the Powershell and Python classes were my favorite. I definitely have the itch to improve my programming skills. Very interested in pursuing a masters in CS after a long needed break to hang out with daddy’s special princess #1.\\n\\nI’m heading out of town today to see a show, but I’ll respond when I have the time if anyone has any questions. Good luck everyone out there grinding away. YOU CAN DO THIS TOO!  \n",
