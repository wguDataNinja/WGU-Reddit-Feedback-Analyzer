    "# Sentiment Threshold QA Notebook\n",

    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tests whether the current Ivy filter for Reddit posts (VADER sentiment below -0.3) is too strict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Some posts with borderline or neutral sentiment may still contain help-seeking signals that Ivy should include.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loads recent posts mentioning the top 5 most discussed WGU courses (C214, D427, C211, C213, C207)\n",
    "- Combines organic and keyword posts\n",
    "- Filters to posts with 1–3 course mentions to avoid planning noise\n",
    "- Recomputes VADER sentiment scores\n",
    "- Labels posts into sentiment bands\n",
    "- Checks for help-seeking keywords in borderline and neutral bands\n",
    "- Outputs samples and counts to help decide if the filter needs adjustment"

       "0  Hi all—passed this course the first time with less than 6 hrs of study. Didn’t feel like I retained any of the info I studied but I suppose I did lol. I do not recommend doing what I did. My recommendation is to complete the study guide yourself and watch the course videos. However, the only resource I used was the already completed study guide on the student drive from the unofficial WGU discord for students. Linked below. You’ll have to go thru the quick process to get into the MBA IT Management section.\\n\\nhttps://discord.gg/unwgu\\n\\nhttps://storage.studentdrive.org/s/WGU?dir=/Business/MBAITM/C211%20-%20Global%20Economics%20for%20Managers&openfile=true  \n",

       "      <td>Hey everyone! This subreddit has been incredibly helpful throughout my MBA journey, so I just wanted to give back and hopefully help others who are on their way.\\n\\nMy background:\\n\\n* I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Management in 2015—so it's been 10 years, and honestly, **I don’t remember almost anything I learned in school**. I mention that because the knowledge I gained during college didn’t really prepare me for my career. Everything I use today comes from hands-on experience, training, and continuous learning on the job. Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a manager across various industries, including restaurants, tech, senior living, and currently, pharma.\\n* I'm a full-time worker, and I have a family (no kid yet), so I do have free evenings and weekends to study\\n* I'm just an average 32-year-old guy—no photographic memory, no ability to breeze through a class in a day or two like some others claim. I’ll share my experience honestly, without saying, *“Oh, this topic was easy for me because I already knew it through my work.”* That’s not the case for me. Every course required effort, and I had to study to pass—nothing came automatically.\\n* What else? I'm an ESL person, meaning English knew me, but I didn't know English until later. I came here when I was 15, so yes try hard and you'll able to go through this too.\\n\\nWhat you need:\\n\\n* Buy whiteboard (marker included) and webcam set from WGU when your they send you a link. This is easier and cheaper compared to buying a webcam, a mini tripod, and small whiteboard + marker on your own\\n* Just a normal $20 scientific calculator from Walgreens is enough\\n* Create an account on chatgpt, just a free one, no need to pay or upgrade (I've never used Grammarly, you get this for free from WGU, but there's no need)\\n\\nPreparation:\\n\\nPhysically:\\n\\n* Be ready to study about 2-3 hrs/day, about 4-5 days a week\\n* Losing sleep and long day: study late before an exam, wake up early (5:30a) to go to the office to take OA exams at 6:50a (I live in West Coast), and I usually finish my exam within 2 hours, so that I can start to get back to workGive myself break after passing an OA class Reward myself a boba\\n\\nMentally:\\n\\n* All of the following are very normal :\"This is bullshit\" , \"Why did I even start\", \"Fuck this shit\", \"These mofos are making up words now, and it makes no sense\". Yup, go ahead a vent it, then get back to it lol (remember those meme?)\\n* MEMORIZATION, MEMORIZATION, MEMORIZATION\\n   * **Understanding is very important**, and that's one thing, but if you don't kinda remember keywords/scenarios, or the questions themselves, then well, use common sense and choose the best answer\\n* REMEMBER WHY YOU START:\\n   * MONEY: I don't sugarcoat things, so yes, I need MBA to advance\\n   * I want my parents to retire and I can help them - MONEY\\n   * I want my take good care of my wife and my children (yes, she's pregnant) - MONEY\\n   * My parents will be super proud since no one in my entire family has MBA\\n\\nLet's start the journey:\\n\\nFor all PA classes (C200, 204, 206, 207, 212, 216), you can finish in 1 day for each class:\\n\\n* Don't even try to prepare since there's no prompt available before starting the course, and the prompt is way too long for anyone to remember, but there's nothing to worry about\\n* No, I didn't even open the books for these classes\\n* Your Course Instructor will not grade your paper. I know this because when I got my first revision, the instructor didn't know what I did, and just copy &amp; paste the competencies in the prompt. What does this mean? CLEARLY STATE YOUR ANSWER, please keep reading\\n* **FOLLOW THE RUBRIC.** Each rubric has a title, so put that title in your PA so whoever will grade your PA will match that with the rubric.\\n   * Example: Explain why Final Fantasy X is the best game ever, and give 3 reasons.\\n   * Rubric title: Explanation why it's the best\\n      * Not competent: you didn't provide any reason\\n      * Approaching competent: you explained 2 reasons\\n      * Competent: you clearly explained all 3 reasons\\n   * In your PA:\\n      * Title of the section: Explanation why it's the best -&gt; tell them 3 reasons: **Yuna, music, and story** (yes, I bolded them on  purpose, so that grader can see it clearly)\\n      * Sub-sections: Yuna (elaborate), Music (elaborate), Story (eloborate)\\n\\nLet's go with OA (all my headaches and sufferings are from these):\\n\\n* Common question: is OA similar to Pre-A? -&gt; No, they're very different (except C214). OA is harder.\\n   * Let's say 1 concept has 3 categories. Pre-A will ask about category 1, and OA will ask you about category 2 or 3\\n   * Wording might be different, but looking for keywords\\n   * Also, sometimes it's reverse, meaning they'll give you the answer (the concept), and ask you the question (the scenario)\\n* Usually, OA will give you 4 answers, and 2 of them are just completely off, and for the other 2, one of them is correct, and the other one is pretty similar with slight changes, so use elimination method and figure out the best answer\\n* KEYWORDS are your friend. Memorize everything is hard, so learning keywords/ key phrases will limit what you have to remember.\\n* UNDERSTANDING is important too\\n* My strategy for every single OA:\\n   * Take the Pre-A right away. If you want to test your knowledge, go ahead because it'll lead to the same route anyway. For me, I speedrun that, so that I will know the answer.\\n   * They will give you a coaching report (give you the answers). Use that to copy to chatgpt to create a table of questions and answers.\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * What's the best thing about this? You can do this for all OA classes even before you start the class itself\\n\\nLet's tackle class by class with the order I took, and each class took me 1 week to study. And yes, these are all I did to pass.\\n\\n* C202: This class is an HR class, so many people might be familiar with it if you went through onboarding orientation, compliance and sexual harassment training\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * Do Chapter quizzes and quarterly quizzes\\n   * LOTS OF scenario questions in OA\\n* C213: Accounting\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * Do chapter quizzes (they are short, but helpful)\\n* C214: Financing\\n   * REALLY Study your Pre-A. ALL calculations questions are EXACTLY THE SAME, with very slight different. For example, instead of ask for cash, they ask you to calculate credit. but it's the same formula.\\n   * Dr. V videos are all you need\\n   * There's study guide, but it's very outdated, so I didn't use it\\n   * Quizlet with 200+ questions will also help\\n* C215: Operation Management\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * REALLY go through the completed study guide, you can find on Reddit\\n   * You can try to go through Terms and Definitions, but it's too much for me so I only skimmed through\\n* C207: Statistic (kinda)\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * Go through the videos provided in the course\\n   * \"Are you smarter than 5th grader\" slides\\n* C211: Econ (THE WORST/HARDEST for me, this is the only one I failed once and had to retake)\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * C211 Quizlet with 100 something questions REALLY helped to summarize the class\\n   * This is a post on reddit for C211 OA, and it's pretty accurate, so use it to study (https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/)\\n   * Study your chapter quizzes (I know it's a lot, but it'll help)\\n   * After I failed the first time. The professor gave me assignment to complete on competency 1, 4, and 5 (3 quizzes, about 30ish questions each). Use chatgpt to get the right answers, study them.\\n\\nThat's all I can remember for now. Feel free to ask any question just in case I missed anything since it's a long post\\n\\nAll I want to say is SUFFER FIRST, THEN ENJOY LATER (yes, you shall suffer lol)\\n\\nGOOD LUCK</td>\n",

       "      <td>Ok, let me just start by saying HOLY SHIT! These two classes make up the roughest stretch of WGU I have had yet, they are no joke. \\n\\nBUT, if you you practice you will pass, it took me two attempts at D426, I started this semester with this class and ended the last semester with this class, it was much harder than D427, the foundations of the course, if you don't know SQL already is rough, but if you can get down the terms you will be golden on the first class and it definitely help with the second class. \\n\\nNow, this applies to BOTH courses, DO THE LABS, yes zybooks sucks, its dry and boring, BUT its the key to both of these classes. If you can do the labs, you will pass the tests its that simple. Specifically for D427, but the labs in D426 actually help you understand the terms, the difference between DELETE and DROP, and ALTER and CHANGE, or a RIGHT JOIN and a LEFT JOIN. \\n\\nWith D427 the key is practice, and something that the instructor helped with in terms of practice is using ChatGPT, and using this exact prompt. “Your task is to act as a database and SQL study tutor. Please give me 5 intermediate-level SQL coding tasks which focus on DDL, DML, and DQL keywords. Evaluate my replies one at a time, and provide feedback on my work with suggestions forimprovement.\" \\n\\nKeep in mind that you can customize difficulty level, focus areas, etc. Which is beneficial, because if you are struggling with how to input a new column, or all of the variations of the ALTER command this can adjust! \\n\\nFinally, do not do anything on d427 that is not asked in the question, if it doesn't ask for an alias then don't do one, if it says a positive INT then make sure you make it unsigned, and make sure you spell check!!!!! I cannot stress this enough, I got so mad at myself testing my code and it would be wrong because of a missed letter or mixed up letter. Good luck everyone! I really hope this helps!</td>\n",

and I'm feeling so overwhelmed about the amount of information. I don't even know where to start. I have been reading alot of threads about different people's experience but I am looking for advice about what exactly to be reviewing and in what order. I just finished C207 and felt like THAT was an information overload but at least it felt somewhat organized in the express cohort page. This class feels like a big jumbled mess to me, and I have very little accounting background so I have myself in a bit of a panic that I'm not going to be able to finish this class by the end of my term (June). \\n\\n  \\nWhat materials should I be studying and in what order? Please help!!!  \n",

JOIN functions and the chapter 2 ZyBooks labs, got some questions if anyone can help. \\n\\n1. Will I see JOIN related questions as difficult as the chapter 2 lab questions? In particular, labs with three tables are killing me and I'd like to know if I'll see questions like that on the OA\\n\\n2. Any recommended resources for practicing multi-table joins would be awesome if anybody knows any. ZyBooks and the WGU provided resources just aren't working with my style of learning.   \n",
       "2  Hey everyone! This subreddit has been incredibly helpful throughout my MBA journey, so I just wanted to give back and hopefully help others who are on their way.\\n\\nMy background:\\n\\n* I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Business Management in 2015—so it's been 10 years, and honestly, **I don’t remember almost anything I learned in school**. I mention that because the knowledge I gained during college didn’t really prepare me for my career. Everything I use today comes from hands-on experience, training, and continuous learning on the job. Over the past decade, I’ve worked as a manager across various industries, including restaurants, tech, senior living, and currently, pharma.\\n* I'm a full-time worker, and I have a family (no kid yet), so I do have free evenings and weekends to study\\n* I'm just an average 32-year-old guy—no photographic memory, no ability to breeze through a class in a day or two like some others claim. I’ll share my experience honestly, without saying, *“Oh, this topic was easy for me because I already knew it through my work.”* That’s not the case for me. Every course required effort, and I had to study to pass—nothing came automatically.\\n* What else? I'm an ESL person, meaning English knew me, but I didn't know English until later. I came here when I was 15, so yes try hard and you'll able to go through this too.\\n\\nWhat you need:\\n\\n* Buy whiteboard (marker included) and webcam set from WGU when your they send you a link. This is easier and cheaper compared to buying a webcam, a mini tripod, and small whiteboard + marker on your own\\n* Just a normal $20 scientific calculator from Walgreens is enough\\n* Create an account on chatgpt, just a free one, no need to pay or upgrade (I've never used Grammarly, you get this for free from WGU, but there's no need)\\n\\nPreparation:\\n\\nPhysically:\\n\\n* Be ready to study about 2-3 hrs/day, about 4-5 days a week\\n* Losing sleep and long day: study late before an exam, wake up early (5:30a) to go to the office to take OA exams at 6:50a (I live in West Coast), and I usually finish my exam within 2 hours, so that I can start to get back to workGive myself break after passing an OA class Reward myself a boba\\n\\nMentally:\\n\\n* All of the following are very normal :\"This is bullshit\" , \"Why did I even start\", \"Fuck this shit\", \"These mofos are making up words now, and it makes no sense\". Yup, go ahead a vent it, then get back to it lol (remember those meme?)\\n* MEMORIZATION, MEMORIZATION, MEMORIZATION\\n   * **Understanding is very important**, and that's one thing, but if you don't kinda remember keywords/scenarios, or the questions themselves, then well, use common sense and choose the best answer\\n* REMEMBER WHY YOU START:\\n   * MONEY: I don't sugarcoat things, so yes, I need MBA to advance\\n   * I want my parents to retire and I can help them - MONEY\\n   * I want my take good care of my wife and my children (yes, she's pregnant) - MONEY\\n   * My parents will be super proud since no one in my entire family has MBA\\n\\nLet's start the journey:\\n\\nFor all PA classes (C200, 204, 206, 207, 212, 216), you can finish in 1 day for each class:\\n\\n* Don't even try to prepare since there's no prompt available before starting the course, and the prompt is way too long for anyone to remember, but there's nothing to worry about\\n* No, I didn't even open the books for these classes\\n* Your Course Instructor will not grade your paper. I know this because when I got my first revision, the instructor didn't know what I did, and just copy & paste the competencies in the prompt. What does this mean? CLEARLY STATE YOUR ANSWER, please keep reading\\n* **FOLLOW THE RUBRIC.** Each rubric has a title, so put that title in your PA so whoever will grade your PA will match that with the rubric.\\n   * Example: Explain why Final Fantasy X is the best game ever, and give 3 reasons.\\n   * Rubric title: Explanation why it's the best\\n      * Not competent: you didn't provide any reason\\n      * Approaching competent: you explained 2 reasons\\n      * Competent: you clearly explained all 3 reasons\\n   * In your PA:\\n      * Title of the section: Explanation why it's the best -> tell them 3 reasons: **Yuna, music, and story** (yes, I bolded them on  purpose, so that grader can see it clearly)\\n      * Sub-sections: Yuna (elaborate), Music (elaborate), Story (eloborate)\\n\\nLet's go with OA (all my headaches and sufferings are from these):\\n\\n* Common question: is OA similar to Pre-A? -> No, they're very different (except C214). OA is harder.\\n   * Let's say 1 concept has 3 categories. Pre-A will ask about category 1, and OA will ask you about category 2 or 3\\n   * Wording might be different, but looking for keywords\\n   * Also, sometimes it's reverse, meaning they'll give you the answer (the concept), and ask you the question (the scenario)\\n* Usually, OA will give you 4 answers, and 2 of them are just completely off, and for the other 2, one of them is correct, and the other one is pretty similar with slight changes, so use elimination method and figure out the best answer\\n* KEYWORDS are your friend. Memorize everything is hard, so learning keywords/ key phrases will limit what you have to remember.\\n* UNDERSTANDING is important too\\n* My strategy for every single OA:\\n   * Take the Pre-A right away. If you want to test your knowledge, go ahead because it'll lead to the same route anyway. For me, I speedrun that, so that I will know the answer.\\n   * They will give you a coaching report (give you the answers). Use that to copy to chatgpt to create a table of questions and answers.\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * What's the best thing about this? You can do this for all OA classes even before you start the class itself\\n\\nLet's tackle class by class with the order I took, and each class took me 1 week to study. And yes, these are all I did to pass.\\n\\n* C202: This class is an HR class, so many people might be familiar with it if you went through onboarding orientation, compliance and sexual harassment training\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * Do Chapter quizzes and quarterly quizzes\\n   * LOTS OF scenario questions in OA\\n* C213: Accounting\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * Do chapter quizzes (they are short, but helpful)\\n* C214: Financing\\n   * REALLY Study your Pre-A. ALL calculations questions are EXACTLY THE SAME, with very slight different. For example, instead of ask for cash, they ask you to calculate credit. but it's the same formula.\\n   * Dr. V videos are all you need\\n   * There's study guide, but it's very outdated, so I didn't use it\\n   * Quizlet with 200+ questions will also help\\n* C215: Operation Management\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * REALLY go through the completed study guide, you can find on Reddit\\n   * You can try to go through Terms and Definitions, but it's too much for me so I only skimmed through\\n* C207: Statistic (kinda)\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * Go through the videos provided in the course\\n   * \"Are you smarter than 5th grader\" slides\\n* C211: Econ (THE WORST/HARDEST for me, this is the only one I failed once and had to retake)\\n   * Study your Pre-A\\n   * C211 Quizlet with 100 something questions REALLY helped to summarize the class\\n   * This is a post on reddit for C211 OA, and it's pretty accurate, so use it to study (https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/)\\n   * Study your chapter quizzes (I know it's a lot, but it'll help)\\n   * After I failed the first time. The professor gave me assignment to complete on competency 1, 4, and 5 (3 quizzes, about 30ish questions each). Use chatgpt to get the right answers, study them.\\n\\nThat's all I can remember for now. Feel free to ask any question just in case I missed anything since it's a long post\\n\\nAll I want to say is SUFFER FIRST, THEN ENJOY LATER (yes, you shall suffer lol)\\n\\nGOOD LUCK  \n",

SHIT! These two classes make up the roughest stretch of WGU I have had yet, they are no joke. \\n\\nBUT, if you you practice you will pass, it took me two attempts at D426, I started this semester with this class and ended the last semester with this class, it was much harder than D427, the foundations of the course, if you don't know SQL already is rough, but if you can get down the terms you will be golden on the first class and it definitely help with the second class. \\n\\nNow, this applies to BOTH courses, DO THE LABS, yes zybooks sucks, its dry and boring, BUT its the key to both of these classes. If you can do the labs, you will pass the tests its that simple. Specifically for D427, but the labs in D426 actually help you understand the terms, the difference between DELETE and DROP, and ALTER and CHANGE, or a RIGHT JOIN and a LEFT JOIN. \\n\\nWith D427 the key is practice, and something that the instructor helped with in terms of practice is using ChatGPT, and using this exact prompt. “Your task is to act as a database and SQL study tutor. Please give me 5 intermediate-level SQL coding tasks which focus on DDL, DML, and DQL keywords. Evaluate my replies one at a time, and provide feedback on my work with suggestions forimprovement.\" \\n\\nKeep in mind that you can customize difficulty level, focus areas, etc. Which is beneficial, because if you are struggling with how to input a new column, or all of the variations of the ALTER command this can adjust! \\n\\nFinally, do not do anything on d427 that is not asked in the question, if it doesn't ask for an alias then don't do one, if it says a positive INT then make sure you make it unsigned, and make sure you spell check!!!!! I cannot stress this enough, I got so mad at myself testing my code and it would be wrong because of a missed letter or mixed up letter. Good luck everyone! I really hope this helps!  "

    "## Observations: Initial Keyword Override Samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these initial samples, we can see how well the simple keyword override works when applied to borderline, neutral, and positive VADER bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Borderline Negative  \n",
    "- Example: *\"Does anyone who completed the course recently have any recommended video resources? I am struggling...\"*  \n",
    "  - Clear, direct help request with a question. Good candidate for Ivy.\n",
    "- Example: *\"My recommendation is to complete the study guide yourself...\"*  \n",
    "  - This is giving advice, not seeking help. A borderline false positive for the word \"recommend\". Does not need Ivy if the goal is only to cluster open questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neutral  \n",
    "- Examples: *\"Has anyone else figured this out?\"*, *\"Need all the advice I can get.\"*, *\"What should I do for a second attempt?\"*  \n",
    "  - All of these are clear requests for information or next steps. These would be missed if relying on the sentiment filter alone. These should be passed to Ivy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positive  \n",
    "- Examples:  \n",
    "   - *\"Any recommendations?\"* — direct help ask, valid.  \n",
    "   - *\"Has anyone got suggestions...?\"* — direct help ask, valid.  \n",
    "   - *\"I passed today, I just want anybody searching for advice, I got you.\"* — this is giving advice, not seeking help. Adds noise if sent to Ivy for help-seeking clusters.  \n",
    "   - *\"Struggling to Stay Focused... What Helped You Get Through It?\"* — direct help question, valid.  \n",
    "   - *\"Just passed C214 New exam... Make sure you do X, Y, Z.\"* — mostly a success story and retrospective tips, not an open help request.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points  \n",
    "Some neutral and borderline posts are strong true positives.  \n",
    "Some positive posts with keywords are clear help asks.  \n",
    "Some positive posts with the same keywords are just advice posts or praise with no open question. These do not need the Ivy pipeline for clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Means  \n",
    "The initial keyword override does help recover valid borderline and neutral help-seeking posts that the sentiment threshold alone would miss.  \n",
    "Generic words like \"recommend\" or \"advice\" by themselves can pull posts that are only sharing success tips.  \n",
    "The filter should keep borderline and neutral posts with strong patterns, but for clearly positive posts, add a stronger condition such as requiring a question mark or a phrase like \"Does anyone\" or \"How do I\" to ensure it is actually a help request.  \n",
    "This confirms the original VADER-only cutoff would miss real help-seeking signals, so some override is needed, but it should be more precise to avoid sending pure success stories or answer posts through Ivy’s heavier pipeline."

    "## Results Summary: Two-Layer Filter in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "This run confirms that the negative sentiment threshold and the keyword override each capture different but complementary signals, which matches the design intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overall Data\n",
    "- Total posts analyzed: 254\n",
    "- Posts with clear help-seeking: 155  \n",
    "  This means about 61 percent of all posts contain explicit questions, advice requests, or resource-seeking signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Sentiment Bands\n",
    "- Most posts are neutral or positive in tone, which is normal for general course discussions.\n",
    "- Negative bands do contain strong signals too: more than half the posts in the highly negative or moderately negative range contain help-seeking or frustration.\n",
    "- The borderline and neutral bands show that many help requests are polite or phrased calmly, which the sentiment cutoff alone would miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Threshold Effect\n",
    "- The threshold table shows that using a more aggressive sentiment cutoff alone quickly reduces recall.\n",
    "- For example, at -0.5 you capture only 18 help-seeking posts out of 155, missing 137. \n",
    "- At -0.3 you capture 23, still missing more than 130.\n",
    "- Raising the cutoff to zero would increase recall, but that approach is too broad and would flood the pipeline with noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Context Snippets Confirm the Pattern\n",
    "- The samples show that borderline and neutral posts contain genuine questions, study resource requests, and advice-seeking.\n",
    "- These polite requests are exactly the type of post that benefits from Ivy’s deeper taxonomy and clustering stages.\n",
    "- Negative posts show direct frustration or complaints that reveal root causes and blockers even if no question is asked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Practical Implication\n",
    "\n",
    "These results confirm that the two-layer approach is the right design:\n",
    "- Keep the negative sentiment threshold to sweep in frustration, blockers, and pain points that are not worded as questions.\n",
    "- Add a keyword override so that clear help requests in neutral or positive tone are included.\n",
    "- Together, this ensures the Ivy pipeline receives both implicit and explicit signals for deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The threshold table also shows that the current cutoff at -0.3 is a reasonable balance: it automatically includes high-pain posts but relies on the keyword pass to ensure polite help-seeking is not missed."

    "- GPT-4o is more generous in labeling mild confusion or frustration as pain points, leading to higher counts in all negative sentiment bands.\n",
    "- GPT-4-5-research is stricter, marking only clear blockers or obvious friction.\n",
    "- Despite the difference in strictness, both models show the same trend: posts with stronger negative sentiment (below -0.2) consistently contain the majority of real pain points.\n",
    "- Both models agree that posts with neutral or positive sentiment (>-0.1) almost never contain actionable pain points.\n",
    "- Because both show that the share of real pain points drops sharply above -0.2, both models support using **-0.2 as an effective threshold** to flag posts for pain point review."
