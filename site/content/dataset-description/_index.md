This site displays a fixed snapshot of public Reddit posts that reference WGU courses.  
The snapshot was derived by filtering a larger collection of over 30,000 Reddit posts from WGU-related subreddits to include posts referencing a single course and describing student-reported difficulty.

Courses shown on the site are drawn from the **June 2025 WGU institutional course catalog**.

The snapshot includes posts created between **June 18, 2018** and **October 3, 2025**.

Counts shown on the site represent posts, not students.  
They reflect discussion volume only.

## How the summaries should be read

Posts are grouped to make large volumes of discussion easier to browse.

**Difficulty categories** group similar student-reported difficulties within a course.

**Cross-course categories** align related difficulty categories across multiple courses.

Category names summarize patterns in student discussion. They are not official classifications and do not represent evaluations, rankings, or institutional judgments.

## What the site does not do

The site does not measure satisfaction, performance, or outcomes.  
Ordering reflects post volume only.
