title: "WGU Reddit Analyzer"
---

This site accompanies the **WGU Reddit Analyzer** project, an LLM (Large Language Model) pipeline used to analyze Reddit posts about WGU courses. The pipeline processes a fixed snapshot of posts to surface commonly discussed difficulties and converts noisy social media text into structured data that can be examined by course or college.

This snapshot includes **1,103 posts across 242 courses**, filtered for low sentiment. Counts reflect discussion volume (posts), not students, and do not measure satisfaction or performance.
