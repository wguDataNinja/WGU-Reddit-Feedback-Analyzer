I am currently doing task 1 for D355 and I am using the Grammerly extension on MS Word while I write. I have been very nervous about being told I am using AI to write my papers because I have heard some horror stories of students that have not used AI but they still get their paper flagged. While working on my paper today, I used Grammerly to check for plagiarism and AI and a whole sentence along with bullet points where I am typing out mandatory benefits gets flagged by Grammerly as use of AI. I am horrified by this because I do not know the first thing about using AI and prefer to stay ignorant to it.

I started the course on April 29th- studied basically all day and took the pre-assessment at midnight (4/30). I didn’t pass it. April 30th (last day of my term) I called out of work and studied more, then took the pre-assessment again and passed so at 1030am I took the OA. I failed. The PA and OA really aren’t THAT similar in this course. I quickly requested to retake the test and scheduled it for the only time still available 1030pm and started studying again. I officially started the assessment at 1057pm and finished it at 1231am EST (5/1). I’ve seen that as long as you start the test before midnight at the end of your term, you’re fine.
