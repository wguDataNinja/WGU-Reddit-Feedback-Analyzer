I also have to submit screenshots of all practice exams. Once everything is done and submitted then I can get approval. \n\nI feel like this is way overboard. The sheer amount of time it would consume is insane when I didn't completely bomb my first attempt. Has anyone experienced this?

I have 5 classes left and 3 months to go, so I have plenty of time, not trying to rush it.

The instructions were very well drafted and I followed them. I have my screenshots.\n\nQuestion #1: There's a FW policy that allows incoming traffic on this particular port. Am I to delete this FW rule and inject the one the instructions tell me to? See screenshot:  \nThe first line is my input.

Select \"Search Online\" and \"open file location\". Am I supposed to do anything with these? Like is there other steps I must take to \"remediate\" because I completed all the steps and the threat is gone but the EXE is still eating up 99% CPU usage. When I search the web, MS says Defender removes the threat. I re-ran the scan and it is not reporting, yet the offending EXE is still there. There is a sub-process I identified and it doesn't show in Add/Remove Programs. Am I expected to uninstall this subprocess? There's also Registry Keys associated with the main EXE and sub-process. I COULD delete them. but am I expected to delete and note it in my paper under the remediation section? I have uninstalled the offending application but it keeps coming back.\n\nQuestion #3 \"additional notes and observations\" for both Investigate and remediate, what exactly am I supposed to be putting in here? I guess I could put the above additional sub-process in the investigate portion. But for the remediation? I guess if I do actually perform the removal of the EXE and sub-process that would go here? Or am I missing the whole point?\n\nAny assistance is greatly appreciated.  \nThank you", "raw_response_text": "Here's my assessment:\n\n{\n\"contains_painpoint\": \"y\",\n\"confidence\": 0.8,\n\"pain_points\": [\n{\n\"root_cause_summary\": \"Unclear instructions or evaluator expectations in the Remediation section of the PA Incident Response Report lab.\",\n\"pain_point_snippet\": \"Question #1: There's a FW policy that allows incoming traffic on this particular port.
