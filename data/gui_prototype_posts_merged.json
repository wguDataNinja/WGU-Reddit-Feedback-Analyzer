My goal is to\u00a0**maximize Sophia.org and Study.com credits**\u00a0and hit the 75% transfer limit if possible.\n\nHere\u2019s my current situation:\n\n* I already have credit for\u00a0**C955: Applied Probability and Statistics**.\n* I\u2019ve mapped out a sequence of courses to take on\u00a0**Sophia first**, then finish the rest on\u00a0**Study.co**m targeting all that\u2019s transferable.\n* After that, I\u2019ll do the WGU-only courses in their system.\n* I\u2019m trying to do this ALL\u00a0**before June 1st**, so I can start fresh with only WGU-exclusive classes left.\n\n**My Ask**  \nCan you take a look at the plan and let me know:\n\n1. Is this timeline realistic for completing before June 1st?\n2. Is the sequence of courses logical (Sophia \u2192 Study.com)?\n3. Would you adjust the order or cut/add anything?\n\n[Here\u2019s the course plan I\u2019ve built (Google Sheet/Doc)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qpDA4PLU4gfA3iwnvtTmnlYDKMvAzDMu/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107310424780262361408&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n\n\nAny thoughts or experience would be hugely appreciated.

    "selftext": "I had to do a lot of trial and error to get to this score. Usually video courses work great for me, but this time it just wasn't sticking. Here's what I believe would be most efficient for me if I had to do it all again (and possibly for you too doing it now!):\n\nI'd start by reading the syllabus and answering all of the questions using the information from the Axelos book and relating things to\u00a0*something*\u00a0I'm familiar with (like work or school or a store I love shopping at). The syllabus outlines the exact definitions and topics you need to know, and where in the Axelos book to find them. Then I'd read Claire Agutter's Essentials book end to end, supplementing my existing syllabus answers with the extra information that seems useful. Next, I'd make flashcards to memorize definitions, main concepts, and some of the extra fluff that I might encounter on the test. Finally, any topic I find myself struggling with I would break down into simpler terms. I'd take some practice exams (highly recommend Dion though you should know his exams aren't perfect) to confirm I'm good to go by regularly scoring 80%+. Right before the exam, I'd read Dion's cram card to just get a final reminder of all the terms. I wouldn't actually bother with any of the video material personally, but there's a lot of videos out there that helped others so I wouldn't be afraid to try them either if this didn't seem like it would work. All of these materials are accessible for free through various WGU resources (the Axelos book is in the course material, the cram card was in a welcome email, and Claire's book was linked in my Voucher Approval email).\n\nAlso, my mentor told me I'd have to pass a pre-assessment exam before getting the voucher - she was wrong and that was not required. Thankfully they got my voucher to me really fast once I started the process.",

Would it be worth my time to take the (optional) labs and teach myself how to convert them to another language like Python? I've already been doing it through unit 4, and while it's slowing me down, I definitely feel like I understand the principles a lot better.\n\nI don't know how much programming comes up in the actual IT field after graduation, but I feel like having familiarity with a commonly used language is better than not having it.\n\nThoughts?",

    "selftext": "As title says, passed the ITIL Foundations exam. This exam was passed overnight and I felt it was pretty easy. The hardest part of this is the lack of transparency on where to learn the material. Of course you have your typical go-to's like Jason Dion, but I actually found his ITIL course NOT helpful. The exam is built on key definitions and ITIL is ambiguous as it is applied in different structures and models dependent on the organization using ITIL. For me it seemed Jason Dion's videos were more set in stone on what ITIL looks like as a bigger picture rather than broken down to each component of ITIL for you to understand. I stopped watching the videos about 40 minutes in.\n\nSurprisingly, Youtube saved the day. After about 5 hours of studying using the free playlist by value insights (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf) and 2 mock exams by Jason Dion, I took the test right after with PeopleCert and passed with an 88% (35 out of 40 questions).\n\nI would not stress the analogies given to each concept such as user and customer and service provider so much. Or the diagrams showing SVS & SVC. That only complicated things for me midway through the videos.\n\nOverall I would say this is definitely an easy course but the more you stress it, the more you're going to struggle. At least that was my experience :).",

    "selftext": "update: I did all of the end of unit tests, watched all of the cohorts, and studied the preassessment ALL day long. Just took the test and passed a little past the competency line! \n\nI am almost done with all of the course material and completing the study guide. I took the preassessment and barely passed.\n\nI've searched past Reddit posts but I haven't come across anything recent for the OA. Do you have any tried and true links to help pass this course on the first try? I'm reading that the OA doesn't align with the preassessment at all and that the wording for the OA questions is very tricky. I'm down to my last two courses and I think I'm letting this freak me out more than it should - I've been putting this OA off for a little over a month. I'm hoping someone that has had to do a retake plan can give me a little more to study so I don't fail. I guess my questions are these:\n\n1. What supplemental study information helped you pass? Links would make me add you to my prayer list :)\n2. The email I got from the instructor says all sections are weighted equally but others have said section 2 was weighted more. How do you feel the OA was distributed? Anything stick out to you specifically?\n3. If you had to do a retake plan, what did it consist of? I've googled but I'm not finding anything but the same study guide posted.\n4. Just to help ease my anxiety, how would you describe the verbiage for the OA questions? It looks like a LOT of people have complained about how tricky the questions can be (most say there are 3 correct answers but one REALLY correct answer), while others say they struggled to be able to differentiate between the three correct answers as which would be best. I'M FREAKING OUT OVER HERE!\n\nI appreciate any help or insight you're able/willing to provide. I've got to finish this one and Economics then I'm done and honestly, these two have been the hardest ever for me. Not sure if it's because I'm so close to being done that I can't focus anymore if they're actually hard. I'm giving myself this week to finish both since I've been in them since the beginning of January with no progress.",

    "title": "D288 Tips 2025",
    "selftext": "Just wanted to post an update on D288 as of 3/2025 since the project instructions have changed quite a bit over the years. I got my project returned with some super vague evaluator comments but after reading the course check off list (https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e2rCAA&groupId=&searchTerm=&courseCode=D288&rtn=/apex/CommonsExpandedSearch) and about 500 different Reddit posts I was able to deduce what I needed. \n\nAlso wanted to address that in the check off list above it says: \u2022 IMPORTANT-as of 11/2024, Angular appears to have upgraded its libraries. In the [Division.java](http://Division.java) entity, the front end also needs an additional constructor, as shown in [**Add Customer Form Fix**](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=52d84340-5ac0-4463-896b-b2230009668a)public Division(String url) {\n\n[this.id](http://this.id) = Long.parseLong(url.substring(url.lastIndexOf('/')+1));\n\n} i didnt end up even needing to put that code in but if you cant get your customers to save then maybe it will be useful... Theres also an instructor video showing exactly how/where to add it in (https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=52d84340-5ac0-4463-896b-b2230009668a)\n\nAlso another thing that was super helpful which the instructor told us to do in the videos was to go into your [application.properties](http://application.properties) folder and change the last line to say `logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG`as that will give you much more detailed error logs and help you debug a lot faster.\n\nFor part G(write validators etc.) remember you cant use external libraries so spring boot validation is a no go(@NotNull @ NotBlank etc.). Also you\u2019ll need to make sure your implementation code has a loop that makes sure the cart is 1. Not null 2. Not empty and 3. The cart items isnt empty/null. of any of those are true, then also make sure it outputs a meaningful message saying something like cart cant be empty or whatever. You\u2019ll also need validation to make sure the party is not less than 1. Again, if it is, output a meaningful message.\n\nThe impl file itself was a hassle for me and I had to change the order of my code a million times so I\u2019ll stress that even if the code itself is perfect the order of the saving and getting and looping really does matter.\n\nAlso the versions I used for the project were Java 17, spring boot 3.3.6, and maven 3.8.1 (I had to change these multiple times and all the Reddit posts were saying to do different versions as well as the course checklist page itself)\u00a0Also be wary of some of the stuff in that checklist it says that part G isn\u2019t being evaluated anymore as of 4/24 and that was just not accurate for me.\u00a0\n\nAlso another issue I was struggling with big time was my database just not connecting. I found one Reddit post comment that was my saving grace : \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_CompSci/comments/168qz83/comment/lrbh26t/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_CompSci/comments/168qz83/comment/lrbh26t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nI covered what tripped me up the most but if anyone has any questions please let me know and I\u2019ll be happy to help out where I can!!",

Here is my advice:\n\nDon't go through the financial statements in the order! I got too much information mixed up the first time and couldn't master them individually. Instead, I went through the introduction to financial statements, and after I finished the section about the Balance Sheets, I cut to the Balance Sheet chapter, and went through that. Then, I went back and did the intro to Income Statements, and then did the chapter, same with the Statement of Cash Flows. This helped me really master each financial statement on its own, and made my learning go more smoothly. \n\nI also watched all the videos, and did all of the end of chapter quizzes. With the quizzes, if I missed any questions, I used ChatGPT to take me step by step through the question and explain it to me. It really worked well, as long as I included what the answer should be.  A few times I didn't include the answers or tell it the right answer and ChatGPT gave me the wrong question. \n\nLastly, I did the PA on the same day I did the OA. I did the PA in the morning and reviewed the questions I got wrong a little bit right away, then I took a break, and came back later, reviewed the questions more and did the OA. The PA and OA are VERY similar, in fact I'm pretty sure I had duplicate questions on the OA, or at least they were so similar that I was able to pull from memory how to do them. \n\nOverall, I also found looking through Reddit and the Discord pages helped to boost my confidence, I was very worried about this class after failing last time. I am happy to say that the class isn't that bad. Good Luck!",

Also in the second table, in the totals for cell C35, where is retained earnings of $80k coming from? The top table has $60k so I'm a bit lost.\n3.

It took me 2 weeks because I apparently requested to take the exam too early.  I waited 10 days for approval which set me back a lot.  Anyways make sure you study anything related to the word \"incident\", \"service desk\", \"service request\".  I think like 50% of the question on my version had those words.  AND PLEASE study the terms front to back!!! I had so many questions that were just matching the term with definition.\n\n**MY NEW STUDY ROUTIN ID SUGGEST IN ORDER!!!!**\n\n\\- Watch Value Insights playlist\n\n\\- Study the JAson Dion 6 exams and use the cram card to study (check course search for it).  **I LEARNED THE MOST FROM HERE.**\n\n\\-Study the 6 exams again.  I Averaged around 80% on first round and 87% on my second round.  The first exam on the first round I got like 65% but then the next tests got easier and easier as I studied the incorrect answers which led to me passing better on the next exams.  These exams are the closest (still somewhat far) to the real exam.\n\n\\- Take the github [exam](https://d12.github.io/itil-quiz/index.html) to determine your skill level since these questions are harder. I averaged 75% on my 4 highest scores.\n\n**People say that the VI playlist was their only study routine think but I would've failed only using that. I say DIOn practice tests helped like 85% and the VI videos filled in some gaps.  those gaps were important though!!! I had some questions that only were shown in the VI videos!**\n\ni suggest not to take the CyberVista exam because that honestly confused me more that it helped.  I got 50% on first test and 70% on second test. Not needed.\n\n\\-my proctor was decent.",

    "selftext": "Just completed D333. Took me around 2 months(procrastination and 2 failed attempts).This class is not difficult its a matter of taking your time and actually reading through the question and what its asking you. Also in each question there is a keyword that is usually an indicator to what the correct answer is(this specific tip works best on the questions about laws and ethics ).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oox536zsklve1.png?width=633&format=png&auto=webp&s=9633aff1a1094570b7027c65361c329455e73104\n\n Another thing is once you have the laws and ethical frameworks memorized, you know about 50% - 60% of the OA. Another part of the OA that I struggled a lot on is around questions 40-60 they begin asking you questions on a lot of obscure things. The CI's will tell you that the OA is mostly laws, but fail to mention(not their fault since they don't have access to the OA) the more obscure things like what is a reasonable professional, or what is considered negligence etc. Ensure you know AI bias, E-discovery, proxy bias etc. Also the OA asks about the software engineering code of ethics as well as IT code of ethics. Please ensure you know the PAPA model and the CIA triad. There will be at least 3 questions about them. Further more.I remember there was a question regarding an IT manager taking on a project and the client kept asking for more features which increased scope creep. There was also a question that is along the lines of 'A user is selling a product on an e-commerce website and he fails to mention and test if the product works' in this question you have to think about if they this is fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract etc.(Not giving out what the answer is but this WILL be a question that shows up but don't stress it too much.) \n\nHere are some study resources: \n\n[quizlet](https://quizlet.com/784187648/wgu-d333-ethics-in-technology-wgu-flash-cards/) with over 300 terms \n\n[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vqHCZYMgKoKTQF4IXGoldfk_8aI8JaYq/view?pli=1) of the laws\n\nAll [powerpoints](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/apex/CourseArticle?id=kA03x0000011e81CAA)\n\nChapter summary [study doc](https://srm--c.vf.force.com/servlet/servlet.FileDownload?retURL=https%3A%2F%2Fsrm--c.vf.force.com%2Fapex%2FFDP%2FCommonsExpandedChatter%3Fcode%3DD333&file=00PS600000EaPuJMAV&_CONFIRMATIONTOKEN=VmpFPSxNakF5TlMwd05DMHlNVlF4TXpvME5UbzFOUzQwTWpWYSxqNzVFaG8wcExjaThuYUpyZmRRbjUyUVhuQlZtdFA1R0xhQ1dzU1VDLXZnPSxZVEJoTmpobQ%3D%3D&common.udd.actions.ActionsUtilORIG_URI=%2Fservlet%2Fservlet.FileDownload) (can be found in course chatter)\n\nAlso I recommend speaking with your course instructor and having them provide you with a practice test. The practice test they provide will be worded completely different from the way the OA does(for the most part), but what it helps with is getting you in the mindset of reading the questions thoroughly and looking for keywords that indicate the BEST choice. There will be a lot of questions on the OA that seem correct, but are not the BEST choice(weird I know but the course instructors will explain).\n\nOne last tip that helped me is that all the study resources such as the PowerPoints, study doc, and laws pdf, I put them into Google's NotebookLM and asked it questions about the material. It helped me a lot. \n\n  \nSorry if this is all over the place but reach out if you have questions.\n\n TL;DR: Please ensure that once you memorize the laws and ethics DO NOT neglect the information in the course about the smaller things.",

Half of the topics in this course are common sense and you don't need to study the things that you can figure out on your own because the material is dense enough as it is. \n\nStep 2) Take the PA. The PA is not a good indicator of if you'll pass the OA anyways as they do not line up. I used this to be able to schedule my OA and to see which areas I was recommended to study. I did not pass my first attempt of the PA and did not retake it because it was basically pointless. \n\nStep 3) Review any of the Units that you are struggling to digest. For me, I was having difficulty with the topics that had a lot of minor things to remember (like specific requirements of special types of contracts i.e. mailbox rule, or the purpose of the specific types of financial acts) \n\nStep 4) Email John Prince and ask him for the difficult exam practice question that he has. Many people had complaints about John, but I can honestly say I would not have passed the OA without his help. He is very blunt, but you should not take that personally. He does not waste time sugar-coating things, he tells you directly why you are right or wrong so that you can actually learn from your mistakes. \n\nStep 5) After reviewing the exam questions from John, use Elin's outline to copy and paste the Units that you still don't understand into Notebook LM. This will create a podcast style explanation of the topic that makes it easier to comprehend. Follow along with the podcast and take notes as if you're learning it again for the first time. \n\nStep 6) Take the OA... I was not confident that I would pass this OA at all, but there was nothing left for me to do to try to better understand the material so I went for it. Thankfully, I passed with this method. \n\n  \nTopics to study for the OA: Securities Exchange Act of 1933, Garnishment, Artisan's and Mechanic's liens, tax and liability implications for different business structures (including liabilities in partnerships specifically), all of the Acts in Unit 8, Bankruptcies 7, 11, 13. \n\n  \nBe prepared when taking this exam, the wording is tricky and it's somewhat hard to decipher what they're even asking for. Good luck with this one, I'd give it a medium difficulty level just because of the denseness of the context and lack of confidence for the OA since the PA is useless. ",

    "title": "I passed D333 - Ethics in Technology in 19 days. Here's how I did it.",
    "selftext": "Greetings, Night Owls. I'm writing this guide to discuss the strategies and resources I used to be successful in Ethics in Technology.\n\nFirst of all, email your course instructor or the Ethics in Technology instructor group to ask for the study guide. The study guide is a 31-page document that will help you absorb and understand the textbook material as you read it. Use the study guide, read the relevant portions of the textbook it instructs you to read, and answer the study guide questions as you proceed. Engagement with the textbook is absolutely crucial to pass this class. There's no way out of it.\n\nOnce you've filled out the study guide, you can now begin studying in earnest. The study guide consists of 4 sections which contain study material relevant to the course (Sections 2-5). Study one of those 4 sections in the study guide each day. Furthermore, watch one of these recorded cohorts each day to strengthen your comprehension of the most important subject matter for the Objective Assessment:\n\nEthical Frameworks Cohort: [https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1f27ddf8-2c94-46e5-9581-b2260108cd94](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=1f27ddf8-2c94-46e5-9581-b2260108cd94)\n\nLaws and Regulations Cohort: [https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=31efef5b-fd39-4376-844b-b22601088703](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=31efef5b-fd39-4376-844b-b22601088703)\n\nAI Ethics and Bias Cohort: [https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cfef1c25-d243-4820-bd10-b226010904a1](https://wgu.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cfef1c25-d243-4820-bd10-b226010904a1)\n\n*Note that you need to be logged into your WGU student account in order to access the recorded cohorts.*\n\nAdditionally, email your course instructor or the Ethics in Technology instructor group to ask for the 8 practice quizzes relating to Ethical Frameworks/Professional Codes, Cybersecurity, Data Privacy, Information Accuracy, Intellectual Property, Information Access, the PAPA model, and the CIA triad respectively. Use these practice quizzes to gauge your understanding of the material. Concentrate on the questions you get wrong and understand why the answer you selected was incorrect.\n\nAfter studying for a week, you should be ready to take the Pre-Assessment. From my experience, the Pre-Assessment was similar to the Objective Assessment but obviously your mileage may vary. If you can pass the Pre-Assessment, you should be ready for the Objective Assessment. If you're feeling brave, then you can take the OA soon after passing the Pre-Assessment. But if you feel like you need a little more time to prepare, there's no shame in that.\n\nUsing these strategies and resources, I was able to pass the OA after being in the class for only 19 days. I could have passed sooner if I wasn't sick and had to take a few days off from studying due to that. The main takeaway here is to not underestimate this class simply because it's a general education class. This class will require steady effort and discipline in order for you to succeed. I believe in you, Night Owl! Good luck!",

I am just months ahead in my program and didn't mind any extra steps before being able to take the OA again. Which honestly can only help me if I didn't pass my initial attempt. \n\nNow my plan was to study if I needed to. But ONLY the material form the course. I was going to use Chat, feed it the pdf files for each chapter, then have it create detailed, but easy to follow notes. This is a good tactic to remove the bloat from chapters I didn't need. However.....\n\nThis exam is MUCH easier then I was made to believe.  I also believe in removing the anonymity aspect of the exam by attempting it so I can a better idea of the format of questions asked. I hate the tragic cycle of overly preparing for an exam THINKING that some sections are more included than others. Which was still true for this exam. For context i studied scripting like NO TOMORROW for the Pentest, and was only asked 3 questions in total about it. Same for all the acronyms. \n\nNext I will say, YOU ALREADY KNOW 80% of the stuff on this OA. If you have made it this far in the course, passed various others certs and exams, you are all ready prepared for this exam. Most of what I encountered I knew. For what I didnt, my context of the things I did KNOW made my guesses a 50/50 shot every time. And id take those odds any day. \n\nAll and all id say put your faith in YOUR abilities. You made it this far, you belong here, and you got this. You are more skilled than you think. Studying the material matters for sure for the things you don't know. However from my experience the exam consisted of more things that I did. \n\nGood luck out there yall!\n\n\n\n",

    "selftext": "As my WGU journey comes to a close, I just want to thank those trailblazers in this sub who helped me zero in and saved me from time wasted on \"pointless\" studying. I'm writing to share my experience with D487 because it was one course that I went at alone. \n\nThe class provides a lot of material to draw from, so those who are completely new to the material would have to take their time and drill down the concepts. It's similar to a CompTIA exam insomuch that one would need to understand the what and the why. If there were a question regarding a certain software dev framework, one would have to be able to recognize the framework, the key positions, and what their job role entails. Don't just stop at learning what STRIDE stands for; understand how it's implemented in SDL. Learn those phases, the deliverables, and the actions that lead to those deliverables. It's really an exercise in discerning \"where does this granular activity fit in the grand scheme?\"\n\nOne pro tip. All of the resources don't agree with each other; for instance, the book maps the SDL to a different version of an SDLC than what the class chooses to follow. So hit the lesson summaries and note the definitions and the 'what you learned' section on the summary page. I would say to learn those items and then work backward through the lesson pages and utilize the resource that mentions it. e.g., The SDLC that we're expected to know is discussed on Pluralsight.\n\nHopefully, all of this makes sense.

Under \"Course Search,\" I downloaded the *Study Questions and Competency* and *Terminology Quiz Questions*, then uploaded both PDFs into ChatGPT to generate multiple-choice questions. That was a huge help!\n\nMake sure you know:\n\n* **Equality Operators, Logical, and Relational Operators**\n* **The difference between the Waterfall Approach and the Spiral Approach** (Both follow the same SDLC)\n* **The difference between** `while` **loop,** `do-while` **loop, and** `for` **loop**\n* **The four key diagrams: Analysis, Design, Implementation, and Testing**\n* You may see a question like: *\"In the Waterfall approach, at what stage does the programmer begin to write code?\"* Just remember, whether it\u2019s Waterfall or Spiral, the cycle order is the same.\n\nAfter that, I took the PA and passed on my first attempt. I scheduled my OA for the same day and just finished with a passing score! No coding on the exam, and the math was super basic\u2014just be sure to bring a calculator.\n\nHere\u2019s the video playlist (I only watched Units 1, 2, 4, 7, and 8):  \n[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRf5DMgXLHAPm3KHH3AQZWoYzdk-FkFn7&si=3-DyqOpEIphz9GQM](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRf5DMgXLHAPm3KHH3AQZWoYzdk-FkFn7&si=3-DyqOpEIphz9GQM)\n\nHope this helps!",

Where the proctor told me to go to my Google Passwords page, on Chrome, like what? I know my password.... \n\nThen the proctor tells me, \"go ahead and download Letmein, and let me remote to fix this\" umm what? What do you need to remote in to do exactly? How about NO. \n\nSo I tell them, NO. They then say \"Well then you are going to have to reschedule for another day then\". To which I say what? Why? They start typing, I just closed the gaurdian window and restarted the test from WGU to a diffrent proctor and had no issues. \n\nThe entire thing, was insanely sketchy. The fact the dude wanted to remote, after he saw me copy password from Chrome and saw a ton of saved passwords in my browser, and then started to make it seem like I would have to give him access or lose my ability to test today was very sketchy.

I way overthought the class and this kept pushing it back, but if I had just 3 tips for people entering this course it would go as follows:\n\n1.  At the very least skim through the first 2 chapters a few times to refresh yourself on the terms and different queries.   This will help with the following steps.\n\n2.  The bulk of the exam is actually preforming SQL queries, so do every single practice prompt and lab in those first 2 chapters.  \n\n3.  The test and practice exam are very similar.  In each you will have a run code option under your problem.  This can help you to verify that you haven\u2019t made any critical errors in your syntax.\n\nBONUS:  CHATGPT is actually pretty good at writing the level of SQL required in this test.  I personally tried my best on the practice problems that didn\u2019t completely stump me and input the question into CHATGPT to compare and see where I may need to review specifically.  You should be able to run every query on the practice exam without assistance before trying your hand at the real deal (obviously).\n\nDon\u2019t overthink it.  It really does get simple with a few days of practice.\n\nHope this helps! ",

Everything else? Wordplay, vague phrasing, and trick question energy that has nothing to do with whether I learned the material.\n\nIf things don\u2019t start improving, I\u2019m transferring. I don\u2019t need this kind of stress. I have no issue learning and being tested, I welcome it, but don\u2019t try to confuse me just to see if I slip up.

The degree is nice, sure, but the time I\u2019m sinking into this could be spent building projects that\u2019ll actually get me a job.

The home setup was done with the link in said Reddit post. I swear I have everything name correctly. I have my SQL database connected through Intellij so I can see all the column names typed correctly, and I opened up all the front end TS files in Visual Studio Code to see what to name each variable.

I followed the Javabits video by Carolyn and as you can see in the picture, my code is written exactly as hers, but I get an error saying that the getID method can't be found when trying to start the app. I have @ Getter and @ Setter at the top of each class, so is this a Lombok issue not creating the methods?

I didnt finally get into the exam until about 7:45 after being passed around to technician to technician. I finished around 9:30. So basically it was a FIVE HOUR testing experience. In the midst of it all, \n\nI wrote a really emotional email to my mentor telling him how frustrating this is on top of normal testing anxiety. He said they had to switch to a more robust platform because there was a lot of cheating with the last one. I guess some dude took 20 people's OA for them? I feel like both things can be true though. They can have a need for a robust platform, and not keep using one that is causing so many issues for people. It is exhausting. I work full time, and dont have time for a half day testing experience. \n\nANYWAY, onto C214. It wasn't harder than the PA persay, but I found the questions to be a little more convoluted. Really read through the question multiple times to really make sure you are understanding what they are asking. A lot of the questions can be answered if you look at the formulas page and see what certain ones are indicating. \n\nI've seen a lot of people here say you dont need to focus that hard on the math, but I feel like this is an area where you can easily get 100% on if you know the excel inputs. If you do the chapter quizzes for the TVM, Bond, and NPV/IRR sections, they will give you a lot of practice for doing them for the exams in excel. \n\nTbh, I tried to just watch the videos at first, but it was not clicking. Also, not everything is covered in the videos that will be on the OA. Going through the book material was super helpful for me, but time consuming. What I would do to make it more easy to understand is copy and paste each section into ChatGPT and tell it to make the section more simple and easy to understand. I did this for the whole dang book, and it was so helpful. I made sure to take all of the quizzes too. \n\nI then went through and watched the accelerated videos, which only takes a few hours. \n\nAfter that, I went over the interactive concept quiz until I could do it and get 100%. \n\nI do suggest making sure you understand SEC, SOX, FINRA, statement of cash flows, FCFE, the strengths and weaknesses of CAPM and the Gordon Growth Model, common stock and preferred stock, diversification. The indirect method is most commonly used for statement of cash flows. Be able to identify what are current assets and liabilities in order to do a calculation. \n\nBut really for everything, read the question fully! You might be subtracting years, multiplying, dividing, etc based off the clues they give you! ",

Is it normal for the instructor to not allow a retake until you finish some quizzes they assign? I understand needing that extra practice if it's obvious someone really struggled in one area, but the only other time I didn't pass an OA the first time it was a very similar situation where I barely didn't make it, and I could almost immediately schedule my next retake without additional assignments from the instructor.\n\nJust frustrating IMO. I didn't know if most instructors did this or if it was just common for this class? Oh well, off to take some quizzes I guess. :P\n\nEdit 02/27/25: Well I just took my 2nd attempt and passed! Did I pass where the green doesn't even cross the black line? Yes. But a pass is a pass. I will say the quizzes did help, but also I just suck at economics. Good luck to everyone!",

Did I forget to mention, my goal was to complete my MBA before giving birth to my first baby at the end of this month?? Yes, a lot of pressure  but she was my motivation to accelerate! So i'm going to share with you all how I passed on my first try and THANK YOU ALL TO other reddit forums/advice because I'm passing the tips to anyone who's struggling to grasp the concepts in this class, as I sure did, especially the disengaging videos/material that literally put me to sleep and seriously discouraging! (Ahem..Dr. B..) \n\nOk here it goes! \ud83d\udcdd\n\n3 most important things: Review the reddit links below, review the WGU materials Additional Resources by Competency, and USE, I MEAN 100% take advantage of CHATGPT/Gemini to expand on unfamiliar terms and ask for examples!! \n\nBest resources EVER is by following the tips from these posts, and thank you to all who've shared this, I couldn't have done it! (Review everything, tables, charts, graphs!)\n\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/?rdt=47265\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1ieonoc/passed_c211/?rdt=51518#lightbox\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1i96cvj/c211_global_economics_for_managers_passed/?rdt=40637\n* https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/?rdt=62247\n\nDownload all the study guides, video transcripts, watch videos, the external videos from MRU were very helpful and engaging, do the supply and demand practice test provided in the competency resources, read/review the key terms for each! I didn\u2019t do the end of chapter exercises/practice exams. Take the PA, review it, ask ChatGPT for explanations, examples and in simpler terms - because I do not have any background in Economics, everything was just foreign to me. \n\nOk, sorry for the long post but here are the terms since it is still fresh: \ud83d\ude05\n* Globalization\n* GDP/MNE/FDI/PPP\n* Deadweight Loss\n* Market Structures: Perfect Competition/Monopolistic Competition/Oligopoly/Monopoly\n* Demand/Supply Curves \n* Consumer/Producer Surplus\n* Floating Exchange Rate\n* Forward Transactions/Discount Rate\n* Strategic Hedging\n* Greenfield Operation\n* Late Mover\n* Contender/Extender/Dodger/Defender \n* Copyright/Patents/Trademarks\n* Formal/informal\n* Market/Mixed economy\n* Normative Pillars\n* Theocratic Law/Totalitarian\n* Transaction Costs \n* Indifference Curve\n* Average Total Costs\n* Marginal Costs/Marginal Revenue\n* Nash Equilibrium/Prisoners Dilemma\n* Money Multiplier\n* Multiplier Effect\n* Tariff\n* Nominal GDP/GDP Deflator\n\nWishing you all the bestest luck \ud83c\udf40 and good vibes!!

    "selftext": "Going into this class, I was really anxious after reading the Reddit posts hearing how long it took them or difficult it was. Thankfully, I didn\u2019t have the same experience. It took me three days in total to do this class with no prior experience in economics or business. You can probably do it even shorter since watching all the lectures takes 4.5 hours which I split into two days and the review will take a few more hours depending on if u fill the study guide yourself or not. \n\nTips:\n* (Day 1 and 2)The cohort videos for competency 3 and 4 are extremely useful and will tell you everything you need for know for the OA. Skip the ones with Dr. Behroz Baraghoshi and just read the slides instead. This will take \n* (Day 3) Used the study guide to fill in the gaps for competencies 1, 2, 5\n* (Day 3) DO THE END OF CHAPTER QUIZZES!!! Specifically the Pre-OA review tests for all competencies which just combines everything. It was THE MOST USEFUL, most similar to OA and has the same type of wording. I even saw the same questions from those quizzes in the OA. (I skipped competencies 3 and 4 and you can see how I did worse) \n\nMajority of things in my OA:\n* Institution based view and all about that \n* Three types of globalization \n* OLI specifically about location \n* Free market view \n* Disadvantages for home country \n* All about collusion \n* All about 4 strategies to fight MNEs (dodger, contender, defender, extender) \n* how inflation and interest affects exchange rate \n* Currency hedging \n* All about type of currency transactions (spot, forward, currency) \n* First mover and late mover \n* All about regulatory, normative, and cognitive pillar \n* Civil Law, Common law, theocratic law \n* a few questions about market economy (just pick the one with no government involvement) \n* political risk impact \n* properly and intellectual rights \n* indifference curve \n* definitions for average fixed costs, marginal costs \n* honestly like maybe two questions about demand and supply \n* barriers of entry \n* MR= MC for everything, only price is different for monopolistic, monopoly, and oligopoly \n* Nash Equillibrium and Prisonors Dilemma \n* what increase and decreases money supply! And don\u2019t mix up interest rate with discount rate! \n* Deadweight loss \n* how does tariffs affect price and demand \n* components of gdp and examples \n* consumer and producer surplus \n* cross price elasticity \n* normal and inferior good and demand \n* fiscal policy and affect on demand \n* affect of aggregate demand \n\nYou don\u2019t need to memorize a lot of things as you can understand the concepts such as the perfect, monopolistic, etc competition or the graphs. You can either just draw the graphs to get the answer or use logic such as if supply decreases then quantity will definitely decreases and price will go up because it\u2019s more \u201cdifficult to get\u201d. And remember that there\u2019s only 50 questions so it is usually the main things in every competency that they\u2019ll ask, nothing extremely detailed.\n\nI just took the OA so a lot of it is fresh in my mind.

I don\u2019t know how helpful these notes will be to you but wanted to share anyway. \n\nI studied for two days. Excessively.\n\nWatch all of the competency videos. They seem overwhelming but totally worth it. All of them.\n\nI didn\u2019t take any of the chapter quizzes.\n\nKnow the exact definition of globalization. Know how the demand and supply curve move and why: Which direction (up down, left right), what causes the movement, etc. I drew a lot of the charts which was helpful for understanding but not necessary. Know tariffs. What is PPP? Oligopoly v. monopoly v. perfect competition. What is GDP and GDP inflator? What does it mean for something to be elastic? Non-equity example. Dead weight loss. Market economy, command economy, mixed economy. Also I was surprised there was a mention of who came up with one of the concepts. Consumer surplus, producer surplus. What is a copyright used for? MNE strategies: contender, defender, dodger, extender: understand what they do and why (which ones do abroad/overseas expansion). Which markets can do short run and long run? The section about increasing/decreasing money supply is helpful. Complementary and substitution. No equations needed. There were a couple subtraction and addition questions about surplus. Just understand that consumer surplus and producer surplus equal total surplus. \n\nMy notes are an absolute mess and there is no rhyme or reason to them. I originally started by going by the study guide and realized that was going to take forever, so then I wrote key terms down from another Reddit post\u2026 which is why some terms don\u2019t have anything written beside them. Don\u2019t take that as they\u2019re not important, I just didn\u2019t have a lot of time.\n\nHope this chaos of a post is even slightly helpful.

(I highly recommend you follow it to some capacity--it really helped me focus on what I NEEDED to know vs what I could sort of kinda be familiar with.)  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU\\_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211\\_was\\_not\\_heaven\\_tips\\_on\\_how\\_i\\_passed\\_first/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU_MBA/comments/1cm1s6d/c211_was_not_heaven_tips_on_how_i_passed_first/)\n\nIf I were you, I would memorize the following cheat sheet:\n\n\\- memorize the Market Types and Characteristics of each (brain dump to your whiteboard when you test)  \n\\- \"Harry's Many Friendly Dogs Make Fun, Interesting Playmates, Offering Unique Hugs\" which basically means: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b7dk0uy3a0fe1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f5671ba1b7e1afacf731deead0c3164dd9aa31e\n\n\\- draw the Supply and Demand curves (watch this video to learn how: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfAuucWr2Do) \n\n\\- know where the Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus is on a Demand/Supply curve\n\n\\- know that when the question talks about elasticity and mentions SUBSTITUTION think POSITIVE and COMPLEMENT think NEGATIVE\n\n\\- know what increases or decreases the money supply\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12xet3uta0fe1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=74efe004360bf54221ff4beef94d93ba69b9a0ce\n\n  \n2.) A fellow student shared their notes with me (basically it's the v3 Study Guide with answers filled in already) so I took them and imported to my iPad as a PDF and wrote extra notes as I read through to get a quick overview of what the heck is being tested on. I ONLY watched the main Competency cohort videos while reading through the study guide to help me out. Dr. Baroshi(?) (I forget how you say his name but his videos are wack because he just reads off the slides and isn't helpful.) The true hero is the other Dr. that made most of the videos. \n\n3.) Take as many quizzes as you want (I mainly stuck to the end of chapter quizzes, not the mini quizzes since those questions were on the main end of chapter quizzes)\n\n4.) I downloaded the course textbooks as PDFs and imported them to Google's Notebook LM and asked it questions from the study guide or PA that I needed extra help with and it did a much better job of giving me more relevant answers than ChatGPT, because Notebook LM ONLY uses the data from the textbooks to supply answers--thereby giving me more confidence that the material I was learning was more relevant to what the course PA/OA questions are like. This helped a lot, but I also used ChatGPT to help me come up with pro tips and acronyms to remember stuff.\n\n5.) I studied for a minimum of 3 hours a day wherever I could find the time--it sucked, but now this test is behind me and it will be for you too!\n\nPro tips that helped me out:\n\n\\- brain dump everything your cheat sheet before answering the first question\n\n\\- The PA is similar to the OA so review your PA and make sure you are familiar and can recognize all the questions because you'll kick yourself when you sit for the OA and see a familiar question you saw on the PA but didn't take the time to figure out how the answer was solved\n\n\\- simplify the question because the questions are worded to try and trick you (for instance, instead of reading something like \"If supply decreases then what happens to price equilibrium and quantity equilibrium?\" Nah forget that, instead simplify it to something like \"If Supply increases, what happens to price and quantity?\" lol\n\n\\- remove answers that you know are incorrect or impossible (like I said, the questions are worded kinda difficult so if you're reading something about tariffs and a few of the answers are about unrelated stuff, rule them out) and use your best guess judgment to make a decision\n\n\\- breath and take your time, there are only 50 questions, so if you know your stuff the test will be quick\n\nI hope this helps! Feel free to hit me up on DM for a copy of my notes. On to the capstone!\n\n",

I really want to learn how to approach these labs step by step instead of just memorizing answers.  \n\n\n\nFor those who have completed D335:  \n\n\n\nHow did you approach the labs when you didn\u2019t know where to start?  \n\nAre there any strategies or frameworks that helped you break down the problems?  \n\nDid you find any specific resources (videos, textbooks, outside practice) that helped you develop your problem-solving skills?\n\nIs there a common pattern to how these labs are structured that I should look for?  \n\nHow do you go from reading the material to actually applying it in a meaningful way? \n\n\n\nI\u2019d really appreciate any advice from those who have been through this. I want to actually understand the process, not just brute force my way through by memorizing answers. Any insights would be super helpful!  \n\n\n\nThanks in advance!",

They stated in an email that my transfer would be re-evaluated after I was assigned to the C# track, which would happen \"after my first term.\" \n\n  \nI want to finish this in the one term, and from what I can see D278 is early in the program (I am a returning student so I can see fuckall but confetti, very annoying). Can my mentor just assign me to the C# track on the 1st? Apparently she cannot see my degree plan until then either, but she doesn't work that day. She intends to approve terms that day, but if I can't move classes around then will I be stuck doing whatever she chose until I can talk to her on the 3rd? \n\n\n\nI've been pre-studying using the subs here and preparing to really hit the ground running, assuming that the courses I have been practicing come up first.",

I only studied ZyBooks, doing the chapters and labs suggested in the course notes over two months. When I needed a better explanation of things, I'd check in with ChatGPT. I tried to make sure that I understood WTH I was doing and why before moving on to the next exercise. By the end of the course I would usually finish an exercise in multiple ways just to compare solutions. Getting this score is unbelievably validating when I wasn't so sure that I would make a decent programmer. I also confirmed during this course that I love programming -- I have spent entire days at the keyboard and enjoy making solutions in code.\n\nI can confirm that as of last night, if you can comfortably work through the practice tests (33 and 34 -- especially 34) and then the WGU pre-assessment then you should be able to pass the exam. There was one CSV problem, one open-read-write file problem, and one tricky variation on the 'making change' problem that involved time instead of currency. They were remarkably similar to what we learn in ZyBooks. The remaining 12-13 problems were typical branching logic and conditional challenges. Perhaps the only things I have to add to what others have already said about it are the following:\n\n* Read the directions. Read them again.\n* Stick to ZyBooks. I don't know how I would have dealt with the exam interface in ZyBooks if I hadn't already gotten accustomed to all of the whitespace issues and just how to use it.\n* Do what the question tells you to do. If it says to use open(), read(), and write()... do so. Don't use 'with' or anything that makes more sense.\n* You're not graded on elegance, you're graded on correct output.\n* ONLY do what they instruct you to do. I did not add any error-checking unless they asked for it. If they say that you need three integer inputs, add them and don't add anything to handle strings or floats.\n* I never had to use print's 'end' method during the exam, but Every. Output. Ends. With. A. Newline. Check your whitespace by drag-selecting over your output to make sure it matches what it's supposed to look like.\n* If your output looks good, read the directions again. Check your results.\n* Finally, ZyBooks' interface and code parser is a minor pita but having to deal with its fickle nature dramatically improved my accuracy. I'm not here to get a degree per se, I'm here to become a good programmer.\n\nOver the course of these two months, I also started programming my own digital spellbook python script that I can use as a reference tool when I run my weekly D&D game. I would work on it when I was getting bored or tired of study and it allowed me to work with what I'd learned in a different and interesting way for me. Hope someone may find this helpful!",

I had been working on two other courses in addition to this one, and by the time I circled back around to this class to take the PA, I felt like I forgotten all the info already. I actually failed the PA but I studied hard for a couple of days and then took the OA. It\u2019s funny because I work in accounting for a medium sized manufacturing company, doing job costing, financial analysis, purchasing, and receivables, and for a moment this made me feel like maybe I wasn\u2019t in the right career lol. Now to finish my last paper for Values-Based Leadership before the term ends \ud83d\ude02\n\nI\u2019m curious for those who have taken the intermediates, does this compare in the level of difficulty?

Anyone that needs help with this class, you can see how much more important journal entries were more than anything! I watched Tony Bell's 10 hour accounting video and did his practice problems step by step. Another thing I did was complete the other ones he had on the document and have ChatGPT solve them for me to check my work. Also, just take the module and unit tests in the course material to check your work. If you take the PA and do well, schedule the OA because you should be just fine. But make sure you are reading the questions all the way because they might ask for equity or cash balance or something else you're not expecting based on the info you're given. Really relieved to be done with this course!",

    "selftext": "My Tips (I have no experience in accounting; it took me almost 2 months):\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Watch the Cohort videos - they will help you understand CVP, Horizontal /vertical analysis charts & how balance sheets and income statements tie in together. Plus, other stuff. I would watch those first. The \u201ctextbook\u201d will overcomplicate things. You will avoid a lot of frustration and time if you watch these.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading all the \u201ctextbook\u201d material after Unit 3 will take a lot of time & the return on investment(your time) may not be worth it. To keep it in perspective, I read the textbook all the way until the start of unit 6 & I feel I did not need to do that. I would try to skim each module to understand the main concepts and then take notes on those things.\n\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take all Unit quizzes/Tests\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t stress about trying to understand how ABC and process costing work\u00a0- make sure you understand its pros, cons, and what makes each one different\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Test Tips**\n\nAs far as the test, I would say these topics should be focused on. Keep in mind this list is not exhaustive but will help point you in the right direction:\n\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**CVP/Break-even Formulas**\u00a0\u2013 A cohort video explains this REALLY GOOD. You will memorize these; be patient with yourself.\n\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Creating Charts**\u00a0\u2013 There is a course video specifically on how to do this. You could also start the Unit 4 Test, which has a tutorial for creating these charts inside the test itself.\u00a0\n\n**3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Horizontal/Vertical Analysis \u2013**\u00a0Cohort video & Edspira on YouTube:\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[**https://youtu.be/Z5de53Fxd58?si=OckasVChW44CihSh**](https://youtu.be/Z5de53Fxd58?si=OckasVChW44CihSh)\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[**https://youtu.be/cPfWXsrfkM4?si=WPD5aDHtH84hzAOj**](https://youtu.be/cPfWXsrfkM4?si=WPD5aDHtH84hzAOj)\n\n\u00a0\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Balance Sheet/Income Statement**\u00a0\u2013 Cohort video 1 is good for this, along with the textbook itself. Understand where line items will fall under (ex. Is notes payable an asset, liability, or equity).\n\n5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Cost Centers & Profit Centers**\u00a0(What they do/differences)\n\n6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**ABC/Process/Product Costing**\u00a0(purpose of each, differences)\n\n7.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Manufacturing overhead**\u00a0\n\n  \n**Remember, everyone is on their own journey. Don't compare yourself to others based on how fast you complete a class. I have zero experience in accounting. It took 2 months because I got frustrated in certain parts; the information is new to me, and I haven't been to college in a while, so proper study techniques are also new to me.** ",

However, I retook it again tonight and noticed the excel part being incredibly different and more difficult.

I have included images of both worksheets.\n\n  \nI haven't taken the OA, but if the refurbished worksheet is a better reflection of what the OA does, then it would be more helpful for others once they remove or updated the last two questions (and I will be cooked tomorrow for my exam since I did not do too hot on this portion).\n\n[Updated??](https://preview.redd.it/bexj1a4hkdre1.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3eb20a774038bb5dd48ef0ce09923cef69aa767)\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/lef32lk8kdre1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=06ba423e4e85414f8031088188a0e4561b442132)\n\n",

One couldn\u2019t confirm if they could see me, then left, and the next proctor made me redo all the steps, wasting even more time.

I've been up and down this and the regular WGU reddit, and it seems like a lot of you guys are struggling with it, which originally discouraged me. So, the only thing I would do is to take this with a grain of salt. Your experience may differ from mine so don't be so hard on yourselves.\n*  **Do not depend on the cohorts.** If you're someone like me, you'd rather watch a video than read the textbook, but in this course the cohorts are strictly review and don't have all the info you need to complete this OA. There's a lot of information, such as terms and equations, that you need. Also, there are module videos that explain things to you so please watch those. Just watch the cohorts as it is intended; as a review. \n* **Do the Assignments.** In technicality, you don't need to do them, you really should. They test your knowledge and give you a better understanding of the information. What I did to prepare myself was to do all the Lesson, Module, and Unit assessments was to do them til I got a 100%. It does help you go a long way.\n* **Don't be shy and use external sources.** It's ok to use YouTube, Quizlet, Brainly, and other resources to help you study. There are a lot of Quizlets of the PA out there and a lot of Youtube videos that explain things in simple and detailed terms (I watch Tony Bell's Financial and Managerial videos while I was reading the textbook. Don't worry about terms that you don't see in the textbook)\n* **Talk to your Course Instructor.** They are there to help you, don't be scared to ask for help.\n* **Learn how to use excel.** There are videos and practice in your Course Search.\n\n  \nWell that's all I have to say for now. Good luck to you all, you got this !!!",

My understanding is beginning work-in-process is some leftover work from previous period. So, if we have 8,000 units, direct materials is 0% done so we still need to complete 8,000 units. Similarly, conversion cost is 80% done (6400 units), so we still need to complete 20% (1600 units). What exactly do the direct materials cost ($1600) and conversion cost ($2400) represent? Is it the cost of completing the remaining 8000 and 1600 units respectively, or was it the cost of the 0 and 6400 equivalent units? ChatGPT says it's the cost of what was already completed, so $2400 was the cost of completing 6400 units, so the remaining 1600 units would be multiplied by $1.45 to get 2320. It says $1.45 x 6400 is wrong for the cost transferred out. This kinda makes more sense because why are we using current period conversion cost per unit to multiply by the units already completed?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/55n33zp8fnle1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=2131aea61bb45bcf09a9fb38190d91735a6238d3\n\n",

For the most part the questions appear to have the answers in them and only require the knowledge of when something is an annuity due (payment at the start of a period) or ordinary annuity (payment at the end a of a period). \n\nDo I need to memorize the formulas? I was just going to use my financial calculator, but there are a ton of steps to get to the answer for PV or FV. Also, none of the questions had me calculate future value.

    "selftext": "That was probably the most stressed I have ever been for an OA. But I passed on the first go and I thought I would share what I did and what I learned to hopefully help someone prepping to take this class/text. \n\nWatch Elin's videos! I know everyone says that but she is really easy to listen to and follow. I watched the video on each unit, followed it up with the reading and answering all the questions on the walk-thru guides, before moving on to the next unit. When I was done with all units, I went back and watched the Practice Question videos for the area I felt weakest in. These videos are long but Elin provides a lot of very helpful information so they are worth it! There is no way I would have confidently answered some of those questions on the OA if it had not been for watching those practice question videos. She doesn't just give you a question and answer, she explains *why* something is the answer, breaks down key component's of complex or lengthy questions (which you will need to be able to do for the OA!) and for some questions will give you examples of how the scenario might be different to make a different answer true. \n\nDo not dismiss the tip of using your whiteboard, taking your time, and eliminating answers! The OA questions are worded to confuse and trick you. Take your time reading them. Write down the key components on your whiteboard that you need to focus on. Write down a letter to correspond with each answer and cross off the ones you know for a fact are not the right one. There will be questions that give multiple answers that appear right, but the key to the right one is who or what the questions is asking about. For example, there is a question along the lines of \"how a member-managed differs from a manager-managed LLC\" The answers include \"all members participate\" and \"Non-members manage\". The key here is the question is specifically asking how a *member-managed* differs. That was a relatively easy one I remembered but it is definitely not the only question that will try to trick you into clicking the wrong answer if you don't pay close attention to who the question is about. \n\nThe only area I did not meet competency in was the area where I did not finish the walk-thru questions or get a chance to watch the whole practice question video because I scheduled my OA before doing both of those and ran out of time. I was confident enough on the other sections and desperate to be done with the class and took a chance. \n\nOverall this course took me 4 weeks to complete, but due to work and commute time I only get about 1-2 hours of study in per night Mon-Fri. Also I have unmedicated ADHD and my ADHD and this class were practically enemies. \n\nFeel free to ask me any questions you may have. :) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef8v4sdaz1he1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc7dc5d29472337b98e5e2849f3496a4c1e6bc2c\n\n",

I passed with exemplary or competent in every section except the last one. \n\nGood Luck, fellow night owls! You can totally do this!\n\n\n\n------------\n\n\nI have been in this class forever.

All i did was go through the course modules for 1-2 days and made sure i understood some concepts i may have forgotten or needed revision on. The excel part was quite easy for me. Some advice i\u2019d give for the journal entries portion is to create t-charts for each account after you\u2019ve completed the entries, afterwards add up all  debits/credits from the journal entries to the to debits and credits in the adjusted trial balance to make sure the balance out. I honestly wasn\u2019t sure at first what the trial balance was there for but then i figured it out and once the totals balanced out a weight lifted off my shoulders\ud83d\ude2d Anyways good luck to anyone taking this course don\u2019t be hard on yourself!

They will ask you a question about a brand getting weakened the answer to that is trademark diluation. The will ask you a question about a patent and the answer is non- obvious.  \n\nKnow you LLC material inside out because they asked at least 5 questions on that.  They asked about a corporation that was taxed once they answer is a corp. they asked what a  corporation  is that operates in its home state and another state. \n\nFor agency: they asked what is it when a principal terminates the agreement with the agent the answer is revocation and then the opposite Nd the answer for that is renunciation ( these questions are back to back) \n\nThey asked about a tow company relationship with an insurance company an - the answer is independent contractor and the insurance company is not liable. They asked another question about a delivery company for a company and the answer to that is independent contractor non -agency relationship.  \n\nThe last section was pretty straight forward: they asked what document to give to investors when bringing a security to market the answer is prospectus. They will also ask about SOX on a few questions so know that the internal controls have to be signed off by the CEO AND CFO, they ask about the ethics of a company and be sure to remember the tone comes down from the top ( board of directors). They also ask when a security can\u2019t be sold( I\u2019m not sure if I got this one right so look it up yourself) \n\nI can\u2019t remember much about the legal environment so just know that inside out because it\u2019s 16%. There was one question on the courts opinion. They asked about the UCC and the answer had  FLEXIBLE in the sentence! \n\nSorry for any spelling mistakes my phone won\u2019t let me scroll up to fix them. If you remember these questions and then study the rest you will pass! Goodluck! ",

I am transitioning into accounting from the tech field. I had 0 accounting experience before I began this program. I passed this exam by a hair. \n\nI did not read any of the text in D216. I only watched Elin Meyer's videos. Only some of her videos are offered in the Course Resources. But if you email her, she will send you a Word doc with links to ALL her videos for this class. I would estimate that it's around 10 hours' worth of videos, maybe slightly more. She has videos that cover all the material in the class, and then has videos of some recorded cohort sessions she's done. These review videos REALLY helped firm up some of the concepts in my head. She picks out some questions from the PA, plus some fresh questions that she whipped up herself, then walks you through how to solve them: how to think about them, how to choose the right answer, and why the right answer is the right answer. It's so helpful. Elin also has such an incredible delivery, she has a way of teaching that matches my brain's style of learning, and I think a lot of other students feel similarly about her. \n\nI watched all her videos, and then re-watched the review ones and the ones that covered my weaker concepts at 1.5x.  I took notes through all of the videos, and I highlighted any concepts that were unclear to me so that I could look them up externally or in the textbook. The highlights would also be a great starting point for if I had failed the OA and had to meet with an instructor. I took the PA twice - once was after I had only watched 1 of Elin's videos (I failed) and then again after I finished all her videos (I passed). \n\nOverall, I'd say I spent about 20 hours on the class, maybe a little more than that.

    "selftext": "Hi Fellow Night Owls, \n\nHad a weird experience submitting an OA a few hours ago. It's resolved and I wanted to post my experience here in case it's useful to anyone else.\n\n  \nAbout 3 hours ago, I finished D103 Intermediate Accting OA 2. This was a Meazure test done completely via Guardian Browser, not an Excel MyLearning test. Starting up the test was standard procedure. The proctor was *very* adamant about me notifying them before I submitted the exam so they could make sure my whiteboard is clear. Sure thing. \n\nSo I finish, and notify them that I'm done, the proctor checks my whiteboard and gives the \"your test is successfully submitted\" chat message, then the exam closes and the window moves to an inescapable SurveyMonkey asking how my experience was. **I did not submit my exam myself and could not access it again.** \n\nI spammed refresh (as we all do) looking for a result right after but nothing happened. Went on a run, shower, groceries, still nothing. I tried going back into the WGU Assessment Center but the site said \"exam successfully completed\" or something similar.  After 3 hours of nothing, I called WGU Assessment Support. **The exam was never submitted.** WGU rep asked if it was okay if they \"manually pushed thru this submission\". and I said yes plz and immediately got a result. Yay!\n\nI described my sequence of events to Assessment Services and this was the first time they've heard of it. So putting the word out there for all the Night Owl Accounting Redditors. \n\nFrom now on, I'm smashing that damn yellow submit button myself, bump off if you've got a problem with it!!!!!!!!!\n\nTLDR; call Assessment Services if anything feels wonky - they're super helpful!  \n",

    "selftext": "Greetings, Night Owls. This is a guide where I explain the strategies and resources I used to pass the OA for D278. \n\nThe first thing you have to do in order to succeed is to complete ALL of the Participation Activities and Challenge Activities in Modules 2-6, Module 7.1 and 7.2, and Modules 8-9. You can skip Module 1, the rest of Module 7 after you complete 7.1 and 7.2, and Module 10 since it doesn't teach anything relevant for the OA. If you have a hard time understanding or completing any of the Participation Activities or Challenge Activities, you can watch these webinars that go over all of the relevant modules: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRf5DMgXLHAPm3KHH3AQZWoYzdk-FkFn7&si=1UbVX-ewJ3Ap2ObU](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRf5DMgXLHAPm3KHH3AQZWoYzdk-FkFn7&si=1UbVX-ewJ3Ap2ObU)\n\nNote that the Lab Activities are OPTIONAL, but they may help you understand the content material if you're stuck. \n\nOnce you've completed all of the required Participation Activities and Challenge Activities, you'll now begin reviewing for the OA. I reviewed by **reading** through the relevant material and exercises. You don't have to **redo** the exercises, but you may do so to further enhance your understanding of the course content. Personally, all I did to review was read through the relevant material and exercises three times over before taking the OA. \n\n  \nAs for the Pre-Assessment, take it after you review the relevant content once over. From my experience, the Pre-A was similar to the OA but that may not be the case for you. In my opinion, if you can pass the Pre-A you should be ready for the OA. If you don't feel ready just yet, then continue reading through the relevant content multiple times over to increase your confidence. \n\nThat's all she wrote. By using the above strategies and resources, I was able to complete this class in 17 days even though the only programming experience I have is writing little scripts in Python as a hobby. Just work hard, study the relevant material, use additional material such as the linked webinars and the Lab Activities if you need it, and you'll pass the OA. I believe in you, Night Owl!",

    "selftext": "Just took the ITIL cert exam earlier today and passed 36/40. Super boring class focusing on business jargon, but 100% doable to finish relatively quickly. Sharing my experience and some tips in case it helps anyone else :)\n\nPrefacing that I already work in IT and in an environment where I\u2019m exposed to these concepts regularly, so I was able to apply my knowledge and finish this class in under a week with 2-3 hrs of daily studying. If I had no prior experience though, I\u2019d say the class could take 2 weeks or so.\n\nMy main 3 courses of study were:\n- Value Insights YouTube vids (good intro to course material and straight to the point, whole playlist took about 1.5ish hours)\n- Jason Dion\u2019s 6 practice exams (questions are structured similar to real exam)\n- [this Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/771266163/itil-4-foundations-flash-cards/?i=etra3&x=1jqY)\n\nExam questions were pretty straightforward, but I had a couple questions about the continual improvement register(?), and I guessed on all of them since I don\u2019t remember ever seeing that in any of the material I studied lol. The Cohort videos and/or Sample Papers from ITIL\u2019s official learning resources that come with the exam voucher probably cover that small topic, so I would recommend looking into those for 100% comprehension.\n\nExam itself through PeopleCert and their proctoring was a bit of a pain since their room requirements were stricter (no windows and only 1 door allowed wtf), but I felt the check-in process went a lot smoother than WGU\u2019s process. Also no need for an external webcam for the exam, which felt amazing not having to worry about a tripod setup!",

I read everything, watched every cohort video, and attended live sessions, which I've never done for a class yet, but I did for this one because it wasn't clicking. And then, when it finally clicked, it felt easy. I was acing all the chapter quizzes, killing the Jeopardy and Are You Smarter courses, knew all my flashcards, and pretty much aced the PA. I felt so good going into the OA. \n\nThe questions on the OA are not at all designed like they said they would be, and sometimes I questioned if the correct answer was there, haha. I got booted from the exam three times. I would be on question 30-50, and when I came back to the exam, it put me back at 13 and gave me a whole set of new questions. I probably answered more questions from this exam set than anyone. Got to the end, and it said I was disconnected from my proctor. I did the little proctor ring thing, and got connected to one and they let me submit. Hopefully, the exam people will accept it fully. \n\nAnyways, this is a long-winded way to tell you....I don't know what to tell you. I did all the things and thought I knew all the things, but the framing of the questions is really hard. I'd just say, go for it once you feel like you have most of the stuff down. ",

So, I cannot confidently say that Elin's videos and slides will get you to pass this course, because I didn't watch her videos\n\nIt was strictly my personal preference to use the course materials because they seemed more in-dept so that they could be somewhat helpful later when studying for CPA-REG.\n\nmy OA was written and structured very differently than PA that OA froze my brain from time to time. \n\nFor example, instead of asking, \"What is the Bankruptcy Trustee?\" or \"What does the Bankruptcy Trustee do?\"\n\nIt will ask, \"The basic duty of the trustee is to collect blah blah blah ...... and?\"\n\nA.

It is ridiculous to expect students to consume SO MUCH accounting information (over 30 chapters across 8-10 modules) to only be tested with 62 questions.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not asking for more questions. What I am saying is that if you are going to give us THAT much information overload (videos, cohorts, reading, formula sheets) test us accordingly and for the love of Gee Oh Dee--let us use a formula sheet. In the real-world, employees of all kinds, including those specializing in accounting, will reference the internet or a book should they find themselves stuck on an accounting problem.\n\nIf you have the memory of an elephant, you can literally just learn from the videos. If you are a person who struggles with memorizing sht ..take your time but master a few chapters so that you don't get so caught up on formulas.\n\nThe OA asks about contribution margin and target margin. Did it ask about contribution ratio? NOOO. It asks about \"articulation\". I completely forgot what that means. Took an educated guess. It asks about the effects on the accounting equation when a transaction is made (Example: Company borrowed 50,000...how does it affect the accounts...assets increase/decrease...owners equity increases/decreases, etc). Know what EDGAR is used for. Know the differences between Cost Systems (Process, JOB, ABC) because there are multiple questions about this.\n\nLearn and perfect the chart creation process. They give you this long-drawn-out explanation in the book. All you gotta do? Highlight the months its asking you to include in the chart (OCT, NOV, DEC)...while those are highlighted, click and hold CTRL on your keyboard then highlight the amounts that correspond to those months (say cash disbursements)...THEN click on \"Create Chart>2D Chart\". Guess what? It will auto-create the chart for you. But the material wants to give you long drawn out bull. If you are comparing two figures for each mo (say cash disbursements vs net income) all you gotta do is add those secondary amounts while holding down ctrl and they will be auto-populated.\n\nMy advice? Look at 6-week study guide under the Course Tips >D196 Resources link and focus on those topics with large percents (Costing Methodologies are 20%) for example. Those that are 10%...become an expert on those topics, specifically if you struggle with remember the formulas.\n\nI swear my report shows I have a high-level competence on the subject but guess what? I forgot most of the ish I studied already.\n\nPS Just took and passed the OA on my first try today, 2nd to last day of my term (gave myself that extra day in the event I didn't make it). I'm a Marketing major btw !!! Ugh....",

April 30th (last day of my term) I called out of work and studied more, then took the pre-assessment again and passed so at 1030am I took the OA. I failed. The PA and OA really aren\u2019t THAT similar in this course. I quickly requested to retake the test and scheduled it for the only time still available 1030pm and started studying again. I officially started the assessment at 1057pm and finished it at 1231am EST (5/1). I\u2019ve seen that as long as you start the test before midnight at the end of your term, you\u2019re fine. And technically it was not midnight yet Mountain Time. But my results were not posting. As I\u2019m writing this today 5/1 @ 8am, the class is showing failed for my last term and it\u2019s listed on my new term. I contacted assessment services and I assume this will get fixed. This was the worst class I think to do this with, super stressful. If I could do it over I would give myself at least a week in this class. Hoping for an update soon and that WGU can get the class listed as passed in my last term. ",

    "selftext": "Guys, I did the OA for the new version of D427. I can tell you that OA accurately resembled the PA (Seriously). I thought I was doing the PA. Before I go into what I was asked and what you should study. Let me start off by telling you that was the most stupid exam I ever did in my life and WGU is my 3rd school so I\u2019ve done a lot of exams. \n\nFirstly, one question asked me to create a view called MyMovie. I created the view, correct syntax, but when I ran it, there was a Zybooks error that said MyMovie didn\u2019t exist even though the question explicitly asked me to create the view and call it \u201cMyMovie\u201d\u2026 I was confused and irritated. Didn\u2019t know what to do but the previous question asked me to alter a view called \u201cMyMovies\u201d. Therefore, my mind randomly said why don\u2019t you just add an s to MyMovie even though they didn\u2019t ask for \u201cMyMovies\u201d, they explicitly asked you for \u201cMyMovie\u201d. I added an s and the error went away. That made no sense at all! The question asked me to create a view called \u201cMyMovie\u201d NOT \u201cMyMovies\u201d. \n\nSecondly, a question asked me to delete all movies released before the year 2000. I wrote code, it ran without errors but Zybooks has this button where you can run the code against test cases and it provides feedback.. the feedback said \u201cFAIL: 5 movies still exist that were released before 2020\u201d. When I say that I was so dumbfounded, the question asked me to delete movies released before 2000, not 2020.. so the question asked for 2000 but the test case tested the code against 2020 instead. LOL. Since I realized this, I changed 2000(even though that\u2019s what the question asked) to 2020 and it finally worked and passed the test case. That was confusing. \n\nThere were some other errors on the exam. 3-4 questions in total that I can\u2019t remember. I wrote them down for the instructor but the proctor made me clear my whiteboard and I told her there was errors on the exam. I am so ready to report this shit so they can get it fixed because I almost failed and it wasn\u2019t my fault. It seems the new version of the course is filled with errors!!! \n\nAnyway, WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW TO PASS: \n\nFor writing SQL code:\n\n1. How to create a table(know datatypes), how to insert into a table, how to delete a row from a table. \n2. How to alter a table, column. \n3. How to drop a view, how create a view, how to alter an already existing view. \n4. How to do JOINS. My question asked me to create a RIGHT JOIN. Doesn\u2019t seem I got it correct because Zybooks said my syntax was wrong. (It was not, there\u2019s literally a reference sheet in the exam that shows you how to write the syntax). \n5. How to use MAX(), SUM(). \n6. How to use order by, group by. \n\nFor multiple choice: \n1. Know how to identify attributes, know cardinality, know how joins work. \n\nTo conclude, I\u2019ve read all the horrors about this course on here. Therefore, I was scared to take the OA. Very scared. Finally gave it a shot and passed. If you can pass the PA, do Practice Test 1,2,3 on your own. Then you will pass. Don\u2019t overthink it, but Zybooks may set you up to fail. ",

I noticed that if there were two answers that were similar and one had the word value in the answer, the answer was the one with the word value. I utilized two resources.\n\nValue Insight Video Course: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HloUhMK4E6I&list=PLVzkjYR3xN1V9nlcECuygEZVlS4rj5qaf)\n\nJason Dion Practice Exams on Udemy.\n\n  \nThe video course takes roughly an hour and a half to get through if you take notes. I wrote down the information on each slide, I memorized the key terms, and the section that covered 19 questions. The rest of it is mostly common sense and should be easily figured out. I did not have to worry about any of the information security questions, as it was just repeated information from previous courses.\n\n  \nGood luck.",

    "title": "Just had the worst testing experience D427 OA",
    "selftext": "Title. This pertains to the new version of D427 that was implemented on 5/1/2025. I had previously read that some people noticed some pretty bad errors such as the screen freezing and you're unable to put anymore inputs in.\n\nWell I had the same experience. I got to question 21 of 25 using the WGU browser ( I can't say it by name) and I could not submit any queries or go back to the previous question or go to the next question. I alerted the proctor and told him to look at what's going on. He took control of my mouse and noticed the same errors. He then opened Chrome (I didn't ask him to) and re-opened the test using Chrome. I was able to get through the test up to question 24 before the test froze again. Again, I alerted the instructor. He took control and noted the same thing, again. Instead of attempting to resolve the issue or reach out to someone, he asked me to wait patiently. 10 minutes go by, I ask for an update. He, again, tells me to wait, Another 20 minutes go by, I demand an update because we're pushing hour 2 of my allotted exam time. He ask me to wait. I start clicking a bunch of buttons in the settings portion of the zybooks test, causing him to ask me if the test works again. I replied with no. He attempts to open up a different webpage on chrome and have me input all the answers a third time, to which I stop him and demand that the issue be resolved or that I needed to speak to a supervisor. His only reply was take it up with WGU.\n\nI go back and forth a few more times with him because I'm hot. Eventually he just tells me to close the browser and figure it out. Miraculously, I was able to reschedule the test but i'll probably end up rescheduling it again. I'm still in the midst of drafting up a scathing email to my instructor and mentor.\n\n**With that being said, I highly encourage anyone that is taking this class to wait a little bit for them to fix all of the bugs inside of it. They already had a ton of complaints by the second day the course was live because people kept encountering errors when they were attempting to schedule the test.**",

Module 5 will start stats so I recommend pay attention to it.\nModule 1 doesn't count in the exam it's just as a refreshment of math very basics \nModules 2-4 are easy about fractions and you learn how to use calculator for that (which is in the videos)\n\nI was sick Monday and Tuesday so didn't study.\n\nWednesday (2nd day) I watched videos for modules 6-7, \n6 will continue stats then 7 is for probability.\nModules 5-6-7 are the most important ones and will take most of the time specially 7.\nyou then rewatch whatever you feel you need to revise, and there is 3 practice tests and full module test for each module take if you get 80% and more skip to the second module, if you don't take another practice test. At the end of the day you take the PA.\n\nThird day, I rewatched modules 5-7 and skip parts that you don't need it, didn't take 1 hour for me.

    "selftext": "Update: I passed both tasks on the first try! These tasks are not hard if you stick to the rubric. Don\u2019t overthink it. The rubric tells you exactly what you need to get \u201ccompetent\u201d and the instructions/questions are straight forward. On a side note, this is the fastest I\u2019ve ever received a task evaluation back (less than 24 hours)\n\n\nThe PA for D333 went live today, 5/6/25. I requested my mentor switch me over yesterday, and when I checked today at around noon Central time, it had switched. It took me about 3.5 hours (with breaks) to write Task 1 and another 2 hours (no breaks) for Task 2 (2 pages each task, give or take). The tasks themselves aren\u2019t difficult, but like any other PA task, you do need to follow the rubric closely to be marked competent.\n\nI requested the switch to the PA based on how memorization-heavy the content seemed, Reddit reviews, and reviews in the student  Discord\u2014and so far, I don\u2019t regret it. I'll take an essay or two over a 60-question, timed, proctored exam any day. If you\u2019re comfortable writing detailed essays, the PA route is definitely manageable.\n\nOne thing to note: be sure your sources are correctly formatted and cited both in-text and in your references section. Pay attention to the small stuff, like APA punctuation and including all cited materials in the final source list. This is always what trips me up on most PAs, so I made sure to pay close attention this time around.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say this is one of the more straightforward PAs I\u2019ve completed at WGU. It\u2019s not overwhelming if you stay organized. Glad to check this one off the list! I will update this post once I pass both tasks!",

    "title": "Passed the new version of D335. Annoying proctor experience + tips for you",
    "selftext": "First off, I had to do the exam twice. This was extremely annoying!!!! I got to question 15 and Zybooks froze. I was able to click everything else except buttons inside the Zybooks window. The proctor was no help( I guess he doesn\u2019t work for Zybooks so he wouldn\u2019t know anything). The proctor before this one was so sensitive about my camera angle, and claimed he couldn\u2019t connect to my computer even though the little window said connected and he left for some reason. Anyway, nothing worked so, turns out, I had to just retake the exam. Thank God I still passed!!! \n\n\nSecondly, there were 15 questions. And some of the questions, just like the Pre-Assessment, the question asked for one thing but the Zybooks test case is asking for something else. For example, the input statement is preloaded into the window, so Zybooks wrote this for you. It would say input(\u201cEnter your name\u201d). And then when you write your code and run the test case, it comes back and fail your code and tell you that you shouldn\u2019t have \u201center your name\u201d, you should have \u201center the name\u201d instead. Even though you did not write it, nor did the question asked you to alter it or write a particular thing. That made no sense. But thank God I could see the test case and correct anything that was off according to Zybooks and pass. \n\nNow to pass the exam: In a nutshell, make sure you know how to: \n\n1. Grab the index of a value in a list or grab the value using the index. list.index(value) / list[index] \n\n2. Know how to convert data types. Int(), str(), float(). \n\n3. Know how to read from a file, know how to write to a file. Know how to read from a csv. My CSV question asked me to print the last string in each line of strings in the file. I can show you how to do this if you don\u2019t know how. \n\n4. Know how to import modules, like math and using methods provided by math to calculate stuff. Like finding the square root- math.sqrt().. this question also required me to write code to determine if there was a perfect square when the square root was found, did not expect that at all \ud83d\ude02\n\n5. Know how to grab dictionary values. \n\n6. Know how to perform repeated inputs from the user. For example: if the user enters 3, know how to ask them for something 3 times since they entered 3.. feel me? \n\n7. Know how to grab the type of data type using type(). \n\n8. Know how to format strings, if it\u2019s two decimal places, if it\u2019s 1, if it\u2019s 3.. know how to output a number and make it have a certain amount of decimal places.\n\n9. Know how to use % and // combined to split numbers. Like a question asked me to split a 11 digit number(99887788990) into +9-988-778-8990. Zybooks teaches you to use % and // to do this. Also, % and // comes in handy in another question which I didn\u2019t answer because I just couldn\u2019t do it for some reason. So I definitely got 14/15 or something. Anyway, the question asked me to find the days, hours and minutes given a certain amount of minutes. I\u2019m sure you use % or // to do that one but I just couldn\u2019t do it. The math wasn\u2019t clicking for me at the time \ud83e\udd23\n\n10. RUN YOUR CODE, TEST IT. THEN SUBMIT THE TEST CASES, CHECK IF ALL OF THEM PASSED, IF THEY DONT, FOLLOW THE FEEDBACK, EVEN IF ITS DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL QUESTION AND YOU\u2019LL PASS. \n\nThey will probably fix the errors in Zybooks  or something by the time you take it, idk, but just in case they don\u2019t. Please check the test cases and the feedback before thinking you\u2019re all set. That\u2019s all I remember from the exam. Good luck! \n\n11. Do practice tests 2 labs in Zybooks, do the Pre-Assessment. If you can do both of these without ANY OUTSIDE HELP, you\u2019re ready for that OA!!!  That\u2019s all I used to pass and honestly, I had some coding experience but I couldn\u2019t use it to pass without doing some studying. \n",

They give a ton of information that you don\u2019t need. Make sure you have familiarity with all of the listed calculations And the review the Boot Camp video. I would say that helped me the most. Dr. H\u2018s videos helped as well, but if you do those and the Boot Camp, you should be good. I did not read the book at all. A couple of things I remember from the test:\n1. They are going to ask you about 10 different ways in different scenarios on how to maximize share value. You just have to read each of the responses. How do you maximize shareholder value? By keeping the customers happy,keeping the shareholders happy, mitigating too much risk, and slowly increasing your profits and growth over time.\n2. The bond calculations were difficult for me because I forgot how to divide the rate and multiply the number of periods. I think I was just in information overload, especially when they give you the market rate and the discount rate and two different numbers. Listen closely on how to do the excels, they won\u2019t have the complete formula of how to calculate the rate if it\u2019s semi annual and the NPER, but I attended Lenora\u2018s online class and Dr.V boot camp helped a lot.\n3. Couple of questions on sustainable growth rate just know how to calculate and provide recommendation to the company\n4. I had about eight or nine questions on SOX and SEC. They also asked about 3 questions on FINRA.\n5. Several questions on the income statement and statement of cash flows. Know the calculations for CFO,CFI,CFF.\n6. A lot of the answers were practical information. If you understand the concept, you should be able to answer the question. A good point to know is companies that have a higher reliance on debt can get access to better loans,etc. this is also the case if they have a higher number of assets.\nPlease reach out to me if you have any questions \n",

The old version had some issues too like it couldn\u2019t find a table I was supposed to delete . Long story short the two version is the SAME. I ddnt even study the labs on the new version I just did the sections I failed and surprisingly the labs on the old versions are very similar to the new version OA. If you don\u2019t have the old labs just focus on PA is the same things. The test is buggy still but you can work around it. There are still question like on CREATE INDEX that won\u2019t let you create it so I just left it. The were about 4 other Questions which had errors .like instead of selecting movies that were released before 2000 I inserted 2020 and got it right. So just play around it. Overall the new version is EASIER than the Old one. If you still have the old one take the OA when you fail just email your CI to move you to the new one it will reset so you can take the exam again within hours. \n\nPersonally I don\u2019t like to write long paragraphs but you guys are amazing and I thought you know what this might help someone pass. \n\n",

    "selftext": "Greetings, Night Owls. I passed D335 and I just wanted to share with all of you the resources and strategies I utilized to be successful in this course.\n\nThe first thing you'll want to do is log into Udemy and find the course \"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp\" taught by Dr. Angela Yu. As a WGU student, you have FREE access to ALL of the content on Udemy if you log into the service with your WGU account credentials. Dr. Yu's course will be your main learning resource to succeed in D335. Dr. Yu's Udemy course consists of 100 days, but you will learn everything you need to know in order to pass the OA by Day 14 of the course.\n\nGo through each day of Dr. Yu's course up to Day 14 and complete all of the exercises and projects she assigns you to do. Additionally, read through a section of the Zybooks material made available to you in D335 after you complete Dr. Yu's daily videos and assignments. This will help with your understanding of the concepts covered in Dr. Yu's lessons. However, from my experience, the Participation Activities, Challenge Activities, and Labs contained within Zybooks goes way out of scope for the OA. I skipped that content in Zybooks, but you may complete that content if you so desire.\n\nAfter you've finished Day 14 of Dr. Yu's course, it's now time to attempt the Pre-Assessment. The Pre-Assessment is very similar to the OA. Both the Pre-Assessment and the OA consist of 15 questions and you only need to correctly answer 11 questions in order to pass. You should be able to pass the Pre-Assessment after having gone through Dr. Yu's course up to Day 14. But if you fail, that's fine. Simply identify the questions you got wrong, identify the skills those questions were asking of you, and then redo the days in Dr. Yu's course that covers the identified skills. However, if you pass the Pre-Assessment then you should be good to go for the OA.\n\nUsing the above resources and strategies, I passed the D335 OA in 18 days with a score of 13 out of 15 questions. If I can succeed in this course, then so can you! Just work hard and manage your time effectively. I believe in you, Night Owl!",

    "title": "Is tier 1 my best option or do I need a new mentor?",
    "selftext": "BSITM Major here, my mentor is usually pretty helpful. I had a slow start to the term (living situation issues). I know you can't ask for more when you haven't proven yourself, though, so I made sure to never ask for a new course until the current one was either finished or the PA was submitted.\n\nDue to my living situation, I couldn't dedicate much time to school, so I only got through 4 courses in the first 4 months, which I know discourages them from giving me more. However, I have since completed 12 courses, and it would've been 13, but the assessment services were going in and out over the past weekend, which made it impossible to take my OA. I transferred in 54CUs, and I only have 13 left once I am able to take my current courses OA.\n\nI am aware that I might be facing an impossible task, but I still want to try. Also, I haven't failed any OAs or had any PAs returned to me, so that hasn't been an issue yet. \n\nMy term ends May 31st, so I know I'm pushing it, but it seemed my mentor and I were able to come to an understanding after last week's call. We agreed on a deadline of the 15th for adding new courses, but then my mentor started taking much, much longer to add courses. Previously, they would've done so within 3 hours if I emailed them during their office hours, but then they started taking at least 24 hours to reply, which wouldn't be an issue if we hadn't agreed on a deadline.\n\n(Assessment services being out didn't help)\n\nToday, they directly told me they aren't moving up any other courses to this term, as the rest of the courses are too \"information-heavy\". Instead, they went ahead and scheduled me for the next term. They set the dates in the degree plan and signed me up for a term extension for the course I currently have (C234 Workforce Planning).\n\nI thought about requesting a new mentor, as that seems to be one of the best options, but I worry that I'll have the same exact issues with the next one, especially since I'm so close to the end of the term. I also don't know how long that process can take, and I'd prefer not to lose any more days if I don't have to.\n\n**Basically, I was wondering if it's possible to use tier 1 to accelerate my last few courses rather than go through the process of getting a new mentor, or do I need a new one to fix what my current one did?**\n\nAny help is appreciated! Let me know if you need more details as well. Thank you! \n\nThese are the courses I have left, if that is important.\n\n\n\nWorkforce Planning: Recruitment and Selection - C234 \n\n(studied for the OA and submitted the papers, but waiting for assessment services to be fixed)\n\nEmployment Law - C233\n\nManaging in a Global Business Environment - D080\n\nPortfolio\n\nCapstone",

That wasn't working for me so I wanted to share what did work for me!\n\nI normally do the PA before starting anything, but I knew I would struggle in this class with no prior knowledge so I didn't do that here. I ended up printing out the study guide (something I never do) and went through the entire thing over the course of 3 days. The catch here is the only studying I did was ask chatgpt to explain all the concepts to me with easy memorizing techniques. After each module I took the quiz attached to them and had chatgpt quiz me additionally on the areas I missed. \n\nI then took the PA and reviewed the concepts with chatgpt again. On day 5 of studying, I just passed the OA this morning. The OA was extremely different from the PA. Very tricky wording and I missed questions that I knew the answer to because of this. Practice lots of case study questions with chatgpt. I did a lot and it still was barely enough.\n\nMake sure you know the following: (Not just the definitions, but how to apply them to company's specific situations)\n\nNAFTA, WTO, IMF, Subsidiaries, Licensing, Tarrifs, China business, EU business, ethical practices, technology, general trade laws, agreements, etc\n\nHappy to answer any questions but y'all got this!!

But generally they are useful to familiarize yourself about zybook and labs.\n\nPractice if you are familiar with python should take 2-3 days, if you aren't just take your time (2 weeks at least) this the most crucial step.\n\nFinally the most important tip, in the study material there are 2 practical test like PA, the second one it's exactly like PA, the OA is similar with few changes, so make sure you do this test and get yourself familiar with all questions.\nMost of the people know coding but still fail, cause they write it in wrong formatting, in zybook it must be same exact format, know how to use format string and read the output format in the task, you can write correct code and just mess up because of the correct format, know how to use decimal point in the format it's almost in every task.\n\nIn the test there is run test button in each question that you would know your code is correct or no, make sure you use it to make sure everything is correct.\n\nFor who are new to coding, it's like you learning new human language, you won't pick it up in few days and run, so take your time and it's ok to struggle this is part of your journey \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\n",

I will say that this class really is as hard as everyone else says it is. Expect to put in substantial time and effort in this class. \n\nWhat you'll want to do is complete ALL of the Zybooks content including the challenge activities and the labs. Completing all of this content will solidify your understanding of the material you need to know for the OA.   \n  \nAdditionally, as you make daily progress in the Zybooks content, watch one video in Dr. Soper's Database Lessons playlist each day: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1LIXLIF50uXWJ9alDSXClzNCMynac38g](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1LIXLIF50uXWJ9alDSXClzNCMynac38g) . Watching one of these videos each day will also reinforce your understanding of the Zybooks content. \n\nFurthermore, I encourage you to also work through Colt Steele's MySQL course on Udemy to get more hands-on practice with MySQL: [https://wgu.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/)\n\nAfter you've finished the Zybooks content, it is now time for you to attempt the Pre-Assessment. From my experience, the Pre-Assessment was similar to the OA in terms of difficulty. In other words, if you can pass the Pre-Assessment you should be good to go for the Objective Assessment.\n\nThat's all she wrote! While this class is difficult and challenging, what you'll need to do in order to succeed is pretty straightforward. Just complete the Zybooks content, watch Dr. Soper's videos, and practice MySQL in Colt Steele's bootcamp and you'll set yourself up for success on the Objective Assessment. Using these strategies and resources, I was able to pass the Objective Assessment with an Exemplary mark in less than a month. If I can do it, then so can you! I believe in you, Night Owl!",

    "selftext": "D196 Advice\n\nThese posts helped me when I started so I will give my input and what helped me. I passed D196 on my first try and didn\u2019t find it too challenging but I do have some pointers for anyone willing to listen. \n\nTake your time and be patient. The OA is very different than the Pre-Assessment. I found that the OA tried to trip me up with the wording whereas the pre-assessment was fairly straightforward. I would recommend reading each question carefully so that you don\u2019t get tricked. For example, knowing the difference between direct and indirect costs, the difference between overhead costs, and the difference between costing methodologies will be important to know and distinguish between. \n\n  The test is heavy on units 6 & 7. I would recommend refreshing these modules before the test. I found that the excel portion was the same as the pre-assessment. They only had three or four CVP problems on the test which was surprising.. I thought there would be more. And they didn\u2019t put any cash flow questions on my test which I was also surprised about. The test seemed to be more focused on understand the concepts of the material more than the application of it. \n\nLastly, do not skip on learning the terminology. Study the meaning and the application of all the words associated with the course. They will ask you, in one way or another, what each word means. \n\nAll in all it wasn\u2019t a hard class like everyone says it was. Just a lot of information. Take your time and don\u2019t feel like you have to rush through the material to accelerate. Even though I\u2019m accelerating, I took my time on this class. Cheers. ",

I have three Python programming courses on that pending transcript, but I don't know that any of them will cover D278. I also have years of work experience with Python, PowerShell, and Ruby scripting, so I'm not worried about understanding the material, just getting credit for the class.\n\nIf I don't get the transfer credit, I'm trying to decide whether to take the sophia .org equivalent course (CS1101: Introduction to Java Programming) to get transfer credit, or just wait and take D278 at WGU. \n\nDoes D278 use Java? Python? Or is it all pseudocode? \n\nAre there graded assignments? Or just an OA?",

Over the next two months, he rapidly deteriorated due to what was shortly after diagnosed as an aggressive autoimmune disease. \n\nFor the first four months of this term, I was barely functioning outside of being a full time caregiver and hospital advocate. At one point, I was also admitted for a few days, and when It all started to settle down a month ago\u2014 I thought I was too far behind to recover.\n\nBut I decided to try.\n\nI did the classes that I was most confident with first, and saved the more technical classes for last. I only got through one class that first week and then barely had time to study these last two weeks\u2026 but my love\u2019s health has stabilized, and this week: I locked in. \n\nNow, In the last 36 hours, I passed my last three Objective Assessments. \ud83d\ude2d \nIt\u2019s a reminder that: \n###if you still have any amount of time left\u2014 you still have a shot.\n\nI didn\u2019t do it by reading every chapter, I did it by stripping everything down to basics and using shortcuts like: \n1. Seeing what the course objectives were and focusing on that content\n2. Cohort videos\n3. Having pages be read aloud while I read them and writing things down to make sure my brain would take it in. I asked copilot for glossary-style explanations of every concept and if something didn\u2019t stick, I asked it:  \u201cExplain it like I\u2019m 10\u201d.\n\nIn summary, some days I made progress. Some days I couldn\u2019t function.\nBut I kept coming back.\nAnd with one day left in the term, I submitted my final assessment for a class that I thought there was no way I was passing- sleep deprived and only 5 hours familiar with the material. (C955 Statistics and Probability) I finished at 9am on no no sleep and with only 3 minutes left on the timer..\n\nBut I passed \ud83d\ude2d \n\nTo anyone feeling too far behind:\nYou don\u2019t need a perfect plan\u2014you just need to continue to step forward.

I email my provided instructor constantly, and receive special study guides, and feedback that aren't provided in the course. This is EXTREMELY helpful. Don't be embarrassed, if you need help then you need help. Ask and you shall receive. \n\n- Memorize the glossary. The glossary makes up majority of the tests for each course. Find the glossary, print it out if you can, make a Quizlet, and go to town on learning this. \n\n- I don't personally talk to my mentor that often and you don't have to unless you really need to. \n\n- Get a schedule!! I unexpectedly lost my job the week I was starting school and my whole world was turned around with uncertainties and a new schedule. I'm just now getting in the grind of focusing on school. You have to focus, you can't do a little here and there. You HAVE to focus. Lock in. \n\n- try to pass exams the first time. Again, I wasn't focused due to life events and I thought doing \"a little here and a little there\" is enough to get by. I did not pass D072 the first time by just a few questions. Those few questions and not locking in cost me 3 extra weeks of study time and proving to my professors that I can retake the exam. Just try and pass the first time and save yourself this headache. You have to prove to them that you can retake this, they WILL NOT let you otherwise. \n\n- Make your own quizlets. This will help you adapt to the knowledge better because you're the one making it, and many other people's quizlets I have found are outdated or are incomplete. \n\n----\n\nJust a few tips from a (still) newbie to a future newbie, I would like to continue documenting my journey through WGU's accounting courses. \n\nPlease let me know any comments anyone has!

    "selftext": "Wanted to share what worked for me as I found this material really boring and convoluted. So if you're like me, maybe you'll find these helpful, too.\n\n\n\nStarted with **Jason Dion's** [**Introduction to Service Management with ITIL 4**](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/service-management-itil-4/?kw=ITIL+4&src=sac) **video on UDemy** as a toe dipper, but be warned this doesn't cover even half the material. Just gives you a taste of the lingo and mindset for the material.\n\n\n\nAfter scrolling PeopleCert's study materials, I realized it was all designed to be a presentation. They literally just give you slides with a bunch of fluff around the frame. So after a lot of digging for one of these such presentations, I found [**ITIL\u00ae 4 Foundation Virtual Training Roadmap**](https://youtu.be/NeR_U3oJVkM?si=oG-Axdk_ObHTnoLR) **| Led by Vishal Vyas | Presented by Knowlathon on Youtube** which was absolutely the meat and potatoes of my study materials. He's well versed in explaining the concepts instead of just regurgitating the slides which is how the material was designed to be learned (Be warned his accent is thick - adjust video speed accordingly).\n\n\n\nAfter taking extensive hand written notes (typing this stuff just wasn't working for me), **I reviewed the ITIL 4 Cram Card shared with me by my instructor.** \n\n  \n  \nAnything I didn't recognize or recall, I asked **ChatGPT\\* to \"*****Define and explain \\_\\_\\_\\_ in terms of ITIL 4*****\"** then fleshed out any missing areas of my knowledge from there as most of what was missing were smaller sections of vocab that once defined made sense - mostly. Again, hand written notes.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, I hand drew the major diagrams while watching Vishal's presentation. He walks you through it and how the diagrams are meant to read. They're intended to be a sort of 3D model, but in 2D they're very confusing until it clicks. Once you realize someone got paid way too much to over engineer these graphics, it'll be less intimidating.\n\n\n\nI then took all of the major concepts and my notes, and recreated everything in **Quizlet under a folder called D336,** [**link to my study materials**](https://quizlet.com/user/Star_Gayzer/folders/d-336)**.** I found the **Test\\*\\* feature** the most helpful in addition to starting with the definitions first, then the terms. Term then definition did not work for me. I always set the test to give immediate feedback and reviewed everything. Granted my cards are not exhaustive, but I tried to keep the word ing very close to the actual definition. I think it's important to familiarize yourself with the trigger words ITIL 4 uses to associate definitions with their vocab. For example, they like to use *ensure* when referring to a *management* concept etc. Not always true, but true most of the time. Additionally, I preferred using Quizlet on the mobile app for studying while editing in browser is MUCH better.\n\nI did take [**Jason Dion's ITIL\u00ae 4 Foundation Practice Exams**](https://wgu.udemy.com/course/itil-4-foundation-practice-certification-exams-6-exams-q/) **(only 1 and 2)** to get a feel for the style of questions. I only passed them with a 70% before cramming my Quizlet Tests instead with immediate feedback on.\n\n\n\n**After 3 days of cramming, I passed as an unconfident test taker with a 88%**\n\n\n\nI'm sure if you used this method with proper study pacing and more thoroughness, these resources would do you well.\n\n\n\n***\\*****I pay for ChatGPT so my results may be different from yours if you are using the limited free version. However, I found ChatGPT GPT-4o is effective at exact definition recall for ITIL 4 terminology, and is decent at providing reasonable examples to assist with confusing topics. Also made copying and pasting into Quizlet a lot easier than hand typing everything out.*\n\n\n\n***\\*\\*****Test feature has limited uses on free version so I bought 1 month of Quizlet to take as many Tests as I wanted.*",

    "selftext": "I hate math. I cheated/skipped through most of the math fundamentals in middle school/high school and was left with a poor understanding of any math concepts outside of basic functions and PEMDAS. I was dreading this class and spent double the amount of time on it than I have my other classes. This is how I did it:\n\n-Watch the module videos listed in the supplemental resources section. I DID NOT watch the cohorts - those start on Mod 3. I watched the full list of videos that review each individual module, which are linked inside a PDF listed in the supplemental resources section.\n\n-Within each video, the instructor breaks it down into module sections. When she finished a section, I would then go to the review/questions area of that section within MindEdge, and complete the problems. If I got to a problem I didnt understand, I'd find a problem that was similar in the video and rewatch that piece.\n\n-At the end of the module video, I'd take at least one problem set within mindedge AND the module test. I did this for every module, even though the first two modules are not on the test.\n\n-Took the PA. Repeated steps above (with new practice problem sets) for the areas I was lacking\n\n-Took the OA. Passed higher than I ever expected. Cried a little. Moving on \ud83e\udd23\n\nTips:\n\n-I can't remember where I heard it, but there is a video in the course that mentions \"no one is BAD at math. They're only lacking practice\" and that mindset really helped me get over that initial lump of fear and get started in the course\n\n-Take your time. If you need to go back through the video, do it. If you need more practice problems, do them. I have pages and pages of scratch paper with slope equation problems written all over it because I needed that much practice to \"get it\".\n\n-I found the OA to be harder. The questions in the PA were more focused on the beginning of the section material, while the OA was more focused on the deeper/more complex details of the material. Definitely make sure you have a solid understanding of Module 7.\n\n-LEARN YOUR CALCULATOR. It's embarrassing to admit, but I had no clue that you could plug in fractions as-is into a calculator. Get the exact calculator they recommend - $20 at target. This way, you can follow along with the instructor when she goes through the problem on the calculator. There's a whole section (in mod 2 I think) that goes through calculator tips.\n\n-Buy your own whiteboard. No scratch paper on the OA and the whiteboard WGU sends is awful. When taking the OA, make sure you have your whiteboard eraser too, as I had to erase to make space during the test.\n\nYou got this!",

    "selftext": "Sharing my experience with this class to hopefully assist my peers with passing as well. \n\n1. Take the PA before going into the course materials to gauge your current knowledge. Some of the competencies are intuitive, while others require knowledge of certain definitions. \n\n2. Be sure to study up on where you're lacking. Certain definition-based items that are key to know include the competing values framework (CVF), leadership styles (autocratic, participative, etc), communication styles (assertive/aggressive, lean vs. rich), etc. I would look at other reddit posts to see what else people recommend to study as well. \n\n3. I personally studied using ChatGPT because I like being able to ask for examples and having items I don't understand clarified directly through a follow-up prompt. For example, the AI used amazon as an example for a company with a market culture and google as one with a clan culture. I personally didn't touch the course materials, but that may or may not be your style.\n\n4. Take the PA one last time to solidify what you've studied.\n\n5. Take the OA. You've got a good shot at passing at this point if you've gone through the previous steps. OA and PA are similar, OA being a bit more practical in applying definitions than the PA. There may be a question or two that you didn't study up on, but the vast majority should be familiar at this point. Fairly intuitive exam, especially the ethics and emotional intelligence sections. Otherwise, make sure you remember your definitions and how to apply them. \n\nThis isn't a class worth stressing over. I'm not a crazy academic, so if I passed, then you definitely can. Best of luck with everything!",

    "title": "How to prepare before my start date?",
    "selftext": "I am currently going through the enrollment process for the Bachelor of Science, Accounting program, with a tentative start date of July 1, 2025. I had a couple unsuccessful attempts at college 10+ years ago, with some AW\u2019s and F\u2019s on my transcripts due to some unfortunate personal circumstances and sheer irresponsibility. I ended up with only 9 credit hours and a cumulative GPA of 3.0. None of those hours will transfer to WGU, which I\u2019m fine with, as starting with a clean slate seems to be the best option in my situation. At 31 years old, I\u2019m a completely different person than I was from 18-21, so I enrolled in WGU Academy and took D072 to increase my chances of acceptance. I passed that class with flying colors in 3 1/2 days, studying a couple hours each night after I put my kids to bed. I\u2019m ready to jump head first into more classes, but that\u2019s not gonna be in the cards for me. Yesterday I met with my WGU Academy Student Success Coach, and she informed me that I couldn\u2019t move my start date up to June 1 due to missing some deadlines for that start date. My question for you all is, is there anything productive I can do for the next three weeks (Coach stated they should open up orientation for me around June 15) to prepare for the rest of the first term Accounting classes? I\u2019ve already completed 24-25 and 25-26 FAFSA, done my MPN and loan counseling, requested prior transcripts and confirmed their delivery, and I\u2019d rather use this time to prepare than just sitting around until I can start orientation. I will be cross posting in a couple other subreddits in order to receive as much good advice as possible. \n\n  \nYes, I made this account today, and yes, I'm a real person.  My old reddit account had my real name in the username, and I thought I should delete that account and start fresh in case there was ever an instance where I'd rather remain anonymous.\n\n",

    "selftext": "Like most of my classes, I started this at the beginning of the term (as in I clicked Begin Course) and didn't look at it until I was 10 days away from the term ending. D080 was the last 3 CU's I needed to make the 12 minimum. \n\n**Unlike any other class at WGU:** There isn't a good Course Resource Page. *There is one, but it's just empty.* There are NO recorded co-horts, and if there are - they're well hidden. Lastly, you have to really dig around to find the videos that are available in lieu of co-horts. I was able to find a helpful page (see TOPIC VIDEO image) and was smart enough to save it as a PDF - because a few days later it was taken down, yet the links still worked.\n\nEnough complaining... Did the class over the span of 3.5 days.\n\n* **Day 1**: Units 1 & 2 (few hours - not extensive)\n* **Day 2:** Unit 3 and videos from units 2 & 3 (4 hours)\n* **Day 3:** Units 4, 5\\*, and 6\\* (about 6 hours during the day), PA around 10pm (50 minutes)\n   * **\\***= didn't read much, just did quizzes & watched videos and studied where I missed it.\n* **Day 4:** 2-hour quick review & OA (1 hour) - passed first attempt. (Yay)\n\n**Tips:** Read, Speed-read, or have your computer read them to you - but **read Units 2-4**. Seriously. Do those 3 units! Watch the videos, take the unit practice tests. You'll thank yourself later. (Any part of the course material where it said \"Watch this video\" I did. I did skip any part where it asked me to read something that open in a new window.)\n\n**PA vs OA:** Questions on the OA are very similar to the PA... however, the answers are a little more difficult to choose from. A lot of times more than one sounds right, and I just had to pick the one that applies the best, or simplest. Notice that I did better on the PA than the OA but still had a similar spread of competencies. The global practices answers were harder to decipher.\n\n(On subjective or ethical questions - If I've narrowed it down to two answers that are good, I choose the most liberal of the two.) \n\nOne more tip... It'll be a struggle - but watch the Topic Videos from the course instructors. (If you can find them.) All of the video presentations are mediocre, but they're helpful. One of them sounds like she's whispering the whole time, another one will pop your speakers the way her audio spikes, and there's one who can probably manage to make cocaine and birthday cake sound dull.\n\n[D080 Video list Holy Grail](https://preview.redd.it/lo341okxj53f1.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=7900fd2fff0c9d94cf70d4676ce9a6fd50ec0177)\n\n[OA Attempt 1](https://preview.redd.it/ob87ygzji53f1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=417fd71a8a4e19b6f3bb232e1be563ba347784aa)\n\n[PA - Attempt 1](https://preview.redd.it/3ds9vkzji53f1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fc6aff5aa05b1705884e035772bec52767e936)\n\n",

    "selftext": "In the time I struggled with D333, I passed five other classes with zero issues. For whatever reason, that assessment just broke me and I failed it multiple times. I had heard that they started offering a version with no OA and two written tasks instead, and my mentor was totally fine with switching me. I didn't have to redo any of the course work, I completed two written tasks that I actually enjoyed writing that night and passed the next day. It is SO worth asking to switch if you're struggling. (i heard some say that it automatically just transitioned to the new version but mine did not at least, I had to ask). I'm so glad I can move on from this finally. \ud83d\ude05",

I had to retake the test within the proctored session three separate times due to it completely freezing and I heard other people had the SQL window just.. Not work.\n\nHowever! \n\nThe reference sheet available in the PA and OA  is a game changer and honestly kind of worth it if you're struggling with remembering syntax like I was. If you're on version 2 and willing to take the risk of a difficult testing environment I highly recommend switching. My Proctor was extremely patient though so your luck may vary.\n\nThe OA itself was extremely similar to the PA and a wonderful material to study but make sure you aren't memorizing the questions, actually understand why your inputs are doing what they do. (this has been beaten to death but VERY relevant)\n\nThe only materials I used were the Section Labs, the PA, and SQLBolt (this was huge for refresher before the test).\n\nThe course itself took me about a two weeks of 3-5 hours of studying every other day, but I think had I locked in I could have knocked it out in a week/weekend. \n\nReally, take it at your own pace and really think about what you're doing to produce what you did. \nIf anyone needs advice I'll be happy to answer any questions you need!

    "selftext": "Principals of financial and Managerial Accounting: \n\nHey guys I wanted to give my take, and tips for this class. I saw a few but hope mine might help a little more. \n\nTLDR: used Tony bells 10 hour videos one for financial and one for managerial at 1.5x speed (13hrs total) and passed in 1 week. \n\nTo start off with I took 1 week exactly on this class. I took the Pre assessment first on a Sunday, and was lacking in 3 areas with basically no finance knowledge beyond personal. I did take the excel class first, so that portion was easy and fresh. If it\u2019s not for you, watch excelisfun on YouTube. That\u2019s how I passed the excel class fast. \n\nNow a lot of people recommend Edspiras playlists on the subject, But when I was looking at them they have a combined total of around 40 hours of video (at 1.5 times speed I believe) and the videos get way more in depth than the class towards the mid way point. Problem is you\u2019d have to try to line them up with the class units to shorten it, or be willing to take more time. \n\nI found 2 videos one on managerial, and the other financial, accounting by Tony bell both add up to only 13 hours at 1.5 times speed. Now there\u2019s times where he does countless problems you could skip, and some topics covered you can skip like how to write financial statements but just try to line up his videos with the course units. \n\nI learn best with lectures (videos) and not taking so that\u2019s what I did. Monday - Thursday I watched the videos, and Friday / Saturday I took all the unit tests, and pre assessment for review. Then OA Saturday night and I passed. \n\nI hope this helps someone. Thanks\n",

    "selftext": "I am currently going through the enrollment process for the Bachelor of Science, Accounting program, with a tentative start date of July 1, 2025. I had a couple unsuccessful attempts at college 10+ years ago, with some AW\u2019s and F\u2019s on my transcripts due to some unfortunate personal circumstances and sheer irresponsibility. I ended up with only 9 credit hours and a cumulative GPA of 3.0. None of those hours will transfer to WGU, which I\u2019m fine with, as starting with a clean slate seems to be the best option in my situation. At 31 years old, I\u2019m a completely different person than I was from 18-21, so I enrolled in WGU Academy and took D072 to increase my chances of acceptance. I passed that class with flying colors in 3 1/2 days, studying a couple hours each night after I put my kids to bed. I\u2019m ready to jump head first into more classes, but that\u2019s not gonna be in the cards for me. Yesterday I met with my WGU Academy Student Success Coach, and she informed me that I couldn\u2019t move my start date up to June 1 due to missing some deadlines for that start date. My question for you all is, is there anything productive I can do for the next three weeks (Coach stated they should open up orientation for me around June 15) to prepare for the rest of the first term Accounting classes? I\u2019ve already completed 24-25 and 25-26 FAFSA, done my MPN and loan counseling, requested prior transcripts and confirmed their delivery, and I\u2019d rather use this time to prepare than just sitting around until I can start orientation. I will be cross posting in a couple other subreddits in order to receive as much good advice as possible. \n\n  \nYes, I made this account today, and yes, I'm a real person.  My old reddit account had my real name in the username, and I thought I should delete that account and start fresh in case there was ever an instance where I'd rather remain anonymous.\n\n",

Even my program mentor warned me this would be one of the least engaging courses in the program.\n\nI had no previous experience with databases (though I do have some programming background). So this was my first real exposure to data management. It took me about a month to finish, studying \\~5 days a week, 2\u20133 hours a day. I spent around a week of that just prepping for the OA.\n\nMotivating myself to study was\u2026 brutal. ZyBooks didn\u2019t work for me at all \u2014 the content is so dry it made me sleepy within 5 minutes. I quickly gave up on reading ZyBooks and instead used AI tools to rephrase the material into something more human-readable, with examples. That helped A LOT. I even had the AI turn those into digestible notes so I could review them more easily.\n\nAlso, these two playlists saved me \u2014 seriously, can\u2019t recommend them enough:\n\n1. [**Intro to Databases by Caleb Curry**](https://youtu.be/h0j0QN2b57M?si=Ris1uj6yFXIALCpE)\u00a0\u2013 clear, entertaining, and beginner-friendly. I watched this at the very beginning and it helped me build a base-level understanding of how databases work. It doesn\u2019t cover everything on the OA, but still super helpful.\n\n2. [**Database course by Dr. Daniel Soper**](https://youtu.be/4Z9KEBexzcM?si=duLNf_J9EyQ36260)\u00a0\u2013 this one\u2019s amazing. He covers almost every topic in the WGU course and explains them clearly. Perfect supplement to the official material.\n\nIn general, even though the WGU material was incredibly dry, I did find the topic of databases interesting. It was cool to finally learn how data works under the hood, especially since I had zero prior exposure to this world. I\u2019m glad I powered through it, but yeah\u2026 this one was a grind.",

I passed D196 on my first try and didn\u2019t find it too challenging but I do have some pointers for anyone willing to listen. \n\nTake your time and be patient. The OA is very different than the Pre-Assessment. I found that the OA tried to trip me up with the wording whereas the pre-assessment was fairly straightforward. I would recommend reading each question carefully so that you don\u2019t get tricked. For example, knowing the difference between direct and indirect costs, the difference between overhead costs, and the difference between costing methodologies will be important to know and distinguish between. \n\n  The test is heavy on units 6 & 7. I would recommend refreshing these modules before the test. I found that the excel portion was the same as the pre-assessment. They only had three or four CVP problems on the test which was surprising.. I thought there would be more. And they didn\u2019t put any cash flow questions on my test which I was also surprised about. The test seemed to be more focused on understand the concepts of the material more than the application of it. \n\nLastly, do not skip on learning the terminology. Study the meaning and the application of all the words associated with the course. They will ask you, in one way or another, what each word means. \n\nAll in all it wasn\u2019t a hard class like everyone says it was. Just a lot of information. Take your time and don\u2019t feel like you have to rush through the material to accelerate. Even though I\u2019m accelerating, I took my time on this class. Cheers. ",

    "selftext": "Principals of financial and managerial accounting:\n\nHey guys I wanted to give my take, and tips for this class. I saw a few but hope mine might help a little more. \n\nTLDR: used Tony bells 10 hour videos one for financial and one for managerial at 1.5x speed (13hrs total) and passed in 1 week. \n\nTo start off with I took 1 week exactly on this class. I took the Pre assessment first on a Sunday, and was lacking in 3 areas with basically no finance knowledge beyond personal. I did take the excel class first, so that portion was easy and fresh. If it\u2019s not for you, watch excelisfun on YouTube. That\u2019s how I passed the excel class fast. \n\nNow a lot of people recommend Edspiras playlists on the subject, But when I was looking at them they have a combined total of around 40 hours of video (at 1.5 times speed I believe) and the videos get way more in depth than the class towards the mid way point. Problem is you\u2019d have to try to line them up with the class units to shorten it, or be willing to take more time. \n\nI found 2 videos one on managerial, and the other financial, accounting by Tony bell both add up to only 13 hours at 1.5 times speed. Now there\u2019s times where he does countless problems you could skip, and some topics covered you can skip like how to write financial statements but just try to line up his videos with the course units. \n\nI learn best with lectures (videos) and not taking so that\u2019s what I did. Monday - Thursday I watched the videos, and Friday / Saturday I took all the unit tests, and pre assessment for review. Then OA Saturday night and I passed. \n\nI hope this helps someone. Thanks\n",

Here is what I did:\nDay 1, 2: chapters 1-4 (videos 2x speed and quizzes)\nDay 3: watched cohort recording on financial statements (they have some good tips on what to focus on). Took the pre-assessment, didn\u2019t do well, studied the terms and math problems I got wrong.\nDay 4: studied the pre-assessment for 15 minutes and took the OA\nI don\u2019t have a business background. I recommend focusing your study on understanding the financial statements and then going ahead and taking the practice assessment to see what other information to focus on. ChatGPT was helpful for explaining terminology while I was reviewing my practice assessment results. And for those wondering \u201cdo you even retain any information\u201d \u2014 the bulk of the learning for me was understanding the three types of financial statements.

I came into the course with limited programming experience with web development 20+ years ago and no professional programming experience. Python is brand new to me and I've focused a career in an unrelated field before coming back to finish a degree.\n\nLike many others, I thought I was struggling more with the zyBooks material and testing environment than I was learning the concepts of Python. The webinars \"The Gotchas\" from Jerry Spiller (especially the Exam Review video) and \"Tool Belt: Developing Skill\" from Mark Kinkead, and the \"Code-Arama\" cohort videos from Mark Kinkead were the most helpful tools for me to understand the zyBooks environment and the expectations to pass to pass the course.\n\nThe OA was very similar to the pre-assessment and practice exam 2. If you understand the concepts each of those questions are asking, solving the problems presented on the OA should not be too hard.\n\nTo learn Python itself, I did complete almost all of the zyBooks challenges, labs, and participation for chapters 1-14 and both practice tests. I did some of the additional labs, but focused on the questions in both practice tests. I felt like I was struggling understanding the material in the way it was presented by zyBooks. I read and completed the problems in Part 1 (chapters 1-11) of Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes and followed along with the Day 1-14 of 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. Both of those resources were very helpful for me to understand what I was missing from the zyBooks material. Depending  on your learning style, you could probably pick the book or videos on Udemy and be fine. \n\nI have been enjoying learning Python through this course. I plan on finishing the 100 days of Python course videos. They're truly helpful projects for learning a language and retraining my brain to problem solve for programming. \n\nGood luck everyone.",

When I completed every question I reviewed my syntax and tested with the given input from Zybooks (even tested random numbers and such outside of the given input). This is where I'm lost...... every input resulted in the expected output after running through my code I made sure to match (whitespace, caps, punctuation etc. and most importantly I didn't forget the .2f on the money/decimal questions).

The first OA was pretty straightforward and aligned with the PA.\n\nFor the second section of the course, I did all the practice questions for units 5 (TVM) and 6 (Cash & Receivables), but I didn't do any of them for inventory. (Edit to add - I also reviewed all the course material and did the learning checks, units tests, etc).  Which wasn't the best choice, but when I looked and it was nearly 80 questions.... I just decided to move on to the PA and come back to it if I was struggling.  I still got competent on the inventory section, but the OA shows that was my weakest area and could have benefited from the additional practice.\n\nThe second OA is not in Excel :(  The PA was helpful, but not fully aligned.  I think I only caught a question or two that was functionally the same as the PA but with different values.  There were several (maybe 3 or 4?) questions like this and I don't recall having any of these on the PA (this is from the practice questions):\n\n**The failure to record a purchase of merchandise on account even though the goods are properly included in the physical inventory results in**\n\n**a. an overstatement of assets and net income.**\n\n**b. an understatement of assets and net income.**\n\n**c. an understatement of cost of goods sold and liabilities and an overstatement of assets.**\n\n***d. an understatement of liabilities and an overstatement of net income.***\n\nI was really anxious about the classes with two OA's, but I loved this set-up.  Each OA is only about 35 questions, and I appreciated being able to break the course up.  I wish more of them were this way!  Good luck!",

    "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI could really use your insight. I took D196 last term and unfortunately didn\u2019t pass the OA. I did reasonably well on the PA, so I thought I was on the right track. But once I got into the OA, especially toward the later part of the exam, I struggled a lot more than I expected.\n\n# Where I hit problems:\n\n1. **Calculation-Heavy Questions:** The last third of the OA was much more quantitative than I anticipated. I was okay with basic formulas like the accounting equation and even some basic CVP analysis, but once it got into multi-step break-even, contribution margin ratio questions, and variable/fixed cost manipulation, I got overwhelmed. I think I froze on a few because I wasn\u2019t fast or confident enough with applying the formulas under pressure.\n2. **ABC (Activity-Based Costing) Confusion:** I thought I understood the concept of ABC, but the exam asked questions about overhead estimation and cost driver application that caught me off guard. I realized I couldn\u2019t clearly distinguish when to use ABC vs traditional costing, or how to identify the right cost drivers. Some questions used terminology I didn\u2019t fully recognize from the PA or cohort practice.\n3. **Confidence Erosion Mid-Exam:** As the questions got tougher, I second-guessed myself and ran out of time. I think I spent too long reviewing earlier questions and not enough pacing for the heavier ones at the end. Even questions I likely knew I started to doubt just because I\u2019d gotten rattled.\n\n**What I\u2019m hoping to get from you:**\n\n* Any tips for mastering the **calculation side** of break-even, CVP, or overhead rate questions (especially when they give you multiple variables).\n* How you prepared for and understood **ABC costing** in a way that stuck.\n* What you did to stay confident and pace yourself during the OA, especially when questions ramp up in difficulty.\n\nI\u2019m prepping for a retake and want to go in much more focused and intentional this time. Any experience, advice, or even just a sanity check would be hugely appreciated.",

Took me about 3 weeks, but could\u2019ve finished it in a week if I locked in and gave it my full attention. Tons of formulas given can lead to information overload. My advice is don\u2019t bother memorizing them. Get a strong grasp of the underlying math and you can deduce what is being asked in most questions. PA and OA aligned well in my experience. The excel portion is a beast of a COGS statement. PA excel now mostly matches with the OA opposed to the past others have written about. My advice for both the multiple choice and the excel is slow down and take your time. Speeding through the questions led me down a rabbit hole of over calculating things not actually asked. Watch the videos, take the module quizzes, unit tests, and you\u2019ll do well. Good luck!",

No joke they ask the same question like 6 times in a row with different ways of asking, and it makes you second guess if your last 4 were right lmao. In my opinion the pre test for the second OA was way harder then the actual OA itself, definitely know your FIFO and Weighted average concepts. ALSO for time value of money present value gets reported under GAAP and FASB standards. MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND OVERSTATED AND UNDERSTATED INVENTORY AFFECTS \n\nI personally didn't use the study guides. but i hear they are extremely helpful. \n\nOverall the class took me about 9 days with me testing on the 9th day. total study time was about 5 hours of focused study per day.

This course in enormous, and more than normal it felt  like the text was written by the earliest version of Chat GPT. Typos, non sensical questions in the learning summaries. Duplicative, poorly arranged material. The course resource video doc is of negligible help, and about 1/4 of the links are broken. Something that people repeatedly tried to bring up to the instructors attention with no obvious response in the course community.   \n\nIf you understand the fundamental processes to answer the majority of the question on the PA, you can pass the OA. Use the search tool in the course to look up terms or definition questions. \n\nDon\u2019t make the variance questions harder than they need to be!  I initially picked this up very easily, but the more of the course content I reviewed the more convoluted it got. If you get it, move on. Don\u2019t beat a dead horse with red pen videos. \n\nThe master budgeting process on the OA is laughable and mostly tests your ability to read, use absolute cell references and copy formulas. \n\nI checked in with Tony Bell and Edspira on a couple things before taking the PA. Learned more from them, but in retrospect has I just learned to do what was on the PA I would have been fine. I did not enjoy this class and I\u2019m unsure what value the instructors add. \n\nMaybe I\u2019ll feel better after this gin and tonic goes down. Cheers and good luck!",

    "selftext": "I am currently going through the enrollment process for the Bachelor of Science, Accounting program, with a tentative start date of July 1, 2025. I had a couple unsuccessful attempts at college 10+ years ago, with some AW\u2019s and F\u2019s on my transcripts due to some unfortunate personal circumstances and sheer irresponsibility. I ended up with only 9 credit hours and a cumulative GPA of 3.0. None of those hours will transfer to WGU, which I\u2019m fine with, as starting with a clean slate seems to be the best option in my situation. At 31 years old, I\u2019m a completely different person than I was from 18-21, so I enrolled in WGU Academy and took D072 to increase my chances of acceptance. I passed that class with flying colors in 3 1/2 days, studying a couple hours each night after I put my kids to bed. I\u2019m ready to jump head first into more classes, but that\u2019s not gonna be in the cards for me. Yesterday I met with my WGU Academy Student Success Coach, and she informed me that I couldn\u2019t move my start date up to June 1 due to missing some deadlines for that start date. My question for you all is, is there anything productive I can do for the next three weeks (Coach stated they should open up orientation for me around June 15) to prepare for the rest of the first term Accounting classes? I\u2019ve already completed 24-25 and 25-26 FAFSA, done my MPN and loan counseling, requested prior transcripts and confirmed their delivery, and I\u2019d rather use this time to prepare than just sitting around until I can start orientation. I will be cross posting in a couple other subreddits in order to receive as much good advice as possible. \n\n  \nYes, I made this account today, and yes, I'm a real person.  My old reddit account had my real name in the username, and I thought I should delete that account and start fresh in case there was ever an instance where I'd rather remain anonymous.\n\n",

I took the PA back to back while keeping a spreadsheet and taking notes and copying in what the correct entries should be. \n\n  \nThe questions at the end for theoretical are a toss up since I clearly didn't grasp most of the content. My recommendations would be review units 2-4 and take the PA until you get it 100% correct purely from memory for the entries. I think there is a study guide from what other redditors have said, no idea TBH.\n\n  \nI finished the OA in 8 minutes just from muscle memory. The structure of the Income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and journal entries are 1:1 the same just with different numbers on the exams. Just need to know the correct entries to put in. \n\n  \nHope this helps, I was super nervous after my first PA because i felt so overwhelmed and under prepared. I got through it with a force of attrition and doing what I did above. I took the PA like 11 times for reference. 5 of which were straight from memory. \n\n  \nCheers and good luck!",

    "selftext": "Here is some advice from my experience in this class, hopefully it helps.\n\nFirst off, give yourself at least a week to get through all the material. I made the mistake of focusing too much on certain sections and skimming others, and of course, the OA had a ton of questions from the parts I didn\u2019t study enough. So try to cover everything evenly.\n\nOne thing I really can\u2019t emphasize enough: know your debits and credits. But more importantly, know how to apply them in journal entries, there were a lot of questions on that in both of my OAs. What helped me was using T-accounts and the (Debit)DEA\u2013LER(Credit) method:\n\nDEA = Dividends, Expenses, Assets \u2192 Debits increase\n\nLER = Liabilities, Equity, Revenue \u2192 Credits increase\n\nAlso, adjusting journal entries were a big deal, I had over 10 questions on that alone on both OA\u2019s.\n\nFor closing the books, you have 2 types of accounts: Nominal Accounts (Temporary) & Real Accounts (Permanent Accounts).\n\nYou ONLY close nominal or temporary accounts.\n\nThe way that helped me memorize and learn this was as follows: RED(DR) - ALE(CR)\n\nNOMINAL = RED (REVENUE, EXPENSES & DIVIDENDS) YOU CLOSE THIS ONES ONLY.\n\nREAL = ALE (ASSETS, LIABILITIES & OWNERS EQUITY) YOU DONT CLOSE THIS ONES\n\nMake sure you\u2019re solid on: Depreciation/amortization rate calculations.\n\nHow to calculate the book value of assets (tangible and intangible)\n\nHelpful tip:\nLIFO = Sell new, keep old\n\nFIFO = Sell old, keep new\n\nAnd definitely understand the three financial statements:\n\nBalance Sheet = Assets, Liabilities, Owner\u2019s Equity\n\nIncome Statement = Revenues & Expenses\n\nCash Flow Statement = Cash coming in and going out\n\nKnow your formulas, you will need them:\n\nNet Income = Revenue - Expenses\n\nAssets = Liabilities + Owner\u2019s Equity\n\nNet Sales = Gross Sales - Discounts - Returns - Allowances\n\nRetained Earnings = Beginning + Net Income (or Loss) - Dividends\n\nCGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory\n\nGross Profit = Sales - CGS\n\nEarnings Per Share = Net Income \u00f7 Common Shares\n\nAnd this is super important: take all the module and unit quizzes, some of those exact questions showed up on my OA. Also, do all the Excel exercises from the book and watch all the embedded videos. It\u2019s a lot, I won\u2019t lie, but if you do all of that, I can honestly say you\u2019ll be in a really good spot to pass, just like I did.\n\nYOU GOT THIS!",

Unless you\u2019ve already completed a qualifying ethics course from another college, you\u2019ll need to take it at WGU.\n\nIt\u2019s worth 3 CUs, and I recommend taking it early in your program. It\u2019s one of the more approachable courses and helps ease you into WGU\u2019s system.\n\nYou can expect to spend 8 to 24 hours total to complete the course, depending on your writing speed and comfort with the material.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nThere are two performance assessments (PAs).\n\nEach is a 2\u20133 page paper on different ethics-related topics.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to read all the course material, but you should review the parts about ethical frameworks that are mentioned in the Task 1 PA. You\u2019ll be expected to apply one or more of these in your writing.\n\nBefore starting the papers, make sure you get the task guide (sometimes called the study guide). This is a SharePoint webpage created by the course team that gives detailed advice on how to complete both PAs.\n\nThe #1 tip from the task guide: cite the WGU course material after every paragraph, even if you\u2019re writing in your own words. This is key to passing on the first try. It might seem seem like a silly thing to have to do. But, at least you know to do it ahead of time. \n\nHow to get the task guide:\n\nIt's in the community tab I was told. But I just got in contact with the course instructor and she emailed the link right over. \n\nThe PAs: \n\nThe first PA asks you to choose a scenario that involves an ethical issue related to technology. You\u2019ll answer prompts based on the situation and apply one or more ethical frameworks. Follow the rubric and answer exactly what the prompts want. \n\nThe second PA is another 2\u20133 page paper, this time focused on ethics in a professional setting. You\u2019ll be given a website link that outlines different professional codes of ethics, which you\u2019ll reference and apply to your profession.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nThis is a very manageable course if you take the time to use the task guide, cite your sources, and stay organized. Definitely one you can accelerate and complete quickly.",

    "selftext": "**Difficulty: 6/10**\n\n(I am an accelerator so I am trying to get through non career courses ASAP, these posts are like journal entries, to help people and to self reflect)\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis was my first class related to my degree, so I wanted to take my time and not run through it. I watched Tony Bell's Financial and Managerial accounting videos to prepare. They were almost no help lol. This class is more about the *basics* of accounting and not how to actually *DO* accounting. Prepare to do excel, I was *not,* so I looked like a grandma inputting the formulas. It was pretty easy once I went through the content. The course material videos are AMAZING, I felt like it laid pretty good foundations for an accountant or business major learning accounting.\n\n**Tips:**\n\n\\-I only watched the videos, I did not read any material. I did every single unit test and quiz.\n\n\\-I made flashcards for the terms I didn't understand, I'm sure there's a quizlet for this class, but I want them for my own personal use. To use in the future, since this is my career.\n\n\\-Reading reddit comments on this class made me think that I was gonna struggle on the OA, the tests in the modules where 10x harder than the OA. I was struggling on some module tests with the amount of long word problems in one section. There wasn't a single one of these questions on the OA. Passed 1st try.",

    "selftext": "Just passed this class, took the latest version version and it had a few syntax questions, these were very specific and really tested my knowledge on SQL. The questions were ambiguous in nature and a simple word could change the answer pretty much. Like for example it could ask \u201cpick where the x can\u2019t never be smaller than y\u201d and the options are like \u201c>\u201d or \u201c>=\u201c which i\u2019d say just take it for what it is and don\u2019t assume it could mean \u201cequal\u201d as well but that\u2019s just my advice. Other strong topic was indexes, like what would happen if you ____ an index type of questions. Sometimes i found myself reading the question over and over just to find clues of what it was asking for. I read about 40% of the zybooks, Watched Caleb Curry\u2019s videos, practiced syntax on W3 schools, watched the decomplexify\u2019s playlist on databases, studied the red text document and thought i would fail mid exam. Definitely know your keys, joins, normal forms, database design and cardinality. If you feel like you don\u2019t have a good grasp on being asked specific questions about these topics i wouldn\u2019t risk to take the OA. Took me about a month, it was a painful class for sure, but my main advice is to do the zybooks(including labs), practice your SQL because you\u2019ll be studying for 427 as well. This way i plan to finish the next class soon since i\u2019ve already did plenty of querying exercises. W3 schools is a great tool to go one by one testing every clause and then you can start mix and matching and creating your own queries. Don\u2019t be hard on yourself since this class is very dense. Found myself forgetting previous materials because i was too busy trying to grasp the next concept. Definitely the amount of material is what makes this class hard.\nAs a last note, if you\u2019re planning to finish this class quickly, i\u2019d say zybooks with it\u2019s exercises + red text document is the fastest way to tackle this class. If you\u2019re a visual learner do Dr Soper\u2019s SQL course + red text quizlet. \n\nDr. Soper\u2019s playlist : https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1LIXLIF50uURxYXfBCaAXDzSdZlQiESy&si=0LWD9TXB1RlC0KVL\n\nQuizlets I used : \n\nhttps://quizlet.com/839551998/wgu-d426-objective-assessment-flash-cards/?i=5x5tdp&x=1jqY\n\nhttps://quizlet.com/1047946397/d426-study-guide-red-text-only-flash-cards/?i=5x5tdp&x=1jqY\n\n\n",

The OA was similar to the PA, but I was surprised to see a few questions ranking CVSS scores (i.e. is a 8.0 a 'medium' or 'high' or 'critical'), that was the only thing that caught me off guard. I felt the notes I took helped a lot.

But don\u2019t rush through it either, or it could come back to bite you.\n\nWithin two days of starting, I passed the pre-assessment and \u2014 feeling confident \u2014 jumped straight into the OA. Long story short: I failed not by much\u2026. Not because the material was hard, but because I didn\u2019t take the time to ensure I actually had a solid grasp of everything I needed.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: if you fail the OA, you\u2019re required to complete pretty much all the course content, especially the participation activities. They aren\u2019t hard, but they are incredibly tedious and not representative of the actual exam. In my opinion, they\u2019re a waste of time if you\u2019ve already studied \u2014 but they\u2019re mandatory once you fail.\n\nThat\u2019s the real reason I\u2019m posting this: to save someone else the headache. Even if you feel ready, make absolutely sure you are before taking the OA. Because if you fail, you\u2019ll be stuck doing hours of mind-numbing activities that don\u2019t really help \u2014 and the instructors won\u2019t make exceptions and don\u2019t care to help, no matter how ready you are. This is my last class of the semester and if I failed previous courses, the instructors were pretty lenient as long as I proved I had a grasp by the concept, but these instructors don\u2019t care about you or or your time.\n\nTL;DR \u2013 Don\u2019t rush. Prep smart. Pass on the first try. Avoid the busywork.\n\nEdit: Before anyone says anything I take full responsibility for my mistake and acknowledge this\u2026 realistically you can complete all the participation activities in a few hours, but what\u2019s the point if you\u2019re not actually learning. In my opinion, you might as well get something from them if you\u2019re having to do them anyways.",

I came into the program out of boredom and wanted to give the master's program a try. I had the following certs coming in: CISM, SecX, CySA+, and Pentest+, so that knocked out 5 classes.\n\nI immediately took the PA and OA for D487 Secure Software Design on the first day, and to my surprise, I passed. I wasn't a big fan of the material, as I quickly went over it before the test.\n\nThe rest of the courses were papers, including the Capstone, and I took time off work the entire week and did all-nighters pretty much every day to knockout and submit these papers.  They evaluated the papers, and they came back with a pass. They were easy for me to write quickly cause I've done pretty much everything the tasks asked for in my professional role.\n\nI am a big fan of the program since I do feel like this program shows what cybersecurity can be like in the real world and  I really didn't think the program was that difficult, but nonetheless, it is a good program from a professional standpoint.\n\nWhat I fear is that since I did it so fast, I am wondering if they will question the program themselves and I accidently screwed other students.  Either that or give my work to academic authenticity and delay graduation LMAO.... just to have one last look just in case (not sure if that's allowed)-.-.  At that point, I'll just try to get my money back and thank them for the waste of time.\n\nIdk, what ya'll think?",

    "selftext": "[Coaching Report](https://imgur.com/a/5yceYOL)\n\nI took the OA a couple days ago and got 100%. I tried to post this as a comment on this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1csds0w/data\\_management\\_applications\\_d427\\_dans\\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGU/comments/1csds0w/data_management_applications_d427_dans_guide/) which seems to be the most popular thread on the subject, but I kept getting a \"unable to post comment\" error.  My guess is the comment was too long so I decided to make my own post.  \n  \nI wanted add my take because it looks like recently there was a revision to the course and tests, so a lot of the information about the old versions is out of date. Let me preface this by saying I have some hobby experience with SQL, so I picked things up pretty quickly\u2014but I did read the whole zyBook. I\u2019m not great at memorizing facts; I need context, so reading the whole thing worked best for me. I skimmed or skipped a few sections, but mostly read it all and did\u00a0*every*\u00a0lab until I could finish them without help. I spent about 4 days reading (spread out over 2 weeks). After that, I pasted the Table of Contents into ChatGPT and had it quiz me with 40 questions\u2014one at a time\u2014based on the TOC. The answers were all SQL, so I\u2019d write my response, paste it in, and it would tell me if I was right. If not, I\u2019d ask for hints until I figured it out.\n\nIn order to facilitate this, I downloaded the \"sakila\" database from MySQL (the same movie database used in the zyBook): [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/index-other.html)\n\nI used Sequel Ace (macOS) to interact with the database (search Sequel Ace in the App Store). For Windows you can use MySQL Workbench: [https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)\n\nOnce I had everything up and running, I asked ChatGPT to quiz me using the Sakila database (it's a well-known database used for learning SQL). I think this helped a lot\u2014but honestly, it probably over-prepared me. I spent about two days working through the questions, and ChatGPT threw some pretty tough subqueries at me. The topics were in the book, but nothing in the PA or OA came close to that level of complexity. Take that for what it\u2019s worth. Personally, I\u2019m glad I did it\u2014I enjoy SQL. But others might see it as overkill.\n\nAs for the PA and OA, they were basically identical in terms of topics and question types (not word-for-word, but same intent). Both included a reference sheet, which definitely helped me get 100%. There were a few clauses I couldn\u2019t remember exactly, and the sheet saved me. I also noticed there were fewer than 10 multiple choice questions\u2014the rest were code lab-style questions, just like in zyBooks.\n\nSome people have mentioned having 4 hours for the test, but I only had 3 hours for both PA and OA, with 25 questions. I finished in about an hour. Honestly, with how the lab-style questions are set up, I think it\u2019d be hard to fail\u2014unless you go in not knowing anything. But that would show in your PA score too. If you do fine on the PA, you\u2019ll do fine on the OA.\n\nThe test format is identical to the zyBooks labs: you write your code, run it, see the output, then click \u201cRun Tests\u201d (basically the same as \u201cSubmit for Grading\u201d in the course material). The button on the test, though, actually goes a step further and checks not just your output, but also the format of your code. It might seem picky, but it basically tells you whether you\u2019re right or wrong. It clears up a lot of the old confusion about why an answer was marked wrong\u2014turns out it just wasn\u2019t in the format the grader expected.\n\nOne example that tripped me up on both PA and OA involved a join. There are multiple ways to write a join that give the same output, but if your syntax isn\u2019t exactly what it\u2019s looking for, you\u2019ll get a message like:\u00a0*\u201cFAIL: Check your query syntax.\u201d*\u00a0That\u2019s a huge clue. Without giving away the actual question, I\u2019ll just say the labs expect\u00a0**explicit column qualification** when doing **JOINS**\u2014meaning you need to include the table name with the column name in your SELECT (and other) clauses.\u00a0For example:\n\nSELECT\u00a0[Customer.Name](http://customer.name/), Country.Code  \nFROM Customer  \nLEFT JOIN Country ON Country.CountryID = Customer.CountryID;\n\nNOTE: I just made up this example, it is not reflective of what's on test.\n\nNotice in this example that the Name and Code columns have their table names explicitly mentioned, even though they technically don't need to be (in the SELECT clause). I did try using alias names for the tables at first, but it failed the test, so I used the actual table names instead. Also, if the lab expects a LEFT JOIN and you use a RIGHT JOIN or vice versa, you will get the same \"query syntax\" error. And if you get the table.column format correct, and use the correct join, but you mix up the order of the tables (FROM Country LEFT JOIN ON Customer, for example), it will tell you the expected output is incorrect. So this tells you the syntax is correct, but the output is wrong and you need to fix something (in this case, the order of the tables).\n\nMy point being, using the \"Run Tests\" button is what makes the test almost impossible to fail... unless you truly don't know the material. It will save you from typos or mistakes in your logic. Let me know if anyone has any questions, and good luck!\n\n\u00a0",

But using the methods that made sense to me, and going through the pre-assessment over and over to try to understand how to get the correct answer to what I got wrong, helped me tremendously. I failed my first pre-assessment attempt, my first failed pre-assessment since I started WGU, then the next day, I took it again with my own ways to solve certain problems, taking a failed pre-assessment that took 2 1/2 hours to a passing pre-assessment with an exemplary score that only took 1 hour 20 mins. And today, I took the OA, receiving an exemplary in only 1 hour and 2 minutes. The class is information heavy, overly so at times, but if things don't make sense, don't give up on the problem and assume you'll never figure it out. Maybe you need to find the way that works for you, like I did, and that's okay. Wishing everyone currently taking the class, or those who will in the future, good luck!

I've completed 18 courses since March and have started struggling to get work done on time. \n\nDuration: 15 days\n\nOA1: This portion is straightforward. I regret the amount of time I spent on these chapters. The book is awful. The way it explains things is so convoluted that I would read through the lesson and not understand a thing. I  suggest you watch these videos from edspira for the first unit, maybe skim the chapter a bit. Try to read the rest of the chapters from there, and then spam the PA. The OA and PA are practically the same. It's all just Excel. Don't overthink the exam. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD\\_8gThvHWE&t=95s&ab\\_channel=Edspira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_8gThvHWE&t=95s&ab_channel=Edspira)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD\\_8gThvHWE&t=95s&ab\\_channel=Edspira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zD_8gThvHWE&t=95s&ab_channel=Edspira)\n\nOA2: Like I said, the book is awful, and the videos embedded aren't very good. I ran most of the chapters through GPT for study guides and used those to study. I suggest doing the practice questions in the class resources for this class. These were a bit harder than the PA. If you know how to do these, then you'll know how to get through the OA. Know your ratios, Net and gross method, annuity due and ordinary annuity, lower cost or market, and how to journal accounts.  \n\nI found these videos helpful:\n\nLOWERC OST OR NRV\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyynzjP3Hy8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyynzjP3Hy8)\n\njOURNALING WRITE DOWN\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auHA-kyHk00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auHA-kyHk00)\n\niNVENTORY WRITE DOWN METHOD\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD9YK26R9fA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD9YK26R9fA)\n\nLOWER OF COST OR MARKET\u00a0\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=PnkTF6R2F7w&t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=PnkTF6R2F7w&t=6s)",

Well\u2026 I\u00a0*may*\u00a0have procrastinated a bit too hard and I'll be on quite the adventure trip starting next week !\n\nDespite all that, I passed\u00a0**D217 this morning**\u00a0on my first try \ud83c\udf89 and I plan to knock out\u00a0**D103 tonight**\u00a0after this post.\n\nThe problem? I\u2019m staring down barrel of the last two\u00a0**Intermediate Accounting (IA)**\u00a0classes and feeling the panic set in. I know I waited until the last minute, but extending my term isn\u2019t an option \u2014 it\u2019s not enough credits to qualify for another term under the MGIB.\n\nMy only goal now is to\u00a0**pass**. I\u2019m not aiming for 100% \u2014 honestly,\u00a0**80% is perfect**\u00a0for what I need. I\u2019ll forget it all after graduation anyway since I\u2019ll be gone for 2 years.\n\nSo if anyone has\u00a0**tips, strategies, or advice**\u00a0for knocking out the two IA courses fast,\u00a0\u00a0Especially if you know any efficient resources, must-watch videos, or testing tricks. I\u2019ve been stuck watching the same course videos for 10 hours a day and still feel like I don\u2019t \u201cget it.\u201d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v19oj78fxw6f1.png?width=2666&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ffffa81559f49b43d4d3ef97450f64f658804cc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/geydva8fxw6f1.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=59494d47f9337901fff0cc8c5c45552ebdade9a1\n\n",

Everyone was posting online that this is the hardest class ever, took 4 tries, etc, so I full sent it right before midnight sure I would fail. \n\nIt was not \u201ceasy\u201d by any means mainly because there\u2019s a LOT of info, but what I did to pass was study Elin\u2019s videos and did the unit modules/quizzes. Elin\u2019s videos are GREAT! She covers just about everything I saw on the test, so if you watch her videos and take notes while watching for retention along with her practice problems, you should do just fine. \n\nI didn\u2019t even pass by a hair, it was by a decent amount! Last night the portal was down when I finished the OA, so I woke up to the best news ever. I\u2019m kind of on top of the world today. \n\nAnyways, so glad I didn\u2019t wait weeks to take this. It IS NOT as horrible as people say and aligned VERY very well with Elin\u2019s videos. Ignore the horror stories! You will need to know the details, for example, \u201cwhat type of creditors and what percentage must vote on chapter 11 reorganization,\u201d or something to that effect. \n\nI feel like I learned a LOT of concepts I hadn\u2019t known from this class too, and if you\u2019re going the CPA route, you will need to know this for the exam down the road.\n\nBest of luck, and if you\u2019re in the class and have questions feel free to reach out while it\u2019s still in my memory.

I honestly didn't put as much effort into this one as I did with other courses, because the material was quite dry to me. I failed the first time I took the OA by one or two questions, and when I took it the second time I realized how little I actually knew/understood during the first OA.\n\nIf I could go back I would study like this:\n\n1. Make notecards on the red text document and memorize them all.  \n2. Take the pre-assessment, review every question, and for every question you got wrong, write down the explanation for the correct answer.   \n3. A lot of people were saying they didn't finish the Zybooks, but it definitely helped with my understanding of the concepts. If you fail the OA the first time you take it, you have to finish everything in Zybooks anyway.   \n4. The joins definitely tripped me up, so watch some YouTube videos to get a solid understanding of how they work. This one made it really clear to me: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeOJ0ZMUYw&ab\\_channel=Socratica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yeOJ0ZMUYw&ab_channel=Socratica)  \n5. Pay attention to the syntax in Zybooks or whatever other source you use, just so you're familiar with how its supposed to look and you can select the right answers quickly.\n\nI'll be honest, the first OA seemed a lot harder and one could argue that is possibly because I didn't understand the material like I thought did. For the second OA, I feel like I probably could have scraped by if I had gotten the same questions the first time around. Good luck to you all.",

I didn't even read the course material yet. And the only reason I didn't pass was because the things that I didn't get a Competent score on, I genuinely didn't understand how to do the math for as I've never been taught. \n\nIf I study and learn to do the math for it, do I really need to buy the calculator? As long as I remember equations (which I am good at, math is usually my best subject) or how to go about getting that answer, will I be fine without the calculator? I'd like to take the test tonight or tomorrow if possible. \n\nThank you.",

    "selftext": "First of all, I stressed hard about this test based on all of the comments in this sub. I watched the 3 videos, started in the curriculum, and started making physical flash cards. I was already getting frustrated because prescribed text is so thick/dense and the videos move so slowly. But I was going to tough it out. The penalty for not passing is a bunch of extra work and we ain't got no time for that.\n\n  \nLike an angel descended from heaven, /u/[54807463](https://www.reddit.com/user/54807463/) posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUCyberSecurity/comments/1lfpn2y/wgu\\_d487\\_secure\\_software\\_design\\_passednotes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WGUCyberSecurity/comments/1lfpn2y/wgu_d487_secure_software_design_passednotes/) . Nothing provided by WGU even comes close to it.\n\nHere's what I did: I gave Gemini (which is free for students via [https://gemini.google/students/?hl=en](https://gemini.google/students/?hl=en)) his study guide. And asked it to create 100 multiple choice questions from the attachments and ask them one at a time and explain why my answer was right or wrong. You can get 100 questions done within v2.5 Pro's query limit. I did about 200 questions (2 days) and averaged about an 85%. Since I supplied the source, there was virtually no hallucinations. And after I was done, I asked it to repeat all of the questions I missed.\n\nFor how I absorb information, the combination of these two things was the game changer. But it started with /u/[54807463](https://www.reddit.com/user/54807463/). I don't have gold, or even silver. But this thing that you gifted to the world helped me tremendously and I want to say thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02f8vhmytz8f1.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=498324b2f76ddf368b648ae529d80173c2386fd4\n\n",

    "title": "D487 - PASSED, here are some tips",
    "selftext": "Hey All,\n\nThis one can be a bit tricky...\n\nI struggled with this course initially after going through the material the first time lot of it didn't make sense and found it really difficult to digest.\n\nSo after failing my first attempt I realized that trying to read a chapter then watch a video was really confusing to me. I personally find it difficult understand the information like that so I decided to ignore the PC for a while and picked up a physical copy of the Book (Don't do that) It took me about 3 days to read all 9 chapters and after pretty much ignoring all other course material everything became clear.\n\nSo my first tip if you're having difficulties is to first read the book while completely ignoring the videos (Accel TIP - You DON'T NEED THE VIDEOS TO PASS THIS, THE BOOK IS ENOUGH). Once that's done you can take a day to watch the videos esp for lesson 3 which didn't have a reading assigned to it.\n\nFrom the course resources. the SDL templates 1 and 2 is the perfect study notes to gather all the SDL/SDLC activities, deliverables and goals into one place - you can find a vast majority of it at the end of chapter 9 to fill out.\n\nThe SDLC can be confusing to remember at first. FOR ME the easiest variant to remember is the one from the book that starts begins with concept which maps to the SDL. I actually printed out that page and wrote the 8 phase version on top so I could study both.\n\nWhen you get to threats/ risk mitigations and countermeasures memory tip - STRIDE = risk identification, DREAD = risk ranking/prioritization, \u00a0PASTA = complete risk analysis with 7 stages.\n\nPay attention to the Web Application Security Frame section KNOW THOSE COUNTER-MEASURES, Also know the section on RISK Mitigation\n\nLast thing, be sure to know the SDL activities mapped to the SDLC activities by heart and keep the CIA triad in mind. The reason being that when everything else doesn't make sense you'll more or less be able to see through the confusion. The questions usually point you in the right direction for eg. What is X at Y phase and that's usually the key as to where you need to look once you know the phases and the mapping to the SDLC regardless of how nice an answer may look if it's not matching the phase they are asking about it's not the correct answer, that got me a lot of times on the first attempt don't fall for it.\n\nOne last thing --- THE PA AND OA ARE SIMILAR, I wouldn't even say that the OA is harder it's just slightly different questions. HOW TO USE PA to gauge the OA -- DO NOT LOOK AT THE ANSWERS TO THE PA WHEN YOU TAKE IT THE FIRST TIME -- go back study the material ideally  you should be able to pass by studying chapters 2-7, then the BSIMM and OPENSAMM from chap 9, you can actually do it with less but if you read those chapters once then use the notes below you should be fine.\n\n\\-NOW  AFTER STUDYING IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLY PASSING THE PA without looking at the answers don't waste your time with the OA, at minimum 95% chance of failure if you attempt it. BUT if you start COMFORTABLY passing the PA without having to review your answers then you should be able to pass the OA no problems.\n\nAlso take a look at John Mientel notes it's a 10 min read but really really good. link below:\n\n[https://github.com/johnnymeintel/d487-secure-software-design](https://github.com/johnnymeintel/d487-secure-software-design)\n\nHope this helps. Good Luck!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/migk88j8e99f1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=a717452b0a56e702942cdf4a6623f9696db583cc",

    "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying that I don't usually post on this subreddit or much at all but I've seen so many posts about how hard this class is so I wanted to say something about it. For a little background, I first tried an intro to accounting class at a brick and mortar maybe 5 years ago. Failed it horribly. Couldn't grasp anything. Now? I just passed with flying colors and got exemplary on 4 sections. This may have been one of the easiest OAs I've taken, and that's saying a lot because I've done 15 or so classes and it's my first semester.\n\nI think people get spooked by the concepts and give that more weight than the actual material. I was super nervous about this class so it's the only one where I actually sat and read through everything page by page. I read each word, took notes, and did the unit and module quizzes. That's it. I didn't even reread the notes. Writing things down helps a lot with retention.\n\nI did this while being a SAHM and caring for my toddler around the clock. I've been waking up at 4 am to study and reading throughout the day. I feel pretty silly now because I could have done this at my brick and mortar but I was afraid of accounting as a concept, even though it was my major at the time, lol. I'm now realizing how much of it is intuitive. And I really enjoyed this class.\n\nI say all this to say that all you need to do is sit down, read, and focus. If you do that, the PA and OA will be a piece of cake. Nothing was hard at all. I didn't even intend to accelerate with this class.\n\nThe material is repetitive and things get a bit tricky when it comes to managerial accounting, but that's about it. The Excel portion is very simple. You just need to know that horizontal analysis is basically (current sales-prior sales)/prior sales and vertical analysis is line item/sales. Besides that, know the difference between job costing, process costing, and activity-based costing. Know the CVP formula and how to manipulate it based on what the question is asking. Know cost centers, profit centers, and investment centers.\n\nTake your time when reading the questions. Some answers are nearly identical and it comes down to nuance. I took the PA maybe an hour before the OA and found them to be extremely simliar. Not a 1:1 match but I felt prepared for what was on the test. The module quizzes were harder than the OA. Aim for at least 80% on all the quizzes and you'll be fine. I got 100% on almost all of them. If I missed a question, I redid it without seeing which one was wrong and then deciphered what I'd misudnerstood.\n\nGood luck!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o8ab5q9fl9f1.png?width=4428&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f75bc1840ee2f47af6cd3ab501ced10546c8fe0\n\n",

Most classes- I skimmed the material and took the test same day and passed. The SHRM content basically covers all the WGU content- so I felt like all of it was a review. \n\nI used Quizlet and CHATGPT often for studying more difficult concepts.

I'm also open to videos as well. Unfortunately, the WGU video did not have this specific type of example.\n\n**It is January 1 of Year 2.** \n\nSales for Mac Company for January, February, and March are forecasted to be as follows:\n\n    January, 200,000\n    February 400,000\n    March, 500,000\n\n    80% of sales are credit sales.\n    The remaining 20% of sales are cash sales. \n    Of these credit sales, 10% are collected during the month of sale.\n    30% in the following month\n    60% in the second following month. \n\nTotal sales for November and December of Year 1 were 200,000 and 400,000, respectively.\n\n**What is the forecasted amount of total cash collections in March of Year 2?**\n\n=======================\n\nAlthough I've confirmed the correct answer is $332,000, I'm a bit confused as to why. This is my first official accounting course, so I'm up for the challenge of learning.\n\nThe way I had approached this question was as follows:\n\n    January:\n    \n    200,000 x 0.20 = 40,000 (cash sales for January) \n    200x0.80 = 160,000 (credit sales for January)\n    \n    However, only 10% of credit customers will pay:\n    160,000x0.10 = 16,000 \n\n    February:\n    \n    400,000 x 0.20 = 80,00 (cash sales for February) \n    400,000 x 0.80 = 320,000 (credit sales for February)\n    \n    However, only 30% of credit customers will pay: \n    320,000 x 0.30 = 96,000 \n\n    March:\n    \n    500,000 x 0.20 = 100,000 (cash sales for March)\n    500 x 0.80 = 400,000 (credit sales for March) \n    \n    However, only 60% of credit customers will pay:\n    400,000 x 0.60 = 240,000\n\n`Cash collections total = 220,000`\n\nI\u2019m receiving a total of 220,000 (added all cash sales), but this wasn't one of the options to select. I did ultimately check ChatGPT to find out where I went wrong (after attempting to resolve it on my side), and it appears that 60% of credit sales is actually intended for January, February 30% and March 10%. \n\nI'm unclear as to why 10% wouldn't apply in January, 30% in February, and 60% in March. Why am I applying the percentages of credit sales in the opposite order?",

I picked Finance because it\u2019s about projecting money and not recording it and I find it more interesting but after really thinking about it and looking at the job market, accounting is definitely the safer option, but I like it a lot less. My main issue is I have about 5-6 months until I need to get a job again before running out of money. Is it possible to suck it up and do 67 more CU\u2019s in Accounting in that amount of time if I dislike it that much and have no experience in it?

The wording of the questions is weird, vague, and often feels disconnected from the actual course content. It\u2019s incredibly difficult to pinpoint my gaps in understanding because the feedback is minimal at best \u2014 \u201cstudy the whole chapter\u201d is not helpful.\n\nI\u2019ve done the instructor\u2019s practice test (pretty easy), used ChatGPT to generate questions based on what I got wrong, and even went through the red-font study guide \u2014 none of it helped.

    "selftext": "This course was content-heavy. I passed the PA after 2 weeks of studying but wasn\u2019t feeling too confident, so I took an extra 3 days to study and actually learn what each term means, in my own words. I passed the OA with an exemplary result! This is what I did: \n\n1. Watch all the videos and fill out the study guide. It seems overwhelming but it really makes a difference. No need to read all the material. Just the study guide. \n\n2. After you fill out your study guide, upload it to Google NotebookLM. It will create a podcast with a summarization of the material. The 2-person podcast sounds very realistic and uses easy comprehensible language. This made a HUGE difference for me. I\u2019d play the podcast while driving and at home while cleaning or cooking. \n\nWhen you feel confident, go over a blank study guide and try to answer the questions out loud, using your own words. This will give you an idea of what you still need to focus on.\n\n The OA questions weren\u2019t too difficult. However, they can be very tricky. Make sure you understand what\u2019s asking you and use the process of elimination to determine the answer. Don\u2019t second-guess yourself too much. \n\nI shared my study in the WGU Connect group for this course. \n\nGood luck!",

They usually have it resolved by mid to late afternoon. We know you're excited to hit the ground running. We've all been there. Be patient a little while longer. \n\nYou and you mentor went over you first term schedule and you should have a list of your courses. My recommendations are to google your class code and Reddit. Ex. WGU D335 Reddit. What this will do is pull up classes that other students have made outlines of their resources and advice for the course. Since you do not have access to the website, you can begin studying some of the resources that those student used that are not tied up with the website itself. They often post quizlets, google drives link to outlines, etc. Use these resources to your advantage while you wait. \n\nBest of luck and welcome to WGU!",

Once I completed all the course material, I studied and then took the unit tests. This helped space out my studying, so I wasn\u2019t just rushing through everything while the content was still fresh in my mind.\n\n\\-There where a few concepts taking me longer to understand for these I used chatgpt to show me why an answer was wrong. For these more difficult topics I had chatgpt make me mock quizes on each topic. I did over 15 practice questions for topics I didn't understand. Repetition helped me understand.\n\n\\-The OA is long, I did the excel portion first because thats easy points. Then I had time to breakdown each question and read it slow. \n\n\\-I wrote each question that had me calculate anything. It slowed me down for sure but I'd rather get it right then miss the question because of a stupid mistake. \n\n\\-Knowing what gets debited and whats get credited is your biggest friend in this class\n\n**Thoughts:**\n\nThis class has a ton of material, I normally knock out a class a day but I wanted to take my time. Tony Bell's video was helpful but it wasn't as helpful as I thought it would be. I still recommend watching it. I choose not to take the PA until I go through all material, it works better for me. Im so use to accelerating at times I wanted to skip to the OA because I knew I could pass, but I wanted an exemplary score on this OA, I got close but missed a few easy questions in one section. Chatgpt was very helpful in teaching me the material. It's a lil worrying how good it is at accounting. (Is my future job in jeopardy? lol",

    "selftext": "I honestly found this class to be pretty easy after I got over my fear of it. \n\nI did not read any of the material- I relied solely on the videos that are within the units. It took me about 17 hours after work across 3 days (Wednesday, Friday, Saturday) to get through all of the material. The only portion I needed extra help with was the CVP formulas, which I got from Tony Bell\u2019s videos on YouTube (his formula sheet I used to study is attached). Additionally, I found it pretty easy to get  100s on the unit tests and immediately took the PA when I was done, then the OA after. \n\nFor CVP, I had a hard time with this at first. It wasn\u2019t until I shortened and memorized the following formulas that I started to understand it better. Tony\u2019s video and guide is much better than the unit videos for these. I crammed these into memory and wrote them on my white board at the beginning of the test for reference on the questions: \nBreak Even Units: BEU = F/CMU\nBreak Even $: BE$ = F/CMR\nContribution Margin Ratio: CMR = CM/S\nVariable Contribution Ratio: VCR = V/S\n\nBiggest hitters on the test were:\n-understanding the difference between financial/managerial\n-costing methods\n-manufacturing allocations\n-managerial concepts (I felt it was more managerial than financial) \n-excel sheet (exactly the same as the PA) \n\nThe OA did not have the same questions as the PA, but following the unit videos will help you understand the concepts well enough to pass. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to stress about having every single concept down or reading every line. A lot of the information is repeated and built on across the modules in the units.",

I want to knock this out ASAP, and am unsure of how else to \"study\" everything. I've mainly gone through my courses with only cohorts and pre-assessments, but this one is tough, I feel.\n\nThe way it's written is way above my comprehension level. It made much more sense once I placed it into ChatGPT to simplify it. Does anyone feel like the textbooks are way too dense in terms of how they are written?\n\nI've listened to the cohorts and reviewed overall, but I'm still unsure how to feel ready and knock this out. I'm not looking for perfection; it's just a pass, LOL.\n\nCan anyone please advise me on how to get this done without overthinking the material? The material seems like it repeats itself differently since Global Business is tricky.\n\nAny help would be appreciated. Thank you all!",

    "selftext": "Hey folks,  \nI just passed C213 with Exemplary, which is much better than I thought I'd do given my lack of accounting knowledge and poor history with math.\n\nWhat worked for me was to watch the videos in each unit at 1.25-1.5x speed, slowing down if I needed to. Read up if I didn't feel confident, then take the questions at the end of each unit. In the later sections, I'd only watch the video at the top, then read the section - that felt like it worked the best for me.\n\nAs for the end of unit quiz, I took a single pass if I scored above a 60%. Anything less than 60% was a \"reread and retry immediately\". Once I finished all the units, I retook every unit quiz where I scored less than 80%, then took the PA and got Competent and Exemplary for each category. A simple review of the questions I missed before the OA was all that was needed.\n\nI'd say the OA fairly matched the PA and end of unit quizzes, so if you can do well on those, you should be fine. Some questions I recognized nearly word for word, others were very similar.\n\nAlso, Topics 1-6 are about 50% of the exam, and those were the hardest slog for me. Those sections have a lot of the formulas that will be on reference sheet during the exam, particularly the ratios. The biggest problem I had was remembering categorization - i.e. given a bunch of numbers, which ones were operating, investing, and financing; which were above the line and below the line, etc.\n\nThe only resources I used were the textbook and the embedded videos.\n\nBest of luck, and remember what Hawaiian Shirt Guy's brother says - if you're having problems remembering what something is, say it slowly.",

I am used to seeing the results immediately after taking OAs, but it still said scheduled. So I gave it 24 hours and still nothing. I called assessment services, and they said I had passed, but it was stuck, so they needed to push it through manually. They said you could give it another day, and if nothing comes up, please email them. So on 7/3, I emailed them and they told me they could see it and would create a case and escalate it. As of today, 7/7, I have heard nothing, and I can't register to take my Capstone until those results are officially posted. My program mentor has said to contact Assessment Services, which I have done numerous times with no reply. Any thoughts or advice?",

    "selftext": "Ok, so it's been a year since I started WGU and I'm halfway in the Software Engineering Bachelors to Masters bridge program.\n\nI find that a lot of the work is helpful towards pushing myself into a new career path but my biggest criticism are the Zybooks and how Testing is handled.\n\n  \nI'm not going to beat a dead horse over the proctoring software but I will state that I'm not a big fan of the Zybooks and I don't find their resources to be too helpful or to prepare you for testing.\n\n  \nWhen I started last year about every single class had recorded cohorts especially since I work nights and have an inconsistent schedule to make it to a CI's cohort, but now those resources are mostly gone. Mainly because a lot of the courses have been updated as of 5/1/2025\n\nCourse Chatter is gone, a lot of the new courses have their course resources empty, and a lot of time even after reading the Zybooks 2 or 3 times I'm still playing the guessing game, and since Janurary, Every class I took that has an OA I've failed at least once or twice, it's infuriating with the lack of preparedness and the wording on the OA's can be tricky, non-standardized terms and sometimes confusing. Especially if the test has an Operator precedence question, which can be different jumping from statistics, algebra, Python, Java, and now SQL. and a good example of this, I am in the Approaching competency bracket of D426 after. \n\nWhat I think there needs to be more of, Supplemental pretests, more transparency on study materials, because for 3 CU's, Data structures & Algorithms, Data management Foundations, and other classes are very definition heavy, meanwhile the the actual coded exam versions feel easier despite carrying 4 CUs, and bring back recorded cohorts, I don't think it's fair I'm watching stuff from C176 and having to guess what is relevant on the new version of the test and what isn't.\n\n  \nHope ya'll are enjoying the new courses and find them insightful, but I kinda wish they updated the new courses with new cohorts right out of the gate and more materials.

The school even admitted that I encountered a \"FORBIDDEN\" error and shouldn't have been able to move forward with the test, and I still failed by literally a few questions, and they won't erase the attempt. I was getting pop-ups that were distracting the hell out of me for the whole exam. \n\nThis course is ridiculous to begin with because even database admins will tell you that you don't need to memorize the ins and outs of why SQL does this and that to be in cybersecurity. I already work for a well-known security company and I don't need this degree. So I'm thinking of either transferring out or dropping it altogether. I already have a Bachelor's in BIology so if this continues I don't think I'll stick with the program.\n\nI already have Sec+, Net+ and A+. I work in security and have experience in SOC as it is. So would I be better off transferring to a Masters program online or do employers actually care about Bachelors?\n\nAlso, who is the highest person I can escalate the terrible experience to? The \"assessment review\" team was an absolute joke and told me 1) we know that the exam was messed up 2) but we won't do anything about it. \n\nI refuse to comply with the ridiculous and condescending \"third attempt plan\" that requires me to \"teach the material to an instructor like I know it\" and waste all sorts of time on nonsense when I could have passed if their systems actually worked properly.

I\u2019ve heard D196 was rough, and that\u2019s why I knew it would take me a bit. However, 1 week was plenty of time, and I didn\u2019t think the concepts were hard, just lots of material. What other courses can I expect to spend more time on based on amount of material?\n\nCourses with PAs instead of OAs I know I can knock out quickly.

    "title": "C211 Passed first try- LOADS of studying.",
    "selftext": "Hello lovely Reddit! \nI THANKFULLY passed c211 at my first go at it. I will say, WGU is known to have different versions of the Exam, and I truly believe I got extremely lucky with my version because it was EXACTLY like the PA. \nI studied for over a month tbh, but I didn't actually buckle down and focus until like a three week interval. I'd take about eight hours on Saturday and 8 on Sunday studying. The things I did to study and the things guaranteed to work: \n\n- Learn the WHY. Find examples! Make it make sense to you in real life and not just as class material. Please the best advice you should ever take from any reddit thread and the question I asked myself taking the OA was ' why'. And for the PA when I realized I couldn't say ' why' I went back and studied it! \n\n-Never in my life did I think I'd use ChatGPT, but listen...do NOT listen to the people who knock ChatGPT or judge or dismiss it outright. ChatGPT gets a bad rep because there are people who ABUSE it and use it to cheat. That will NOT help you. BUT LISTEN, ChatGPT can help break down concepts in a way and provide examples to really help you understand the materials! It even gives you graph examples and tells you why the other answers are wrong. Use this for concepts you can't come up with a ' why' for yourself! I only needed to use it for Compt 3, so don't feel like you'll be glued to it or anything. \n\n-Be familiar with the graphs ( there are no graphs on the exam) but being able to graph them on the white board is very helpful with the ' why' on competency 3 and 4. \n\n- Think of some things as ' common sense' once you learn it, some of it will click and go ' ohhhh' because it'll start to make logical sense. Ofc if the Fed lowers IR then the banks can give more money increasing money supply. Ofc a Monopolistic market wouldn't be efficient, they don't have to be and can raise price to the demon curve and lower quantity to just what benefits them because consumers don't have an alternative. But it also makes sense that they can't produce as much as they want unlike perfect competition , because if they want to produce MORE they have to lower the price of EVERY unit not just the extra unit they want to sell due to the downward sloping curve. But their goal is profit maximization so they'll produce less. \n\n- The V4 study guide was incredibly helpful! Don't just answer the questions, give examples and give the WHY. There's a prefilled one, BUT use the unfilled one, use the cohort videos to answer the questions, THEN use the prefilled one to fill in any gaps and give extra examples. \n\n-I didn't actually read much in the textbook except when I needed examples and charts/graphs or the videos didn't say something. Like on the PA they ask about mercantilism, but the videos barely talk about it. \n\n-Remember every political system has some degree of political risk, others just have MORE. \n\n-The QUIZZES and the ' pre-OA' tests are very helpful ways for you to practice your Why paired with the study guide paired with the PA. \n\n-I took a long time because I'm a procrastinator, but 4 weeks of SOLID study, I mean even if you work full time take two hours a day to study on days you work and grind on free days,will be more than enough to grasp it down. There are cases ofc where some concepts are harder for people to grasp, so do NOT rush yourself if you feel you are not ready because trust me accounting stressed me so much I got a literal hole in my throat and flew to Japan for two weeks and came back and ignored it for two more weeks before passing that exam. But breathe, trust yourself and know that WGU is designed for busy people and designed to be forgiving and you can always try again. \ud83d\udc95\n\nAnyways on to my capstone! Love yall and I truly appreciate this reddit community so much! \n",

I did my best getting through the class material and hated every second of it because of the posts that I read.  I had ADHD brain and refused to put anything into it.  You can pass this class by getting the Data Management guide that the instructors will give you.  It is 40 pages and the testing questions are taken from highlighted portions within the guide.  They are highlighted red. It literally took me 3 hours to study the guide.  I studied the same day as the OA and passed it.  I am not special and don't have experience with it.  Just tune out the Negative comments and get on with it.  ",
