Instruction:
You will receive Reddit posts about a university course.
For each post, classify it using one or more Categories and optionally one or more Intent Tags (see below).
Use multi-label conservative classification — apply multiple categories or tags only if they are clearly distinct.
A post must explicitly ask for help to receive a help_request tag.

Output a JSON object per post in the following format:

{
  "post_id": "...",
  "categories": [ ... ],
  "intent_tags": [ ... ]
}

0: Assessment & Exam Content — PA, OA, proctoring, retaking, etc  
1: Course Content Issues — outdated, incorrect, missing, or misleading course material  
2: Study Support & Resources — study materials, guides, notes, etc  
3: Course Planning & Timing — degree plan, course order, pacing guide, timeline  
4: Celebration & Motivation — passing, graduating, confetti, encouragement  
5: uncategorized — not fitting into other categories



Intent Tags:
